1		this review is about this one location 's unacceptable behavior . <sssss> to start , i like papa john 's . <sssss> * the pizza is reasonably tasty for my family -lrb- not as good as the local top notch mom & pop places , but decent none-the-less . -rrb- <sssss> * the value is exceptional - they have the best specials , which we always take advantage of . <sssss> their online ordering and reward program is unparalleled -lrb- i belong to every chains reward and email clubs , they are all pathetic . <sssss> not pj 's ! <sssss> join and find out ! -rrb- <sssss> * my local pj is a franchise that in my opinion is a model for any franchise of any type . <sssss> they know us by face and by name and greet us so when we come in . <sssss> the food is well prepared and consistent . <sssss> they service is fast and extra friendly . <sssss> they rarely screw-up ; and if they do they are apologetic and fast to fix it in a method that we prefer . <sssss> so ... what about this location ?? <sssss> we were having a family gathering in phoenix and someone said `` let 's get pizza ! <sssss> we 'll have domino 's deliver ! '' <sssss> `` wait ! '' <sssss> i said . <sssss> as the pater familias i decided to treat everyone and said `` can we do papa john 's ? <sssss> that 's all we ever order and it 's great . <sssss> i think i have a free pizza or two waiting for me anyway ? '' <sssss> `` well we usually get white pizza with spinach and veggies from domino 's '' the vegan phoenician daughter chimed in . <sssss> `` no problem . <sssss> papa john ' has that too . '' <sssss> `` do they have an online configurator so i can pick our toppings ? '' <sssss> she continued . <sssss> `` yeah , it 's great . '' <sssss> `` do they still give that garlic butter sauce to dip your crust in ? <sssss> that 's the main thing we always liked from there . '' <sssss> `` domino 's is super cheap ... '' she challenged . <sssss> `` let me login and order . <sssss> they have great specials , i 've got freebies coming . <sssss> you can pick your own toppings . <sssss> i 'll order delivery and pay online including tip for driver . <sssss> we 'll be eating in under a half hour . '' <sssss> `` ok , dad . '' <sssss> online i go . <sssss> couple big loaded pizzas for about 10 bucks each , couple free 2-liters of soda , an apple pie desert pizza at half price . <sssss> paid online . <sssss> done !!! <sssss> problems begin . <sssss> 50 minutes later the delivery guy arrives . <sssss> someone gets the door , then calls me `` to sign the receipt . '' <sssss> i come to the door to sign . <sssss> i only see the pizza 's so i ask about the drinks . <sssss> the zombie with the hot bag blank stares at me with glazed-over eyes usually seen only on reggae musicians . <sssss> i sign . <sssss> there is still no response . <sssss> i ask again about the drinks and the desert pizza . <sssss> the expressionless zombie mumbles and someone behind me yells `` we got it all dad ! '' <sssss> ok ! <sssss> `` thanks ! '' <sssss> i say to zombieman , who slowly turns and shuffles away with no response . <sssss> he was well tipped , but maybe i needed to offer fresh brains instead of cash to show appreciation to him . <sssss> problems continue . <sssss> we open up the pizza boxes . <sssss> the crusts are uber dark and burnt in many spot . <sssss> cheese is mostly brown . <sssss> i pick up and bite into a piece of spinach alfredo and it crunches . <sssss> it is completely dry , sauce was cooked away . <sssss> cheese was dried out too . <sssss> both pizzas were like this . <sssss> `` gross ! '' <sssss> `` ewww '' `` this is inedible '' `` they burnt this this ! '' <sssss> `` call them back and tell them . '' <sssss> were the comments ringing from all my spawn . <sssss> `` sorry guys ! <sssss> i 'll take care of it . <sssss> i ordered these ` well-done ' as i always order every pizza . <sssss> it makes the cheese ` break ' a little and makes the crust better for dipping . <sssss> i 've talked to store managers about this and know just what they do . <sssss> the pizzas are amazing that way . <sssss> someone screwed these up . <sssss> they are burnt . <sssss> i 'm sorry . '' <sssss> i lamented . <sssss> problem gets worse . <sssss> i call in . <sssss> i explain the problem . <sssss> i ask what they did to mess these up . <sssss> unapologetically , the fellow on the other end explains how they cooked the pies and seems to know the correct method for well-done pizza . <sssss> as a retired restaurateur , i can only figure either the pizza handled did something different , or the ovens in that store are turned-up a bit for faster cooking which fouls up a `` well done '' order . <sssss> either way , they guy on the phone was apathetic but said `` we can remake those for you . '' <sssss> `` ok . <sssss> thanks . '' <sssss> i say `` these are inedible . '' <sssss> ... click ... `` ok , guys ! <sssss> they are making new pizzas ! <sssss> an hour later . <sssss> let me repeat . <sssss> an hour later , a snarly , untipped female driver brings 2 perfectly cooked `` well done '' pizzas . <sssss> by that time , my hungry spawn had torn out and devoured all the semi-burnt-but-still-somewhat-edible-as-long-as-they-are-covered-with-ranch-dressing center nuggets of the unholy abominations this location had first delivered . <sssss> the group had subsequently moved on to the livingroom to watch true blood . <sssss> `` hey , the new pizzas are here ! <sssss> they are prefect ! <sssss> de-lish ! '' <sssss> but no one was interested any more . 
1		the service was so slow . <sssss> she did n't even come check on us despite waiting 30 min for our apps ! 
1		i 've ate at osf twice now and it was two times too many . <sssss> both times service has been horrible . <sssss> i get that working the lunch shift may not be lucrative , but yesterday i was with a group of approximately 15 and our waiter was incredibly rude and disinterested in serving us . <sssss> he was banking on the fact that he would get an automatic 18 % from each of us , which is unfortunate because for good service i will tip more . <sssss> beyond the lousy service , the food is not good . <sssss> i had the fettucini alfredo the first time i ate at osf and it was drowning in alfredo sauce ... yuck . <sssss> the salad looks like something you get from a bag . <sssss> yesterday i ordered a caesar salad as my entree . <sssss> first , it had tomatoes in it . <sssss> i really do n't like tomatoes in caesar salad . <sssss> second , our waiter brought it out with the other salads . <sssss> so that meant that when my group got their entrees , i had nothing and basically had to watch them eat . <sssss> since when were entree salads brought out with starter salads ??? <sssss> lastly the wine selection is pathetic . <sssss> there are only two white wines by the glass and the riesling i had yesterday was much too sweet . <sssss> for generic italian food , go to the olive garden . <sssss> at least their salad and breadsticks are decent . 
1		literally the worst service i 've ever had . <sssss> the baristas were too busy flirting with the giant group of guys outside drinking water to get our drinks in a timely fashion , and they forgot about our food . <sssss> horrible service and when i acknowledged them about my drink tasting funny , she did n't offer to fix it . <sssss> makes me not want to even bother with starbucks anymore . <sssss> did n't even say goodbye or thank you when we left . 
1		this place has become a real joke over the past couple years . <sssss> worse service anywhere . <sssss> they just ca n't handle it anymore with the immigration crack down . <sssss> . <sssss> the food is hit and miss anyway ... never again . 
1		god only knows how a company can hire such incompetent and disorganized employees . <sssss> does nationwide provide any training in customer service at all ???? <sssss> i just do n't get it . <sssss> with so many thousands of bright people looking for work , how does a national company end up with such terrible employees ? <sssss> i mean , how difficult is it to do an accurate eye exam and send it to the lab to get processed ? <sssss> -lrb- based on my experience here , it must be about as difficult as flying to jupiter , as they ca n't seem to get anything right . -rrb- <sssss> i 've had five experiences with this nationwide branch -lrb- eye exam , 2 types of glasses -rrb- , and each one has resulted in major errors resulting in delays in receiving glasses . <sssss> the employees do n't listen , do n't write things down , do n't follow up , and worst of all they act like they are doing you a favor by even being there . 
1		prices were cheap however food was served well after others who came in and they literally put brown gravy on the mexican food , staff ignored simple requests ... only reason for 1 star was due to price 
1		i keep giving them chances and they continue to fail . <sssss> all my husbands shirts are always wrinkled and with stains on them . <sssss> this should n't be the case because i 'm paying for my clothes to be cleaned and ironed ! <sssss> i tried to address the issue the first time this happened and one of the girls there was really rude . <sssss> i honestly do n't plan on coming back ever . <sssss> really bad customer service and they do n't do what a dry cleaner is suppose to do . 
1		i wrote a terrible review for this place and now it is gone ! <sssss> just want to say this place is filthy ! <sssss> smells like sewage and cigarette smoke ! <sssss> every aspect of this salon is gross , the walls , floors , furniture , all dirty ! <sssss> do n't go here if u want a clean environment ! <sssss> if i could give no stars i would ! 
1		i purchased a computer from your shop on a row and boy did you rip me off . <sssss> as soon as i got home the battery was dead . <sssss> also i must say i will never go back to this market . <sssss> the same stuff is down every single isle the manager must be an idiot to allow your sort of company to have a booth and allow the same sort of stuff on every isle . <sssss> worst place i 've ever been . 
1		my friend and i regularly get pedicures as our sunday `` girl day . '' <sssss> i had been here once before and i did like the paraffin wax they offer . <sssss> i had seen their mobile sign for a $ 17 spa pedicure which is normally $ 25 so we decided to go there . <sssss> it was a good pedicure ... until the end when the girl pretended she did n't understand english -lrb- although she had talked to us throughout just fine -rrb- when we questioned why it was not $ 17 instead if $ 25 . <sssss> she said that was for the `` basic pedicure . '' <sssss> we said okay , tipped her $ 5 and then looked at the sign -lrb- which had been tipped sideways on the curb by then -rrb- . <sssss> the sign read exactly `` spa pedicure $ 17 '' and that is exactly what we asked for -lrb- and reads as # 1 on their menu ... can it get any more basic ? -rrb- <sssss> we were sorely disappointed and felt like we had been lied to ... not to mention both of my flower stones fell off the next day and it chipped . <sssss> mine usually lasts at least 3 weeks ! <sssss> will not be returning . <sssss> all for $ 8 . 
1		i would n't even give it the one star :-lrb- i wish i had checked yelp before i bought my living social deal ... total waste of money . <sssss> my boyfriend a native of az raved that bitz-ee mama 's had great mexican food so i took part in the living social deal . <sssss> we finally got around to going this weekend and what a mistake . <sssss> we walked in and i was put off by the `` hole in the wall '' atmosphere but i know that most `` dive '' restaurants have good food so i decided to put snobbery aside for the moment . <sssss> we waited a lenghty amount of time for a table as it is preferred over a booth but were ok with that fact . <sssss> we were plopped down in the middle of a mixed group of individuals dressed in halloween costumes participating in karaoke :-lrb- this situation was less than ideal but i was going along trying to be a good sport . <sssss> the menu had a few mexican selections and a lot of diner type of food and my mood got worse ... still trying to be a good sport but knew this was n't going to end well . <sssss> our waitress rolled around several minutes later with chips and salsa and took our drink order . <sssss> the salsa was visually un-appealing and i could n't force myself to try it but my boyfriend said it was great ... it should be noted that he will eat most anything : / about 8 minutes later no drinks and he said let 's bail . <sssss> the waitress walked past us several times clearing other tables and we were right next to the bar so we were n't quite sure what the delay was ??? <sssss> sad to say that this restaurant lacks the charm that we were looking for . <sssss> luckily there are a lot of other great local business in the area and we will stick to visting them : -rrb- 
1		oh after so many years and so many times i have wandered in , to walk off my meals from the neighboring establishments and ended up buying stuff i did n't need , today was the last time . <sssss> being followed and asked if we needed anything in a manner like we were some criminals like out of a bad movie stereotype . <sssss> wait ... i 'm korean though and my friends are asian too . <sssss> regardless , it pains me to see the dreaded korean store stereotype come to life but also for it to happen to me . <sssss> asiana market , yes you are small and have a lot of korean items i ca n't find at other places , your prices are higher but it was the convenience i paid for . <sssss> not anymore , as of today i will no longer step in your direction , nor look through your windows . <sssss> neither this location or the other . <sssss> i am sad to say you have lost a loyal customer who had always tried to support my local business and community . <sssss> the owner if he were to ever read this or not , sir i am not sorry for this harsh review but today , your actions drove out 3 customers who ended up buying nothing and will never return again . <sssss> will the loss of 3 men hurt your business ? <sssss> probably not , but all the other asian grocery stores just gained 3 customers . <sssss> i will drive farther and longer just for that great service with out the harassment . 
1		the decor was nice ... that 's all . <sssss> my friends went here a couple weeks ago and gave praises to the food , atmosphere , and reverse happy-hour on saturday . <sssss> they wanted to go again this last friday and i came along . <sssss> the atmosphere is really nice . <sssss> i could imagine this being our new place to hang out for dinner and drinks . <sssss> the menu was also very cleverly worded and reasonably priced . <sssss> unfortunately , i never got a chance to try anything . <sssss> we were the only table seated . <sssss> there were a few people at the bar , in the karaoke room , and on the couches near the front . <sssss> the dining area was basically empty . <sssss> our group of 4 was seated and we received our menus very quickly , but were then ignored for the next 15 minutes as the wait staff meandered around moving tables and repeatedly wiping them off . <sssss> we 're a patient bunch , but not with an empty dining room . <sssss> we all agreed to just get up and leave . <sssss> i doubt we will be coming back . 
1		you know where you are , you 're in the jungle baby , you gon na die ! <sssss> in the jungle , welcome to the jungle watch it bring you to your shun , na , na , na , na , na , na , na , na , knees , knees ! <sssss> because you just might puke after what i 'm about to tell you . <sssss> i went to pita jungle for my first time , i order a diet coke , i took a couple of sips and then noticed that whole inside of the cup was covered in a thick grimy film . <sssss> i though that maybe it was just scratched plastic , i scraped it with my fingernail and it came off ... uuuugggggghhhhhh !!! <sssss> how incredibly nasty !!!! <sssss> i 'm not talking a little bit of residue here folks i 'm talking scum build up from hell !! <sssss> i wish i had n't ordered already . <sssss> i take my glass up to the counter and ask to get a new soda in a to-go cup . <sssss> once i sit back down i start looking around at other peoples cups and notice the same funk caked up inside them as well and they are greedily sipping along without even using a straw . <sssss> . <sssss> eeeeeewwwww so this was not an isolated incident . <sssss> how do you not notice that , please tell me , how do you not feel it touch your lips ... . <sssss> -lrb- shudders -rrb- ... as i sit waiting for my food , dear god , i can only imaging what kind of filth lies behind the counter where no-one can see if this -lrb- cup grime -rrb- is the kind of stuff they are serving up right under our noses . <sssss> i begin to look around and notice that the cups are not the only thing with the foul gunk build up ... . <sssss> the tables too ... oh god i 'm watching a woman let her baby eat right off of the filthy thing ! <sssss> my food arrives , the glazed chicken pizza -lrb- see pics -rrb- ... . <sssss> do i eat ... it looks good ... smells good ... . <sssss> . <sssss> well it actually tasted delicious , unfortunately i could not eat anymore than a couple bites as i was so disgusted with the filth of this place . <sssss> i had to rush right home and shower ! <sssss> 1 star because of the scuzz factor are all pita jungles this repulsive ? <sssss> if not please tell me which one is clean ! <sssss> i will never return to this location 
1		i probably would never return to this market if it were n't closer to me than other asian market in town . <sssss> the evening manager there seem to be very grumpy all the time . <sssss> once my friend asked for some help at the bakery , she was n't greeted at all , and the merchandise was threw at her after she paid . <sssss> the manager was just too angry and unfriendly . <sssss> another friend of mine who needed more assistance due to her disability told me the same manager complained about her being slow to another staff at the customer service in chinese right in front of her not knowing she understood chinese . <sssss> merchandise selection was okay , not very consistent with some of the products . <sssss> you may not be able to find what you bought last time at your next trip . <sssss> might want to stick with mekong or lee lee for friendlier services . 
1		when you walk in the door the color scheme is a lot like jamba juice but they got half way there and stopped . <sssss> so it is left looking less like a healthfood/smoothie place and more like a commercial doctors office . <sssss> you have to ask what is in each smoothie as the ingredients are nowhere to be found . <sssss> i was hoping to see sugar and calorie counts . <sssss> a large smoothie seems half the size of jambas and cost a lot more . <sssss> there is a window where you can see the workers in back all having a good time and barely working on your order and i was told the owner was there ! <sssss> the tropical smoothie i got was so so . <sssss> wont be back . 
1		a group of men went over here to get some beer and wings last night , and a few customers gave them a bad look because obviously there were two gay couples . <sssss> they ordered some food and drinks , but the bartender immediately started being rude to them when asking for their ids . <sssss> they did nothing but want some food and drinks . <sssss> one of them was asked to leave immediately , and the group asked why they needed to leave . <sssss> the bartender just kept getting ruder and ruder . <sssss> eventually the group got up to leave without eating , as the bartender told them they were n't wanted ... he said that native new yorker is a `` straight bar '' and they were n't wanted there ever . 
1		well tonight i gave sonic another chance and it took over 10 minutes to get our order and out of that line . <sssss> to find out that they messed up the order and i do n't get an apology instead i get irritated teenage girl . <sssss> not sure i 'll be visiting anytime soon . <sssss> the great thing is i 'll be a lot healthier if i stay away from this fast food joint . <sssss> and a lot happier without the attitude . 
1		i had been told these guys are like the in-n-out of hot dogs . <sssss> and the hot dogs are good . <sssss> everything else sucks , especially the service . <sssss> the burgers are mediocre at best , the chicken is terrible . <sssss> and if they make a mistake on your order , they will not rectify it . <sssss> they 'll promise you they 'll mail you a gift card , but it will never show up . <sssss> when you check on the status , they 'll tell you they 'll look into it , but again , thy wo n't . <sssss> save yourself some money and get better food and service at in-n-out . 
1		food is ok but more upset that they add 10 percent gratuity to all takeout orders . <sssss> that should be my choice . <sssss> not thrilled ! 
1		here 's to a fitting example of why i often hate being in arizona . <sssss> walk into the westin lobby and turn right . <sssss> there you will find a `` history '' of geronimo that calls him a man who `` struck terror into the hearts of settlers '' . <sssss> nearby is a painting of gallant american soldiers riding horses called `` an apache raid - ride to the rescue '' . <sssss> how lovely to see soldiers on their way to slaughter or deport the local men , women and children . <sssss> a quote from geronimo is nearby where he describes how much he loves the beauty of arizona and wishes more than anything he could be buried there and inspire his people to survive . <sssss> of course he was never able to return . <sssss> arizona would become a territory where the new settlers would boast about surviving in the `` rough '' and `` wild '' . <sssss> there are a few more pictures and write-ups in this area that characterize the federal government as slow and full of excuses , and that make the job of rounding up locals and pushing them into internment camps sound like a noble and justified day 's work -- like pulling out the native weeds to put in asphalt and golf courses . <sssss> meanwhile , downstairs by the meeting rooms , overlooking the nauseating grass hills artificially watered and fertilized to fight back the native beauty of the desert ... there are quotes and photos of the early land developers . <sssss> herberger is quoted saying `` i would rather have land than money anyday '' . <sssss> he bought land that no one else wanted -lrb- too rough and wild -rrb- and said it was a beautiful place . <sssss> no kidding ? <sssss> all that stuff geronimo said was right ? <sssss> too bad you lost 100 years and violated human rights before you found this nugget of wisdom . <sssss> i guess the irony of destroying all the locals and their appreciation of the area and stealing their land is lost on the curators of this homage to genocide . <sssss> maybe that 's why they do n't put the exhibits on the same floor . <sssss> instead they give giant kudos to a department store manager from minnesota who somehow figured out in the 1950s that arizona is pretty enough to develop for football and golf . <sssss> oh , look , a picture of ronald reagan . <sssss> excuse me while i wipe my vomit off the nicotine stained carpet . <sssss> yes , the hotel reeks of smokers . <sssss> even the cushions outside have the unmistakable odor of cancer . <sssss> although i was asked to stay here for a conference , i refused after seeing their sad and lopsided `` view '' of history plastered all over the walls . <sssss> this hotel is a shrine of ignorance that makes settlers look like they were defending themselves as they steamrollered over the native people of this land ... and then they claim that beauty was really discovered by property developers ? <sssss> i want nothing to do with this hotel.there are many other fine places to stay in the area obviously that do not openly celebrate genocide as justified . <sssss> and if i wanted to golf i would go to scotland , not scottsdale . <sssss> one last point . <sssss> the help at the restaurants are beyond clueless . <sssss> it amazes me to watch these kids wander aimlessly among the tables . <sssss> i was surprised when one finally worked up the courage to ask me if i would like to order a drink . <sssss> in three hours of sitting outside my party was only able to order once , we then had to pay as soon as the waiter said his shift ended and he disappeared without bringing us change or a receipt . <sssss> before trying to eat here i would never have believed servers could be this untalented . <sssss> my favorite server to watch was the young woman who hovered and doted on an old man three times her age for half an hour , bringing him drinks and free food , while a half dozen tables were completely neglected nearby . 
1		i am preparing to travel with small dog and need pricing for health certificate . <sssss> i called a few places ... when i called here i was told `` no pricing over the phone '' . <sssss> what ? <sssss> are you kidding ? <sssss> not even for the document ? <sssss> how about price for office visit ? <sssss> no ... she told me no pricing given for anything over the phone . <sssss> i suspect it is on the same lines as a restaurant with no pricing on the menu ... i ca n't afford it . <sssss> this was the only place that could not give me a price for a simple office visit or health certificate . 
1		bolstered by nicole t 's review , we decided to give yangtse a rare third shot . <sssss> oops . <sssss> the rice was still overcooked and gummy , the chicken was still overcooked and dry , the breaded dishes were still over-fried , the beef was still flavorless . <sssss> and those of us who partook became what i will charitably describe as `` ill . '' <sssss> so , hey , we did get something new out of trying it again -- nausea and intestinal distress ! <sssss> three strikes , it 's out , even in spite of good crab puffs and the free fried -lrb- empty -rrb- wontons with their cute little smiley face stamp on the bag . 
1		took the bf for lunch and he insisted on doing the review ... ok so first time at this beautiful looking place very traditional look . <sssss> first thing first ... no hot sauces ... no beans ... no tortillas ... i was served an italian loaf in stead of tortilla chips ... fries which is american with my tacos ... and i could of made more traditional guacamole at home ... sorry barrios cafe . <sssss> you are not a `` best in phoenix mexican restaurant '' 
1		brought my dog in to get anal glands expressed they charged me an extra $ 17 dollars to hold the dog that is on top of the $ 25 dollars they charge for the procedure . <sssss> my dog is the size of a beagle and they are telling me they need 3 people to hold the dog . <sssss> where exactly are these people holding her ? <sssss> should i start charging banfield next time i hold my dog still at her appt ? <sssss> i am one person and i can hold her down by myself . <sssss> it took them a whole 2 minutes to do the procedure they take her in the back room so you ca n't see whats going on . <sssss> next time it would be nice to open the curtains i wan na see that there is extra people being used . <sssss> i wo n't come back to this location . <sssss> the manager rena is useless as well . 
1		i went here with a friend for lunch looking to try something different . <sssss> we knew it would be a bit awkward for us gringos walking into a place that is geared towards asians with foul hanging in the window . <sssss> to be seated we were asked if we were there for lunch or dim sum , we said lunch and were escorted to the cheap seats . <sssss> upon viewing the menu , i realized there were virtually no vegetarian options . <sssss> the only thing i saw was the fried tofu . <sssss> the included egg drop soup was not vegetarian either . <sssss> when my meal finally came , it was not what i expected . <sssss> it was basically nine battered and fried pieces of tofu with rice on the side . <sssss> despite looking quite good , the batter was devoid of any flavor , and the tofu was extremely soft which was not the ideal texture . <sssss> this meal was not too cheap either and i left hungry . <sssss> at least for lunch this is far from being on my list of places to go . <sssss> ps this is not a buffet despite the name 
1		never written a review on yelp and this is my first . <sssss> absolutely the worst experience i 've ever had at an auto establishment . <sssss> i go to the fletchers off lake pleasant and happy valley frequently . <sssss> this is the first time i 've gone to this fletchers . <sssss> i can not express to you strongly enough to stay as far away it from this place as you can . <sssss> rude inconsiderate and unprofessional . 
1		i take my yelp reviews very seriously . <sssss> to me , giving someone a one star yelp review means that they have done something so egregious , that someone either did or could have gotten hurt as a result . <sssss> oh wait ... that 's exactly what happened . <sssss> i recently flew into phoenix with my brother , his husband and their 11 month old baby for a family wedding . <sssss> we rented an suv with a car seat . <sssss> initially , my brother asked if the car seat could be installed for them , as they were unfamililar with this model , and they were told company policy dictates that they could not install the seat . <sssss> fine . <sssss> no big deal . <sssss> we install the seat and off we go to our hotel to rest up for the drive to sedona the next day . <sssss> my brother 's husband had a nagging feeling about the seat that just would n't go away . <sssss> finally , he drove to the local police station to have it inspected and we were informed that hertz had neglected to include the base of the carseat and that it was in fact , unsafe to hold a child . <sssss> a quick call to hertz later and i kid you not , we were informed that it was not negligence on their part , it was negligence on our part for driving off with the car seat that they had provided . <sssss> are you counting ? <sssss> we have two strikes so far . <sssss> massive error that could have led to death of child -lrb- that 's got ta count for at least 10 strikes though ... right -rrb- and then complete failure to take responsibility or attempt to fix the problem . <sssss> the bro in law located a nearby hertz location , and they said we could come and pick up a new seat . <sssss> they gave us a new seat , they sure did . <sssss> once again , i kid you not , this one was missing clips . <sssss> we made our way back to the original hertz location at the airport . <sssss> the staff were rude , and spent a great deal of time rolling their eyes at us when we asked them for assistance putting a strange car seat into a car that we 'd never seen before . <sssss> i understand they ca n't actually install it for liability purposes , but i ca n't believe that no one else has struggled to install an unfamiliar seat in an unfamiliar car . <sssss> regardless , we never once received an apology , just continued rude behavior and eye rolls . <sssss> i travel often and have never encountered such poor customer service and lack of concern for safety at a car rental agency . <sssss> you can be sure that hertz will never receive mine , my family 's or any of my friends ' business again . <sssss> you can bet that they will never receive the business of random people who i run into on the street . <sssss> this is how infuriated i am by their negligience and egregious mishandling of the whole situation . 
1		this place really really sucks ! <sssss> i am so sorry i have signed up for them . <sssss> they dispatched the police department 45 minutes after an alarm went off even though the alarm code was used to deactivate the alarm just because they were not able to reach anyone . <sssss> 45 minutes later ? <sssss> really ?????? <sssss> and in the city of phoenix , that costs $ 99 . <sssss> they refuse to take any responsibility whatsoever . <sssss> they were suppose to send me a faub key which malfunctioned sending a panic alarm to my phone but not to their location . <sssss> it arrived late , it was sent back and now they are claiming they never received it . <sssss> i have filed several complaints with the bbb but seems they pay them good money so the bbb ends out closing the cases and takes the side of the company in doing so . <sssss> this company sucks ! <sssss> stay away from them !!! 
1		this used to be a favorite place of mine . <sssss> the service standards have gone downhill quite a bit . <sssss> one example is i waited 10 minutes for a refill on iced tea , at the bar . <sssss> the food is still outstanding , but i think i will take my hard earned money to sal 's gilbert pizza . <sssss> you have truly let me down pesto 's . 
1		so let me preface this one star with the fact that we never did eat here . <sssss> the reason is because despite the fact that the website says they close at 9:30 on saturday , they actually were closed by 8:00 when we went there ... twice ! <sssss> note to au petit four , this is 2011 and either update your website or inform people if you close early because it is slow . <sssss> we drove from southern scottsdale to arcadia and it was a waste of time . <sssss> also , waste of groupon money !

1		really as bad as it gets . <sssss> crap food . <sssss> over priced . <sssss> ugly , tasteless interior bad music and music system tired staff this place needs to either have a complete redo or it needs to close . <sssss> i would rather go down the street and eat at applebee 's , and i have never been to an applebee 's . <sssss> too many other choices now in the neighborhood for this place to go on in its present condition . <sssss> then again , there might be enough people around these parts with really bad taste to keep the place going . 
1		this place is awful . <sssss> the food takes ridiculously long and the staff is extremely rude , arrogant and condescending . <sssss> i ordered tacos one night , and after all of my friends finished eating their food , i went to bring it to the waitress 's attention that i still had n't gotten my tacos . <sssss> she said `` oh ! <sssss> let me get them , '' saw her grab them from under the heating lamps in the kitchen and then passive aggressively threw them down in front of me . <sssss> after i told her i did n't want them anymore -lrb- since my whole table was already done eating -rrb- , she gave me an attitude and called over the manager , who told me he would take them off my meal . <sssss> then , as i was signing my bill -lrb- giving the waitress a very undeserving tip -rrb- , she proceeded to take a picture of me on her cell phone . <sssss> it was the most unprofessional and humiliating experience . <sssss> no customer should ever be treated this way for justly expecting quality service . <sssss> i will never go to this place again and would n't recommend it to anyone . 
1		i was a walk in , they were not busy at all and they sat me with the new guy in `` training . '' <sssss> not sure why you want to put a walk-in with someone in training , but they did . <sssss> he totally made my nails thick - for a full set with natural nail color , its $ 25 . <sssss> to add gelish on top , it was an additional $ 20 ! <sssss> he never disclosed the upcharge and i paid $ 45 for bumpy and thick nails . <sssss> when i got home , i had to file them down , smooth them out , then add gelish to them again -lrb- since i own gelish at home and know $ 20 is a rip-off ! <sssss> - an entire bottle costs $ 18 -rrb- . <sssss> since the appointment lasted 1 hour and 30 mins and the ladies doing pedicures were obviously noticing the inexperienced man 's flaws , i decided to pay and just leave - i called later to provide feedback and that i will not be returning again although i have been going there on & off for about 4 years now and the manager didnt take my call . <sssss> i told the person on the phone about my experience and she translated to the manager who didnt seem concerned . <sssss> horrible service from inexperienced nail tech - this place has gone down hill over the years and newer salons are worth the slightly added cost . 
1		i ordered the steak wrap bowl from the hidden menu ... it 's so hidden that i 'm still looking for it . <sssss> i get more meat when i get samples at the deli . <sssss> it 's my third bad experience at this place . <sssss> i should have learned by now . 
1		i 'm sorry but this place probably has the worst turkey club i have ever had . <sssss> thick sliced lunchable meat with regular american cheese , bacon , lettuce tomato . <sssss> on a hot toasty bun ... did n't quite sit right , i probably ordered the worst thing on the menu . <sssss> but i was n't to crazy about the potato chunk fried fries either ... but what do i know ! <sssss> the chicken fried steak is probably awesome , but i needed something light and quick at the time ! <sssss> the place was really dirty above your head no telling whats getting on the food that you are about to eat . <sssss> and all the walls were super cluttered with decor , and dusty hats hanging everywhere , kind of gross . <sssss> service was awesome , and the people were cool . <sssss> but not enough to come back to . 
1		i would give zero stars but i am not sure it would post . <sssss> if you like freezing cold food with warm ice tea , you have found it ! <sssss> horrible service , we were greeted with a bowl of broken store bought chips and weak salsa , that was the high point ! <sssss> the waiter forgot to enter our order , when the food finally came it was ice cold . <sssss> the manager picked up the tab , i prefer to have a good meal and pay . <sssss> this was torture . <sssss> the staff is clueless . <sssss> sam fox has jumped the shark . 
1		this was our first time at this restaurant . <sssss> we went later in the evening when the place was almost empty . <sssss> the food was ok . <sssss> nothing to get excited about . <sssss> we were disappointed in how long it took the waiter to get back to us to take our order . <sssss> we had to ask someone to go get him . <sssss> our waiter proceeded to sit down at the table next to us after we received our food and visited the entire time with what it seemed like old family `` friends '' . <sssss> sure he would get up now and then and refill our tea , however , we were unimpressed with this type of service . <sssss> he also had 2 other tables besides ours to wait on . <sssss> we know all about his personal life , when he is finishing up his schooling , etc. . <sssss> i guess we are spoiled by going to other places in town . <sssss> my husband said that with the way the economy is restaurants should be jumping to make sure the customers want to come back and eat at their establishment . <sssss> there are way to many good places to eat . <sssss> thank goodness we used a gift card that i received at christmas . <sssss> i ca n't imagine paying full price for the service we received . <sssss> we were disappointed but it would have been worse if we would have had to pay for the entire meal ourselves . 
1		avoid this macy 's location ! <sssss> was in the dressing room with my wife and daughter just minding our own business when a store employee named leslie came in and interrupted us with a rude condescending voice telling us that men were not allowed in the women 's dressing room . <sssss> normally i 'm fine with any store policy , as long as there is a sign so that i know it 's a womens dressing room ! <sssss> since there was no sign , i figured it would be ok . <sssss> the last thing i need is a rude employee giving us a hard time because of their lack of competence . <sssss> long story short , the wife and i left our items we were going to purchase and walked out of there . <sssss> will not be going back to macy 's . 
1		ok , so the staff at the scottsdale boutique is nice enough . <sssss> not snooty . <sssss> but not very knowldgeable either . <sssss> the problem is , though , with cartier . <sssss> i do n't know how they could screw up a simple engraving on the back of a watch but they did . <sssss> they also did it slowly , over several weeks , well , actually months . <sssss> so after a tank ring , a pavé wedding band and a solitaire , the watch was the last item we bought from cartier . <sssss> it 's not like it 's good value anyway . <sssss> their diamond are ordinary , their watches have eta movements -lrb- most -rrb- . 
1		went there for lunch when my daughter came to town turkey sandwich thats not real turkey beer was flat the patio was dirty staff useless will not go back 
1		horrible service ! <sssss> as soon as we were seated our male server said , `` let me guess , you have a groupon . <sssss> all my tables have groupons tonight & it 's annoying . '' <sssss> hmmm there goes your tip ! <sssss> we called the manager the next day & she did n't seem to care . <sssss> we wo n't be returning ! <sssss> and if you do n't want the groupons , dont offer them ! 
1		well 2nd time i have come to this location . <sssss> 1st time was new year 's eve . <sssss> they were closing early i did n't know that . <sssss> went thru the drive thru waited and then thought ok i will pull up to the window . <sssss> yep see employees and the sign for holiday hours and they were about to close . <sssss> so i guess showing up 10 min before they close means no service they ignored me . <sssss> 2nd time i called . <sssss> showed up ordered just to be told nope out of those all i have are these . <sssss> so needless to say i could n't get dough nut holes at 8pm . <sssss> note to self . <sssss> i wo n't be trying a third time . <sssss> i will drive to the one further away . <sssss> never had a issue at that one . 
1		used to be oggie 's pizza . <sssss> same place , just a little touched up . <sssss> went there for lunch on a saturday afternoon . <sssss> nachos were more of a salad concoction , like a taco salad , with the most bland salsa i 've ever tasted - tasted like thick tomato juice ! <sssss> had a roast beef sandwich , which was toasted and i was never asked if i wanted it toasted , which i would have said no ! <sssss> in fact , it was burnt , i mean black ! <sssss> could n't taste the cheese , was dry as a board , had no sauce , lettuce , tomato , mayo , etc. etc. . <sssss> wife had a antipasto salad with really vinegar-y vegetables , very little lettuce , and a bunch of cold cuts wrapped together with cheese . <sssss> it was hardly a salad . <sssss> i 'd have to say the food was less than mediocre , verging on pretty bad ! <sssss> what 's a bummer is that the pizza joint on mcdowell mountain ranch that changed locations was actually pretty good , and this place simply is n't any good at all . <sssss> blecch ! <sssss> the bar is nice , there 's lot 's of room , space , and plenty of tv 's . <sssss> i might go back here to have a beer & watch a game . <sssss> i 'll never eat here again . 
1		completely let down ! <sssss> looked forward to this event and invited friends and bummed we did . <sssss> too long of lines , parking was a mess , and some booths had you wait in line buy tickets then wait in another line to get your food , which was over priced and small portions . <sssss> so terrible . <sssss> hate all the lines and hate that we had to pay to come into this mess and pay to park . <sssss> a complete joke ! <sssss> take a tip : either twice as many trucks or limit your tickets . <sssss> more alcohol stations and better music . <sssss> scale down prices if you 're going to charge us to get in . 
1		i am giving olive & ivy only 1 star because the employees have no idea how to run a restaurant or deal with customers . <sssss> we went there to celebrate a birthday which did not go too well . <sssss> first when we made the reservation we were told to come in before 3pm on a sunday so we could order from 3 menus well when we arrived , we were told a different story about the menus and told something else by another person and the story kept changing depending on who you spoke with . <sssss> well this restaurant should be closed between 3-5pm on weekends as the only items are flatbreads , a select few salads and apps but no one tells you this when you call . <sssss> so we had planned to order dinner but were told we could not something to do with the kitchen , but we were also told we could not order from the brunch or lunch menu either so we were stuck as to what to order , well it was terrible - the flat breads were terrible , dry and way to salty . <sssss> the bacon burger was not worth $ 12.00 and it was just a real bad time and the manager would not comp anything for all the bad information and did not seem to care we could not find anything good to eat on the menu . <sssss> we had told the waitress we could not handle anything spicy as to let us know if we ordered something which was spicy well do not order the hummus , we were not told it had jalapenos in it even though we asked , they did not take it off the bill even though 5 of the 6 people at the table did not eat it . <sssss> we will not visit again , very bad experience , bad manager , bad customer service . <sssss> not a good fox restaurant , plus the uniforms looked like construction workers . <sssss> the food , was well not worth the money and have had much better elsewhere . 
1		absolute rip off . <sssss> brought in 30 almost new cd 's , many of which i could not find in zia 's store selection the day i went in and most were named artists -lrb- pink , daughtry , nickelback , jimmy buffet ... etc. -rrb- offered me .75 cents -lrb- on average -rrb- per cd , yet were selling the same items for 10 to 15 times the amount offered me . <sssss> i could get better -lrb- and will -rrb- donating the items to charity and taking the tax write off . <sssss> 30 lightly used cd 's and zia 's offered me $ 12 cash or $ 18 credit -lrb- for every 30 used cd 's , i could almost buy 2 used cd 's from zia 's -rrb- . <sssss> turned me off as a buyer thinking how badly zia 's exploited the seller or how badly i was getting doused as a buyer ... knowing what kind of money they were paying sellers for the used cd 's . <sssss> furthermore , zia 's refused to even look at my cd 's to give me a value on the cd 's , unless i provided my personal information for their `` zia 's card '' . <sssss> despite the dyed hair , ink and piercings donned by their employees ... do n't be fooled , zia 's is a completely commercial business working under the worst capitalistic model . <sssss> big thumbs down !!! 
1		reached home with my order and it was the opposite of what i requested . <sssss> called them and they simply told me that i ordered wrong . <sssss> i paid good money for something i could not eat . <sssss> since when is chicken and a bowl full of white rice teryaki lite ... ok , no time to go back - as they were not going to make it right anyway . <sssss> tried to eat it ... chicken was dry as cardboard , and rice was a sticky mess . <sssss> never again . <sssss> save your money . 
1		i have been going to all american eyeglass repair for several years . <sssss> i always change out nose pads on my sunglasses to silicone nonslip pads . <sssss> they cost around $ 30 depending on type of frames . <sssss> they normally have friendly and knowledgeable staffs there and never had any problems before . <sssss> i even recommended to friends and co-workers . <sssss> last time i was there , there was this crazy old witch there and she was so rude and made a big deal about adjusting my glasses . <sssss> she said she had to charge me $ 15 to adjust my sunglasses because they were n't purchased there . <sssss> what ?!?! <sssss> i 've been taking all of my glasses there for repairs and never had any problems with free fitting . <sssss> when they replaced the nose pads , the staff always adjust to make sure they fit properly . <sssss> the guy that worked on my glasses told me to wear for a day and see how they fit and bring back for readjustment if needed . <sssss> this crazy lady -lrb- i believe she 's the owner -rrb- tried to charge me a fee . <sssss> i had to argue with her till she finally agree to adjust at no charge . <sssss> she was freakin nuts ! <sssss> every eyeglass place i 've ever been always adjust at no charge even though i did not purchase them there . <sssss> i will not give them any more business and will not be going back . 
1		sooo greasy ... all of our dishes tasted the same and were dripping in grease . <sssss> we will not be back to this joint ! 
1		updated 8/3/2013 . <sssss> a couple weeks ago , i wrote the updated review below wherein i was contacted by the manager of mastro 's ocean club . <sssss> he said he would either take our three entrees off our tab or send us a gift certificate -lrb- for the price of the three entrees -rrb- . <sssss> i asked him which would be easier for him and he said the gift certificate . <sssss> i got the gift certificate last week ... it was for $ 100 ... not even close to covering the cost of our entrees . <sssss> my lobster , for example was $ 70 ... that would mean the other two entrees totaled would have had to have been $ 30 and we all know that the scallops and the bone-in ribeye would be more than $ 30 each . <sssss> i am really upset . <sssss> i wish i would have told the manager to have the price of the entrees removed from our bill even though it would have taken him longer to do it . <sssss> believe me , we wo n't be using the gift certificate anytime soon , as we are very disappointed in this whole matter . <sssss> and if the manager is reading this and wondering why i did n't call him ... it 's like this . <sssss> you did n't comp us for the price of our entrees like you said you would , and if you ca n't abide by your word , why should i bother calling ? <sssss> i 'm sure you 'll just have some flimsy excuse why you did what you did . <sssss> i 'm thoroughly disgusted with mastro 's ocean club ... no longer a fan . <sssss> ***** the other day after i posted my review on mastro 's ocean club , i was contacted by their parent corporation asking me to complete a survey and note my remarks . <sssss> yesterday , the manager of ocean club called me to discuss my remarks . <sssss> he was very pleasant and we discussed at some length the issues i had described . <sssss> he provided a very nice resolution to the whole ordeal which i thought was very nice . <sssss> needless to say , i 'll be giving ocean club another chance and look forward to making the acquaintance of the manager . <sssss> one other positive note : after enjoying the blufeld reisling on my visit to the restaurant , i have been able to find the wine in the valley . <sssss> after a discussion with aj 's , they explained to me the differences in the reidl stemware created for various wines and i now have four beautiful pieces of stemware to compliment my blufeld . <sssss> next time i will remember to note the name of my waiter , so i can give him the praise he so richly deserves for recommending this wine . 
1		bad service and food could be good if they actually included all the ingredients . <sssss> . <sssss> from what i have heard the mac n cheese burrito is the only thing worth eating here . <sssss> we had the carne asada burrito and the casa chicken . <sssss> the carne asada burrito is just chopped beef with taco seasoning you buy from walmart and that 's about it , maybe it could be better if all the ingredients were in it . <sssss> the casa chicken was again missing ingredients but much better than the burrito . <sssss> this is my personal experience try whatever you want maybe you will have better luck . <sssss> : -rrb- 
1		this place is the worst ! <sssss> first of all , the person taking my order was so awkward it made me feel uncomfortable . <sssss> next i ordered the wednesday special which is rolled beef tacos -lrb- beef or chicken , your choice -rrb- with rice and beans for $ 4.99 and i asked to substitute the rice and beans for chips . <sssss> when my order came , they forgot the chips which is n't a big deal i just went back up to the register and asked for some . <sssss> then as i started to eat , i noticed they gave me chicken instead of beef . <sssss> i was kind of disappointed but i had class soon and did n't want to wait for them to make another order so i got over it . <sssss> then as i was eating i choked on a chicken bone ! <sssss> it was horrible !! <sssss> a chicken bone in a rolled taco ?! <sssss> i was so mad , i left . <sssss> never going there again ! <sssss> stay away ! 
1		went here with some coworkers for lunch . <sssss> was not impressed with the pizza at all . <sssss> the garlic bread tasted store bought . <sssss> will not return . 
1		the worst dining experience i have ever had . <sssss> the frozen margarita had large chunks of ice . <sssss> we had to ask twice for the appetizer and our entrees when delivered an hour later were inedible . <sssss> we have groupons and livingsocial which we will let lapse because you could n't pay me to eat there again . <sssss> this form requires i give at least one star ; however my true rating would be zero . 
1		check list : dirty floors , sticky cheap sliver ware , sticky menus , bad server , tasteless `` mexican '' food . <sssss> just to name a few ! <sssss> guess you can make a living selling food to allwhitetukee that makes taco bell look like a five star restaurant ! <sssss> pluses : atmosphere , chips , & ice . <sssss> only good things in this place . 
1		i 'm pretty angry ... i was slightly ticked after our visit last night and fully intended to give maggiano 's a 2 star update . <sssss> but within the last 5 minutes i went from annoyed to pissed . <sssss> let me start from the beginning ... after a very rough saturday with a beloved member of our family in the hospital , we were craving some comfort food , and we were in no mood to cook . <sssss> we had a great experience at maggiano 's last time and we thought the extra meal they provide when you order a classic entree would be perfect the next day , since we knew we would be busy and emotionally drained . <sssss> we get there and hear there is an hour wait . <sssss> luckily we snagged a bar table and did n't have to wait . <sssss> we order the overpriced drinks . <sssss> they take 10 minutes to arrive . <sssss> my cocktail is pretty watered down . <sssss> okay . <sssss> we understand busy restaurants . <sssss> not mad ... yet . <sssss> we order our food . <sssss> the complimentary bread still has n't arrived . <sssss> i thought my starving husband and kid were going to pass out . <sssss> 20 minutes pass . <sssss> no server . <sssss> 40 minutes pass . <sssss> our server approaches `` oh , would you like some bread while you wait ? '' <sssss> why , yes . <sssss> yes we would . <sssss> another 10 minutes pass . <sssss> we get our bread . <sssss> our cold , stale tasting bread . <sssss> luckily olive oil can save even stale bread . <sssss> my famished teenager ate most of it . <sssss> my husband and i both order another round . <sssss> another 20 minutes pass . <sssss> i got my wine but my husband never got his beer . <sssss> a food runner brings out our food . <sssss> no offered parmesan or anything . <sssss> my husband looks around longingly for his beer . <sssss> we dig into the food . <sssss> my normally not picky teenage boy said `` there 's something strange about this food . <sssss> ca n't put my finger on it '' . <sssss> he still ate most of it of course . <sssss> my husband 's rigatoni was passable . <sssss> my eggplant parmesan on the other hand ... while i appreciate it being hand breaded and not like the formerly frozen discs that the olive garden serves , i was disappointed . <sssss> there were three layers of eggplant . <sssss> while the bottom 2 layers were warm , the top layer was room temperature . <sssss> the breading itself was salty and very eggy . <sssss> it tasted like the first time i attempted making eggplant parmesan as a college student . <sssss> the one slice of mozzarella on top of this mess was not even melted . <sssss> it had the texture of sliced processed cheese . <sssss> the sauce was not good ... you know all that garlic that i loved in my previous review ? <sssss> well , it was still there . <sssss> but it tasted like stale garlic cloves that were barely cooked . <sssss> it 's like they threw in these awful garlic cloves 5 minutes before the sauce was done cooking . <sssss> they were actually chewy . <sssss> we finally saw our server when she rushed over and threw our to-go entrees at us . <sssss> still did n't bring the beer . <sssss> a few more minutes pass and she brings the beer and apologizes for her 20 minute delay . <sssss> my husband said no thanks , that he does n't want it . <sssss> she says ok , walks away , then has the good sense to walk back and give it to him saying it 's on her . <sssss> but do n't feel too sorry for us ... the table next to us was seated before we were . <sssss> they got their food a solid 15 minutes after we did . <sssss> i was n't ready to throw in the towel on maggiano 's . <sssss> i just figured they had a bad night . <sssss> after all , my previous visit was so awesome . <sssss> well ... after another grueling and emotional day i finally decide to put some food in my belly . <sssss> wow , that order of cheese raviolis from maggiano 's sounds pretty good right now . <sssss> i reach into their fancy to-go paper bag and pull out the entrees . <sssss> 2 meat lasagnas . <sssss> one sausage rigatoni . <sssss> zero cheese raviolis . <sssss> i really am ready to call them and scream at them ... but it 's after 10pm on a sunday . <sssss> if i were n't a life long vegetarian i would be tearing into those other entrees . <sssss> but i 'm not . <sssss> which is why i ordered cheese ravioli . <sssss> no worries . <sssss> i scanned my near empty refrigerator and pantry . <sssss> found some ramen noodles and frozen costco raviolis . <sssss> score ! <sssss> i 'm sure the costco ravioli tastes better than their crappy ravioli any day . <sssss> : -lrb- 
1		do n't expect us airways to actually deliver services that you 've paid for . <sssss> they can completely fail to deliver due to their own problems , ruin your vacation and cause you to spend money without regard or refund . <sssss> can you imagine any other business where they can take your money in advance , then make you wait for hours before not telling you that they are n't going to deliver at all , then refuse to refund ? <sssss> it 's an outrageous scam ! <sssss> our first problem was that their flight 2834 did not arrive at burbank from phoenix to take us from burbank to phoenix to connect us with our flight 305 to charlotte , which made it an emergency to book with southwest to make the connection at a cost of $ 189.70 x 2 for the total of $ 379.40 then they had another three hour delay for the same trip on the way home . <sssss> they should be legally required to refund services not rendered at least . <sssss> then we had to suffer through arrogant and unhelpful customer service only to find out they would only give us credit for $ 25 in total for two passengers . <sssss> think about the risks before opting for a slightly cheaper fair . 
1		staff sucks ignored our needs , seem to try and forget we were there . <sssss> food really sucked cold just tasted like jail food . <sssss> so do yourself a favor do n't come here read the reviews 
1		everything was so bland . <sssss> it tasted like nothing . 
1		the most terrible service ever , all night long . <sssss> over and over we were disrespected ! <sssss> i 've literally never been any where , where they were so rude . <sssss> go some where else ! <sssss> do n't come here ! 
1		we were craving chinese and sushi so we decided to go to here at 8:45 pm . <sssss> bad idea . <sssss> there was no sushi left . <sssss> the cook and the manager were standing by the bar so i asked them if they had any left . <sssss> they said something in chinese and pointed to what i believe was the server . <sssss> i found out they close at 9:30 pm . <sssss> what was left was very little options and very picked by the other customers . <sssss> there were little spoonfuls of food left and what was left was cold . <sssss> they did bring me white rice when i found out they were out of it . <sssss> the fried shrimp was greasy . <sssss> many food options were gone and the hot plates were already cleaned out . <sssss> before paying my $ 27.36 i told the cashier to please relay to the management i was dissappointed there was no sushi and that the food that was remaining was cold . <sssss> she did not seem to care . <sssss> i see that this lesson to not return cost me $ 27.36 . <sssss> its a shame too because i live around the corner from here . <sssss> i guess i will just make the drive to krazy buffet the next time . <sssss> do n't waste your time here . <sssss> this was a chinese food place but there was nothing super about this buffet . <sssss> i am net to yelp and i never complain but this experience was bad enough that i had to voice my opinion . <sssss> i see from the thread that other people had visited this same restaurant on power road in the evening and had a similiar bad ex -lsb- erience with the food . <sssss> from now on , i am going to use yelp more ! 
1		first time here in a few years and very disappointed . <sssss> i saw it was all you can eat fish & chips which sounded perfect , but in over an hour the waitress came back one with only 1 piece of fish . <sssss> i would have loved to have more but did n't want to wait another hour . <sssss> great place if you are n't hungry or thirsty and do n't mind killing a few hours just sitting around i guess . 
1		this location seems to be cursed ! <sssss> before it was kozy cactus , it was a voodo daddy 's magic kitchen & bar . <sssss> i did n't dare go near that establishment and now i wonder if a spell was cast on the next business to take its place , because it 's a little off . <sssss> the restaurant is truly cozy . <sssss> there are tv 's everywhere , which is nice . <sssss> when the place is full on a friday night , it 's loud and hard to hear one another . <sssss> but it 's not as bad as places on mill avenue in that way . <sssss> handicapped access is in the back at the door that says , `` please use the other door '' . <sssss> it 's ok , that 's the right door to use and your only option , as they padlock the front gate . <sssss> however , if you 're in a power chair , do n't expect to use the bathroom . <sssss> your chair wo n't fit . <sssss> this is why i 've marked this restaurant as `` not wheelchair accessible '' . <sssss> it 's not really the ambiance or the staff that has thrown my review down to a `` one star '' . <sssss> it 's the actual menu : the food and drink selection and quality are pitiful and over priced . <sssss> my first meal at kozy cactus was when they first opened . <sssss> i got the crab louie salad for lunch . <sssss> it was really bad . <sssss> i thought i might have tasted dish soap . <sssss> my second meal at kozy cactus started out with the pan sautéed calamari . <sssss> it was over chewy , maybe over cooked ? <sssss> maybe reheated poorly , as i 'm sure it was frozen , not fresh . <sssss> the tomato sauce was good but the bread was straight from an old loaf probably purchased at the grocery store . <sssss> this dish made me crave chef boyardee , it was that bad . <sssss> since i could n't eat much more of it , i asked for a large order of regular fries to split with my friend who also suffered through the calamari . <sssss> we inhaled the `` regular '' fries . <sssss> they were good . <sssss> my other amiga ordered the `` pub nachos '' . <sssss> the description on the menu says `` thick sliced russet potato chips '' . <sssss> ignore the word `` chips '' . <sssss> the dish was n't what she expected . <sssss> it was thick slices of potato with a bit of cheese on top and some sauteed onions . <sssss> this would n't be called a chip in england , let alone in arizona where we all understand what a nacho is . <sssss> my two other dinner compadres stuck to plain old regular tortilla chips and salsa to go with their beers and scotch . <sssss> they got a small serving of chips and only one refill which took a while to arrive . <sssss> the variety of drinks is supremely limited . <sssss> the margaritas are weak but i like them that way . <sssss> ultimately , there are a few kinds of beer -lrb- not many dark options -rrb- and a few kinds of scotch and the rest is at your own risk . <sssss> this a very basic place to both eat and drink . <sssss> too basic . <sssss> they do n't accept credit cards unless you order over $ 10 , which is odd . <sssss> bottom line : there are better pubs with better grub up the street . 
1		this was our second stop on our mekong food crawl . <sssss> . <sssss> after waiting for about 15 minutes with one person ahead of us we finally placed our order . <sssss> i cant tell you how close we were to walking out and just going across the street to ace . <sssss> . <sssss> well we persevered . <sssss> . <sssss> here is why the food takes so long to come out . <sssss> . <sssss> they que the orders up and try to make all like dishes at the same time , no matter how long youve been there . <sssss> . <sssss> if you ordered peddler soup and 4 tables behind you ordered peddler soup , you will be waiting until they get to that dish on the ticket . <sssss> . <sssss> its bullshit ! <sssss> anyway , one order came out , was the pork chop and rice box . <sssss> . <sssss> while the pork chop looked good it was pretty lame . <sssss> tea egg was fine but it was just a tea egg . <sssss> . <sssss> the cabbage salad was warm and pretty boring . <sssss> after about 15 minutes the other 2 dishes arrived . <sssss> . <sssss> the beef stew over rice was prepared in this overly thick gelatinous goo . <sssss> . <sssss> while the meat texture was good the overall flavor and appearance was pretty nasty . <sssss> the other dish , chicken in chiles was pretty ordinary and was n't spicy at all . <sssss> kinf of surprising since the dish was covered in chiles . <sssss> . <sssss> though i think they may have been old . <sssss> even the boba thai tea was thin , watered down and not very good . <sssss> was so not worth the wait ! <sssss> after a few bites of each we ended up leaving and went across the street to ace for some decent asian food . <sssss> . <sssss> what a complete waste of time . 
1		awful !!! <sssss> why am i waiting 20 minutes for a bagel ! <sssss> everyone should cross the 101 and got to big city bagels !! <sssss> they have friendly , fast service . <sssss> support local business owners ! <sssss> einstein 's made me wait 20 minutes and then they gave me the wrong bagel !!! <sssss> i blame the owner !!!! 
1		i am not impressed . <sssss> i got the mushroom burger and i guess i should have assumed the `` smash '' part meant that they would squish the patty ... but that takes most of the flavor out ! <sssss> o i was excited for fried pickles but they were really greasy and gross ! <sssss> also it was damn cold in there ... i 'll stick with 5 guys 
1		i 'm not even sure where to begin with this . <sssss> we showed up right at the start of dinner and food from lunch was still out and they were slowly putting out dinner food . <sssss> the sushi ? <sssss> yuck . <sssss> it tasted like what you get from the grocery store deli . <sssss> we saw peel and eat shrimp ... yay ! <sssss> gross . <sssss> how can you mess that up ?! <sssss> the lo mein was really good but i did n't find much up there where i can actually say `` wow ! <sssss> this is really good ! '' <sssss> another thing ... i have a lot of food allergies and they did n't have a lot of their items labeled . <sssss> with all this being said , i would say that for the price it 's worth it just for the crab alone . 
1		this lunch visit came from a suggestion from my boyfriend who claims the portion sizes are a great deal for the money - which is true . <sssss> however , the less of this subpar food the better . <sssss> i had the hunan special chicken and my boyfriend had the general tso chicken . <sssss> i 'm more of a fan of white meat than dark meat , and most of the chicken that was visible through the fried fat and skin was dark . <sssss> the staff was friendly enough but the place was dirty -lrb- food on the walls -rrb- and the parking lot is a joke . <sssss> if you are in the mood for chinese food , do yourself a favor and pass up this place . 
1		took my fiancé here as she loves sushi -- i do n't enjoy it , but you have to bend sometimes . <sssss> i did n't eat the sushi , but let 's just say she left a third of the plate there . <sssss> i ordered chicken and shrimp w / white rice and vegetables . <sssss> i did n't know five ounces of oil came with my food -- i ended up using the rice to soak the oil from the food . <sssss> my fiancé and i are having real stomach discomfort and have n't felt well since about two hours after we ate ... i think it was the oil for me , but her issues are worse then mine and it 's been a rough evening for her . <sssss> beware -- if you eat oil by the spoonful you 'll be good ... just hope my fiancé feels better . 
1		first time i 've ever felt like a leper in a restaurant . <sssss> i come to scottsdale for business once a month . <sssss> i was staying at the hyatt place across the parking lot and decided to go at about 7:00 on a thursday to grab dinner on my own . <sssss> when i got to the restaurant , the front part was empty , but the other side of the bar had people at some tables and at the bar . <sssss> i was told by someone when i walked in , to sit anywhere i liked . <sssss> so i looked around , and since i did n't want to sit at the bar , i picked one of the three open 4-top tables available as there were no 2-tops open . <sssss> and then i sat . <sssss> about 8 minutes later , after watching the waitresses walk past me a number of times , one actually stopped , and then proceeded to ask if i would move to the bar . <sssss> she said that she had larger groups that would want the table . <sssss> there was no one waiting for tables , but she explained to me that a dj would be starting in 10 minutes and it would get crowded . <sssss> `` lucky '' for me , the two-top next to me was getting ready to leave , so she said i could wait and just move to that table . <sssss> in the meantime she did ask me if i wanted a drink . <sssss> i asked about their bourbon selection , but it was non-existent , so i ordered a beer . <sssss> she brought me a beer , and then cleaned the table next to me so i moved . <sssss> she then disappeared for five minutes before bringing me a menu . <sssss> once she brought me the menu , it was another 10 minutes of waiting . <sssss> i saw my waitress standing at the bar texting on her phone , while the other waitress walked passed me four times . <sssss> my waitress finally came back and took my order . <sssss> the food was very good . <sssss> no dj ever came on , and half way through my meal , she sat two people at the four-top table next to me that she asked me to vacate . <sssss> no on ever asked how my food was . <sssss> when i was finished , i sat there for a few minutes , and then one waitress took my empty plate and the other brought me a check . <sssss> i never asked for the check , i actually thought i might have another beer , but since it was obvious they were n't going to offer and just did n't seem to want me there , i paid and left . <sssss> just to be clear , i was wearing a relatively expensive suit , looked very professional and find it hard to believe i was `` undesirable . '' <sssss> for some reason i was . <sssss> i will never return to this restaurant . <sssss> i prefer to go someplace where i am made to feel comfortable , welcome and wanted . <sssss> it was very disappointing . 
1		i quit going there , my manager did not . <sssss> he came back from jj 's , looked in his bag and started shaking his head . <sssss> he had asked for mustard and mayonnaise packets . <sssss> guess what was n't in the bag ? <sssss> `` they ca n't get anything right . <sssss> it was a simply request . <sssss> you 'd think with 20 people working back there they might get something right '' . <sssss> i no longer patronize this establishment , they have proven beyond any measure of doubt that their employees could care less about whether they get your order right or not . 
1		this was very possibly the worst dining experience i have ever had . <sssss> like everyone else we bought the groupon thinking we struck gold with a $ 10 buffet for two . <sssss> especially mediterranean which normally has a great selection of vegetarian food for me and lots of meat for my boyfriend . <sssss> we walked in and could instantly hear construction on the other side which was a huge turn off and it 's not that the decor was tacky but it was unfinished and had that gross feeling of not wanting to touch anything . <sssss> i do n't know why they thought this was the perfect time to trick everyone into dining here with a groupon when they were still trying to get the place together . <sssss> at least take down the fuji buffet signs !! <sssss> the girl who greeted us immediately stated they were having plumbing propblems and did not have fountain water and asked if bottled water was ok and that it would be no extra charge . <sssss> i 'm still a little confused how they were able to have fountain soda if they were having plumbing problems and unable to serve water . <sssss> from a distance you 'd think `` wow , they have a great selection of food '' but then you get closer and quickly realize it 's far from impressive . <sssss> since it 's a buffet and of course i wanted to get my money 's worth , i filled up my plate but low and behold everything was cold . <sssss> i do n't mean a couple things were n't as hot as they should be but actually cold . <sssss> they brought pita bread that was burnt and left an awful taste in my mouth . <sssss> knowing there was nothing on the buffet i could eat i settled for watermelon which was not fresh , it was definitely last weeks produce . <sssss> the owner gave me snide looks when she cleared our plates , i actually regret not explaining to her why i could n't eat anything on my plate . <sssss> but , honestly how could she not know ? <sssss> when the girl came back over we asked if we could just get our check for the coke he ordered , she went and asked and was told $ 4.00 . <sssss> seriously ??? <sssss> you 're charging me $ 2.00 for a 35 cent bottle of water that i had to drink because you had plumbing problems and could n't give me tap water ? <sssss> i 'm not trying to be cheap but i do n't drink soda . <sssss> we gave her exactly $ 4.00 and she handed it to the owner who again gave me dirty looks . <sssss> i still left a tip but only because i 'm a former server and not to commend a job well done . <sssss> i plan on contacting the health department today to inform them of this place serving food that 's not at the right temperature . <sssss> i can only imagine what 's really going on in that kitchen !!! <sssss> my advice to everyone is to not walk foot in here . <sssss> if you bought a groupon , just chalk it up to $ 10 down the drain and do n't even bother !! 
1		i come here because it 's the closest spot to my house . <sssss> the staff is awful , but the men who work there are much easier to deal with than the women . <sssss> any time i have dealt with a female , i 've walked out without finishing what i came to do . <sssss> they are so unhelpful and rude ! <sssss> i walked in to pay a bill and only had $ 100.00 bill on me . <sssss> th lady who greeted me tried to send me to the kiosks and i told her , no i want to talk to a human . <sssss> then she said `` i do n't have change , but you can go to chili 's and get change '' at that point she was lucky i did n't slap her . <sssss> basically she was tellin me no one paid with cash that day ? <sssss> i call bullshit . <sssss> had she been nicer i would n't be yelping my horrible experience but she got all snarky the minute i did n't want to use to kiosks . <sssss> i guess doing a job you get paid to is too hard to manage . <sssss> i did n't get her name but i will be getting it ! <sssss> you would think that since verizon is the most expensive service , they would have better representatives , but they have like the worst customer service which is just not worth renewing my contract for . 
1		do not do business with suncoast security or adt !!! <sssss> even though suncoast is an authorized dealer , adt does n't care about the work ethic they have or their customers through this authorized dealer !!!!! <sssss> when i had my system installed , the installer did n't show up the first time . <sssss> they called me to make sure everything went smoothly and when i told him that no one ever came , they gave me a month free and sent the installer out again . <sssss> when the installer came out he complained about how long his drive was and it was n't worth it !!! <sssss> then he did n't put sensors on 4 windows downstairs including my sliding glass door !!!! <sssss> he said he would have to come back with those sensors because he was told not to bring any !!! <sssss> my house was already set up ... but i was promised 8 free sensors on top of what was already in my house !! <sssss> well ... i never heard back from anyone in the suncoast security family ... and when i called them ... no answer !!! <sssss> i called adt who said they could n't do anything about it but let adt corporate know what was going on . <sssss> that was 4 months ago ... suncoast security was given authorization to electronically pull out my monthly charge from my bank account . <sssss> well guess who cancelled my account and sending me to collections because of non payment !!!! <sssss> i have bank statements backing up that i have made my monthly payments through electronic withdrawl on their behalf !! <sssss> adt does n't want to help me in any way because they are not the owners of the contract ... even though suncoast security clearly states on their website that adt will give you your money back for any instllation or monthly billing if you are not satisfied with their service within the first 6 months !!! <sssss> guess who does n't care about their customers ? <sssss> adt or suncoast security ... do not do business with them ... use time warner instead for your security needs !!!!! <sssss> i am now and could n't be happier . 
1		service was good , food was sub par . <sssss> i would n't recommend . <sssss> everything was very bland . 
1		this is my second visit to this store . <sssss> kimberly -lrb- the woman behind the counter -rrb- is the rudest person i have ever met in retail , who does not deserve to be behind the counter of any retail counter . <sssss> she is cold , un-inviting , and overall appears to hate her job by the scour look on her face . <sssss> she is useless when it comes to helping customers and overall she has a `` ca n't do '' attitude . <sssss> i lodged a complaint on the corporate website and this store is privately franchised and owned . <sssss> i spoke with john the owner and apparently he must have trained kimberly because his attitude is just as bad if not worse . <sssss> he did n't show any concern for my complaint nor did he show any empathy for my experience . <sssss> he hung up on me twice in conversation . <sssss> kimberly followed me out to the parking lot and show aggressive signs of intimidation with my friend and i and in my opinion that was inappropriate and unprofessional . <sssss> a sales person never follows a customer outside . <sssss> avoid this store at all cost . <sssss> the post office is around the corner and is much cheaper . <sssss> i am fling a complaint with the better business bureau . <sssss> good luck john and kimberly !!! 
1		just moved into the area and have stopped here twice for quick meal . <sssss> both times i ordered a mexican pizza and 2 tacos . <sssss> the shells seemed stale and the food was just tossed together and it looked like there was anything on the pizza . <sssss> nothing like all my other experiences at other taco bells . <sssss> not likely to come to see if the 3rd times the charm 
1		i am an avid reader and spend quite a bit of money weekly at barnes and noble , both online and at the local store . <sssss> this evening , i escorted my mother to this store so that she could buy a book for my niece , and while there i found a book myself . <sssss> my mother is disabled , and i went to checkout for her . <sssss> i was buying two books , separately , with two different payment methods -lrb- one mine , one my mothers -rrb- . <sssss> my mother was waiting near by and it was obvious that we were together . <sssss> when i went to check out , i told the salesperson that i was checking these items out separately , and that we both had a coupon . <sssss> the coupons both had the same code number -lrb- which as i verified with another salesperson after the fact , every copy of this coupon has the same number -rrb- . <sssss> this salesperson , steven , refused to check me out . <sssss> he told me that it did n't matter that i was checking out for two separate people , using separate pay methods , or that we each had coupons sent to directly to us . <sssss> he said that the code could only be used one time , and would only let me purchase one item . <sssss> he was incredibly rude in the way that he spoke to me , and i will not go back to this store for this very reason . <sssss> this is the only store that is convenient to my location , which means that my money will now be spent at an independent seller instead of at your store . <sssss> as i walked away , and went to find someone else to help me complete my purchase , he called the manager -lrb- in front of my mother -rrb- and told him that i was coming to complain about him and that i was angry because he would n't let me check out multiple items using the same coupon , that was not the scenario as he well knew , and the manager -lrb- only a few feet away and also within ear shot of my mother -rrb- then stated that he would back him up should i complain ; which effectively negated my ability to resolve this issue in store . <sssss> if this is how customers are allowed to be treated , then i will not be going back . <sssss> i have been treated rudely by salespeople before , but never as blatantly as by steven at the tempe , az tempe marketplace store . 
1		do not shop here . <sssss> a simple question ends with the sales clerk chasing you and your family into the parking lot screaming at you . <sssss> this morning my parents , boyfriend and i were shopping local businesses in the melrose district . <sssss> i thought some of the items were a little pricey . <sssss> i asked a salesperson , -lrb- who may have been the owner -rrb- if he would `` take 10 dollars '' for a plaque with a funny saying . <sssss> he replied in a terse voice `` we do n't haggle here . <sssss> we are firm but fair '' i said `` it was just a question '' the sales clerk replies `` you got your whole paycheck last week did n't you ? <sssss> we want our whole paycheck here too '' . <sssss> i then say to my parents that i did n't need to be talked to like that and we should we leave . <sssss> i said to the clerk `` it was just a question . '' <sssss> the clerk than says `` capital f to you . '' <sssss> i take this as him saying to `` f *** you '' to me , and say it back . <sssss> i leave the store and he then yells at my 63 year old mother -lrb- who walks with a cane -rrb- `` your daughter needs to be educated '' . <sssss> as she is leaving the store the clerk follows us out to the parking lot shouting at us that `` capital f means figs and home and garden '' . <sssss> he also accosts my boyfriend by saying that `` they did n't bargain there and how dare we presume that the place was a flea market . '' <sssss> i have never been chased into a parking lot by a clerk screaming at my family and me . <sssss> this man -lrb- perhaps the owner -rrb- was rude and threatening . <sssss> i like to support local businesses , but this man 's behavior was appalling . <sssss> do not shop here . 
1		mido came to me highly recommended by some friends of ours . <sssss> by the end of the night he was apologizing to me , when it should have been the restaurant staff . <sssss> our evening started smoothly enough , we had a party of 10 and they seated us promptly which was good . <sssss> the waitress who came around the first time did n't understand my drink order the first time i gave it , so i repeated it and there was no further issue . <sssss> then came time order sushi , our party was doing the all-you-can-eat deal , so we asked for separate ordering slips so we could keep the tickets separate . <sssss> the waitress did not understand what we were describing to her and became flustered and panicked -lrb- english was not her first language -rrb- because they apparently keep everything on one ticket typically . <sssss> which would normally be fine , but i needed to make sure my own orders were clearly segregated because i have an avocado allergy . <sssss> so the lady summoned another waiter to us and i had to explain that we wanted to keep the tickets separate and why , it was no big deal . <sssss> we ordered sushi , and for my two sons we ordered chicken dishes off the normal dinner menu . <sssss> while we waited , a sweaty glass was fumbled by a combination effort of the waiter and my eldest son trying to rescue it . <sssss> nevertheless , broken glass and ice water covered my boy and our table . <sssss> waiter came back with towels to clean up , it was n't really clear that it was anyone 's fault , just frustrating . <sssss> then our orders began to arrive . <sssss> our entire table of 10 got all of their sushi , but my boys ' dinners were missing . <sssss> my younger son is 3 . <sssss> we were n't about to eat in front of him . <sssss> half an hour goes by and we do n't have any staff visit our table ... for drinks , to check on us , or anything . <sssss> i flag down a girl who was n't our waitress and try to discreetly tell her we were still waiting for two dishes for my sons . <sssss> the waiter came back a moment later and said he was sorry and that he forgot them and they 'd be out in a few minutes . <sssss> i was without words . <sssss> when their dinners finally arrived , my sushi had been sitting on our table for 40 minutes , and was considerably closer to room temperature than i would have liked , but i made my own decision not to eat while my children waited . <sssss> the food was pretty good , not the best by a longshot , and some of their rolls are made in ways inconsistent with dozens of other sushi restaurants that i have frequented in the past . <sssss> if this review were solely for the food , i would say 3.5-ish stars . <sssss> our second order of ayce sushi takes a little bit long , but by this time the restaurant is crowded , and i can literally see how fast and frantic the sushi chefs are working , so i do n't cause a fuss . <sssss> when the last order finally arrives , we sit and chat for another 15-20 minutes or so while no staff visit our table , we flag someone down and request the bill . <sssss> then , gold strikes and some other woman who we had n't seen yet before comes to our table with a notepad , asking every person what they ordered before we could get the bills for our party . <sssss> i bit my tongue and complied and rattled off everything i ordered , not mentioning the unacceptable delays for my childrens ' dinners as i was confident someone had brought it to their attention already . <sssss> but the question remained ; why were we telling them what we ordered ? <sssss> it was n't `` ok who had the philly roll , ok and who had the sake bomber ... ? '' <sssss> etc , it was `` what did you have ? '' <sssss> as if she had no idea and nobody wrote anything down from our original order or that the tickets that we deliberately asked them to separate so they could , you know , make this part easier for themselves , had disappeared . <sssss> then came the bill . <sssss> full price charged for the order , even the late forgotten meals , plus 18 % gratuity added on . <sssss> i walked straight to the cashier , pointed at the gratuity and said three words clearly and softly . <sssss> `` remove . <sssss> this . <sssss> please . '' <sssss> i gave him my card , signed , and left . <sssss> i am beyond pissed and i am not going to return . <sssss> tl ; dr : - first waitress had a panic attack over keeping my no-avocado allergy order segregated from others - glass of water broken onto our table and my sons . <sssss> - forgot my kids ' orders-were 40 minutes late to our table . <sssss> - wait staff visits to our table infrequent , often had to ask for other passers-by for assistance - completely clueless about what our table ordered . <sssss> we had to tell them everything we ordered as if the original order tickets were lost - 18 % auto-tip added on when it not only should n't have been , but i should not have been charged for my kids dishes after having to wait to eat . <sssss> - never going back . <sssss> this is not a 4-star establishment . 
1		i booked a suite for a conference . <sssss> they tried to put me in a small room , which was 1/3 the area of the suite i paid for . <sssss> and told me that it was more expensive than the king suite . <sssss> they insulted my intelligence and their service level . 
1		i have tried to eat here off and on for the 8 years i 've lived here . <sssss> none of them were full acclompished trips ! <sssss> i tried to order something just on the 4th of july . <sssss> they were n't all that busy so i walked in and sat at the bar next to the to go register . <sssss> i was in a hurry to get back to work because i only have 30 minutes for lunch . <sssss> i was greeted by a hefty young man and was told someone will be with me shortly . <sssss> ten minutes come and go and the same large waitress walks past me 4 times without a hello and i ca n't seem to find the young man , on top of this the very freakie store manager is behind the counter helping prepare orders , which are flying off the counter fast . <sssss> the manager looks at me often and never does anything but stare at me like a creepy old perv . <sssss> ! <sssss> 4 very loud women run in to the opposite side of the counter and the large waitress tells them hello and they quickly place an order for fries and onion rings . <sssss> shortly after the 4 women pay for their order the large girl walks away like i was n't sitting there , with a menu and waiting for * someone * . <sssss> this place can go to hell ! <sssss> i 'm just going to act like this place never existed and warn others to do the same . 
1		really disappointed . <sssss> first off , i went in on the tv special . <sssss> when i called and asked about insurance , they said , `` no worries ... if insurance does n't cover we 'll make adjustments . '' <sssss> i wound up paying out pocket more than $ 600 for three different sessions of hcg . <sssss> from what i could discern , and believe me ... it was difficult given their completely lax office practices and billing department , they double-billed . <sssss> they billed me and my insurance and when i talked to dr. mascaro -lrb- he acted very compassionate and concerned -rrb- however , he said i needed to work it out with my insurance company ; basically , it was my problem . <sssss> this ordeal went on for more than 6 months and caused me a great deal of stress . <sssss> it became quite clear to me that it really is all about the money for this practice . <sssss> sad and disturbing . <sssss> while i eventually managed to get the bill paid -lrb- more than $ 1600 -rrb- , i walked away feeling completely violated and with absolutely none of my issues resolved . 
1		i really enjoy a nice açai bowl , topped w granola and fresh bananas , it really is not the same without the bananas , i guess they were out if fresh bananas so they just put frozen instead , really how am i supposed to chew a solid frozen banana ? <sssss> first time at this location but i constantly run into this at the metro center location too , i 'm giving up on this place , for a smoothies shop to not have such a staple ingredient as bananas is just embarrassing . <sssss> if i could give it no stars i would , horrible . 
1		i firmly believe everyone is entitled to a `` bad day '' , so i 'll count this as linda 's hoosier cafe 's bad day . <sssss> went in for breakfast the first time hoping to have the same level of service/food quality at the other place called hoosier cafe on warner . <sssss> did n't get even close . <sssss> the goods : waitress was an absolute sweet heart ! <sssss> place seemed really tidy and well kept . <sssss> the prices seem really reasonable . <sssss> there was a good selection of breakfast `` specials '' posted up front . <sssss> the bads : the food took forever to come out . <sssss> my over medium egg had runny whites . <sssss> the bacon was thin and nearly flavorless -lrb- cheap bacon probably kept too long in a steam table -rrb- . <sssss> i love me some bacon , and the fact that i did n't even eat more than 1/2 a piece really says something . <sssss> my coffee cup went empty several times before i got refills . <sssss> the syrup served with the pancakes was awful . <sssss> it was very bland and tasted more like karo syrup with brown coloring as opposed to maple syrup . <sssss> i know real maple syrup is expensive , and for the price i would n't expect it here , but jeez , spend a little more on some higher quality syrup please . <sssss> mrs. butterworth 's would have been better . <sssss> even the tabasco sauce was sub-par . <sssss> the bottle label was all faded and peeling , making me think this place refills with watered down tabasco . <sssss> is that even possible with the tiny bottle openings ? <sssss> all that said , i will go back and give another chance because the waitress was so nice and apologized for the syrup and slowness with the food . <sssss> i also want to try the b&g . <sssss> i think this place could be really good if the management would heed all the negative comments and make some modest changes . 
1		sorry wish i could rate the food , but three strikes and you 're out . <sssss> tried to order online through the app and it would n't work -lrb- kept asking me to agree to the terms but there was no where to select that -rrb- then tried calling , could n't get them to answer . <sssss> then just showed up at the store and waited five minutes but could n't place our order and we noticed the in store prices were different then the pricing online . <sssss> did n't know ordering a pizza would be such an ordeal . <sssss> so were taking this as a sign that the pizza gods are intervening and we should n't have a pizza tonight . <sssss> probably will give papa johns our business tonight instead . 
1		i received flowers today from my best friend for my birthday . <sssss> she ordered them through ftd and they were delivered by flowers 2005 . <sssss> i sent a photo of the arrangement with a thank you text to my friend and she called me immediately letting me know that was not what she order . <sssss> the arrangment consisted of 6 gerber daisys , it looked like a $ 5 bunch of flowers from trader joes with extra greenery . <sssss> an embarrassing situation for us both , glad we are such great friends . <sssss> unfortunately , being new to town and knowing that this is what i can expect from flowers 2005 i will never order flowers from them . 
1		i will never eat here again . <sssss> i do n't recommend any one eat here . 
1		i wish we could choose to rate them zero stars ... the employees at easley 's are the most rudest people i have ever encountered in my life . <sssss> they definitely do n't even deserve 1 star . <sssss> i will never shop here again even if its the last costume store open around halloween . <sssss> let me go ahead and tell you a little bit about what actually happened . <sssss> a couple of days ago me and my daughter who is 10 years old went to easleys to pick out a halloween costume ... my daughter knew exactly what she wanted to be and also knew what she needed . <sssss> she asked an employee for help and this employee was very rude to my daughter . <sssss> she had an attitude with her as if she was just not trying to help at all . <sssss> i do n't know this employees name but she was about 5 ' 3/5 ' 4 and she has very short blonde hair . <sssss> the things she told my daughter was not professional at all . <sssss> this employee called my daughter ugly to another employee , not knowing i over heard her say these nasty disrespectful things . <sssss> i asked her to get her manager . <sssss> which was also a big mistake . <sssss> the manager was not even trying to hear my side of the story . <sssss> she was very rude as well . <sssss> i decided that filing a complaint with the store owner will not do us any justice . <sssss> we went home and filed a complaint against the company with `` bbb '' and we also filed a report with the police yesterday . <sssss> do not go here !! <sssss> you will not get the best of customer service . <sssss> i suggest going to party city , walmart , target , etc. . 
1		ate here for valentine 's day with a prix fixe menu . <sssss> what a rip off ! <sssss> $ 69/person + $ 20/person for wine pairings ... not including a 21 % automatic gratuity for horrible slug-like service !!! <sssss> the waitress was super chatty and nosey when i was trying to have a romantic dinner with my girlfriend . <sssss> the owner went to every table except for ours to greet and make sure everyone was satisfied , although i did catch her looking at our table twice ... is everyone in arizona racist against asians or something ? <sssss> pot pie came out with forks instead of spoons ... huh ?! <sssss> the wrong second course was brought to our table ... and we waited 20 minutes to have our water refilled . <sssss> seriously ?! <sssss> food : the owner should be embarrassed ! <sssss> the menu was entirely new with courses they 've never tested out beforehand ... and it all sucked !!!! <sssss> prawns and scallops were raw ... at least sear the dang thing , the last time i checked i was at a french restaurant , not out having sushi . <sssss> oyster pot pie was disgusting ... might as well have gone to marie calendar 's for that . <sssss> petite filet was decently flavored , but a bit dry . <sssss> dessert was pathetic - you would think a nutella apricot upside down cake would be mouth wateringly delicious , but surprise !!!!!! <sssss> it was a dry flippin cake with burnt nutella on top . <sssss> betty crocker , please teach the chefs at petite maison a thing or two -_- i really wanted to try the infamous foie gras there since its been banned in california , but i 'm so glad i did n't . <sssss> it would 've probably ruined my love for foie gras forever , just like this restaurant ruined what was a perfectly good valentine 's day . <sssss> merci petite maison ... ... ... for the worst experience ever ! 
1		slow , painfully slow service . <sssss> only one register open regardless of the length of line . <sssss> they exist only because they have a perfect location . <sssss> unbelievable the stuff that goes on here yet customers still come on in . <sssss> wait times for food are horrendous . <sssss> there will be numerous people with food in hand in line , yet they sometimes have the only register person also making espresso drinks -lrb- slowing down the entire line -rrb- . <sssss> i guess that 2nd register at the end is just for show . 
1		be very careful planning events with this place . <sssss> they are a major fail at the options they offer - such as not including normal beverages , soft drinks , tea , etc with buffets - and really offer no incentives of any kind with their ` packages ' other than a cheap $ 10 gaming card . <sssss> also started applying pressure to ` book it or lose it ' within 3 hours of talking to them , claiming they have other parties interested . 
1		do n't bother . <sssss> i 've enjoyed taco bell more . 
1		food is eh . <sssss> service is terrible ! <sssss> they are rude and do n't care about customers . <sssss> asked if they had more carrots because they were out in the front the lady went in the back and came out 15 minutes later because another employee told her i was there . <sssss> i asked again about the carrots and she just said `` we do n't have any '' she did n't even look !! <sssss> thanks for telling me and wasting my time ! <sssss> the armados a few blocks down is so much better !! <sssss> i do n't know how this place stays open for business . 
1		do not go if you have extensions ! <sssss> this girl tossed my hair so much while shampooing it got so tangled and matted . <sssss> then even after i mentioned `` why do n't you just use a detangler '' she ripped through my hair with a brush pulling and tugging ! <sssss> she even pulled out like 4 of my extensions ! <sssss> i have the plastic tube extensions -lrb- shrinkies -rrb- too so they 're very easy to wash and style . 
1		i would give 0 stars if i could . <sssss> worst customer service i have ever had . <sssss> not even greeted when i came in . <sssss> no one asked what i needed help with . <sssss> took forever for a very small job . <sssss> inefficient and unfriendly . <sssss> go to kinkos , yes it 's more expensive but you can get in and out fast and the staff is n't rude and does n't mess up your order . 
1		manager jana is totally unprofessional with the employees . <sssss> she can often be found outside smoking while there is a line inside . <sssss> when she does come in , she yells at the employees for not working faster . <sssss> one day , a guy came to the counter and complained about his order . <sssss> she not only was rude to the guy but also made homophobic comments about him to one of her employees . <sssss> highly not recommended . 
1		kitschy decor , annoying tvs , service was ok but disinterested . <sssss> this is a far cry from real new mexican cuisine . <sssss> flavors are muddled and the dominant taste experience is spicy and that 's it . <sssss> lots of bland , greasy cheese and no fresh herbs or fresh flavors . <sssss> tomatillos were absent from an entree that was supposed to have them . <sssss> pozole was spicy and the hominy had no flavor . 
1		we had a 7:45 reservation last night and were not seated til almost one hour late . <sssss> during this time we were given no updates on when we might be seated . <sssss> it was suggested that we go to the bar but it was 10 deep and looked like the bar scene in star wars so that was not an option . <sssss> it is unconscionable for a restaurant as expensive as yours to treat your guests like cattle . <sssss> our waiter was efficient enough but not professional and thought his job was to entertain us like henny youngmen . <sssss> we also noted that the portions of food have been made significantly smaller ie . <sssss> -lrb- the swordfish -rrb- with no reduction in price . 
1		disappointing :-lrb- i was dying for frozen yogurt , wish i had checked to see if red mango has hit phoenix . <sssss> had a scoop of chocolate that was ok . <sssss> unfortunately i also ordered the coconut , which tasted like sunscreen , and ruined my palate for the chocolate . <sssss> i think this is the first time i have ever thrown a dessert away in my life . 
1		september 1 , 2011 will always be known to me as the day i had surgery . <sssss> due to a birth defect , my left kidney was enlarged and obstructed in two places . <sssss> the surgery corrected this life-threatening issue . <sssss> the days that followed will live in my memory for other reasons -- such as being the first time i ever spat out a philly cheesesteak sandwich . <sssss> i had a three-inch incision on the left side of my abdomen . <sssss> after being allowed only clear liquids and intravenous vitamins and minerals for 48 hours , the only thing in my mind that would make me feel human again was a meal . <sssss> and i thought anything would have tasted appetizing . <sssss> two mornings after surgery , my family was visiting and we wanted lunch . <sssss> i scanned the various choices . <sssss> three words caught my eye like a nurse with a needle : cheese steak hoagie . <sssss> i quickly smiled with pleasure , messing up a cheezesteak sandwich is impossible , right ? <sssss> as the hours passed , my hunger grew , finally , the only thought in my mind was how wonderful that cheese steak hoagie would be . <sssss> my mouth began to water as the thought of lunch filled my mind . <sssss> as the smell of real food stopped in front of my door , i quickly sat up and cleared off the small table at my bedside . <sssss> a delightful atmosphere filled the room as dad carried in the treasures . <sssss> my stomach growled louder as the food was within reaching distance . <sssss> all i could think about was the cheeze steak i was about to devour . <sssss> i hurriedly unwrapped my meal , anticipating the mouth-watering sandwich . <sssss> i lifted the sandwich and took a large bite . <sssss> as i began to chew , my hunger quickly subsided as the flavor hit my tongue . <sssss> while i looked around the tray for a napkin , my mother , who had been by my side since arriving at the hospital , knew something was wrong by the expression that came upon my face . <sssss> the napkin became home to the only bite of lunch i ate . <sssss> `` mom , that is the worst thing i have ever tasted , '' i said as i rinsed my mouth out with juice . <sssss> `` it 's worse than the medicine , '' a horrible liquid i had received just before entering the operating room . <sssss> my mother assured me that my intravenous pain killers and other medicines were the cause of the disgusting taste . <sssss> to prove her wrong , i made her try it . <sssss> she pulled off a small portion of the sandwich and began chewing . <sssss> all of a sudden , the same disturbing look that had come over me consumed her . <sssss> she quickly grabbed another napkin and spat out the bite , apologizing and admitting how horrible the meal tasted . <sssss> my appetite had disappeared like a doctor being paged . <sssss> the most memorable meal of my life is one i could n't allow myself to eat . 
1		this is a zero star review . <sssss> i live out in the country . <sssss> wm would only pick up once a month and charged me $ 65.00 per month . <sssss> after three years of this outlandish pricing , a local company began servicing my area , $ 25 per month for two pick ups per month . <sssss> yay . <sssss> now the bad news ... trying to cancel an account with wm is ridiculously hard . <sssss> the rep i spoke to was overbearing and tried to intimidate me . <sssss> i stood my ground . <sssss> he proceeded to tell me that though i had satisfied my contract , he was required to email me cancellation requirements and that i was still responsible for three months of service and had to send a certified letter to wm. i said no to all of the above . <sssss> he said he would email me anyway . <sssss> he did not . <sssss> my attempts to call his private line the next day and thereafter only got me his voice mail . <sssss> he never called me back . <sssss> a week later i called another wm 800 number . <sssss> the woman told me that indeed my account was closed and the container would be picked up soon . <sssss> be very careful if you have to do business with wm. read the contract carefully . <sssss> know your rights so when the cancellation rep starts making things up , you can confront him with your knowledge of the contract . <sssss> wm makes it almost impossible to cancel . <sssss> i will never do business with them again . 
1		went to tryst once for lunch a year ago and it was great so when i saw it on the restaurant week menu i was excited to try it with my spouse and friends . <sssss> sooo not worth it . <sssss> went on a monday night - barely anyone there . <sssss> the service was not great as there were only two servers , albeit friendly . <sssss> the quality of the food was probably in the same level of an applebees or red lobster . <sssss> they were out of almost every dessert . <sssss> we were disappointed and our bill of $ 120 was so not worth it . <sssss> we should have crossed the street and eaten at ocean prime where the value would have been far better . 
1		i 've come here a few times and had an okay experience , however , my last visit was horrible . <sssss> i decided to upgrade from a standard pedicure to the aromatherapy pedicure . <sssss> in the middle of massaging my legs , my pedicurist up and disappears . <sssss> this totally ruined the relaxing experience i was paying for . <sssss> to make it worse , when she finally came back , she was on her cell phone ! <sssss> turns out someone had told her that her phone was ringing and she got up to go get it . <sssss> there is no way that someone can do a pedicure while talking on a cell phone . <sssss> finally , she hung up only to get back on her phone again a few minutes later ! <sssss> no one providing a service like this should be on their phone while doing it . <sssss> i would avoid this place if you are looking for a decent pedicure . 
1		i took my friend here tonight as a `` thank you '' for letting me stay with her for four days . <sssss> i thought with 57 reviews and a 4 star rating i could n't go wrong . <sssss> i was wrong . <sssss> every `` roll '' was a giant pre-made california roll topped with something else . <sssss> the spicy tuna roll had chopped up tuna on top and was not spicy . <sssss> my friend had to ask for a spicy sauce to go with it and the waitress explained that `` our spicy tuna is n't spicy '' . <sssss> the last straw was the salmon roll which was , again , a california roll topped with baked chopped salmon . <sssss> it was inedible . <sssss> i could n't understand why there were so many customers there . <sssss> i would n't eat here again if it were free . <sssss> i wish i had really listened to mar a. 's review . 
1		tried this place april 19th . <sssss> service was great . <sssss> portions not like typical sushi restrurants . <sssss> rice in sushi was very dry . <sssss> fish not fresh . <sssss> service good . <sssss> woke up the following morning with food poisioning . <sssss> i ordered a rainbow roll and seaweed salad . <sssss> thinking it was the rainbow roll that caused my illness . <sssss> it was all i ate all day . <sssss> avoid this place for sushi definately not fresh . <sssss> contacted manager following day regarding the food poisoning and he was rude and said i definitely did n't get it from their restaurant . <sssss> i ensured them that i had only eaten there but he got mad and would n't listen to me . <sssss> i was n't trying to get money back it anything free just wanted to make sure he knew that their fish was n't fresh . <sssss> oh well lesson learned . 
1		absolute terrible experience . <sssss> first time visiting with a friend , and i was looking at some items . <sssss> i playfully touched my friend on her side , and the lady working kicked me out without an explanation . <sssss> apparently my `` behavior '' made the lady uncomfortable . <sssss> this was their reply to me when i emailed them and complained that i was offended , embarrassed and shocked at how i was treated when it was my first time there , '' i would like to apologize for any additional stress that this situation has caused you . <sssss> i assure you that this in not a normal occurrence at frances and our customers are our first priority . <sssss> we have reviewed the security tape several times and spoke multiple times with our employee regarding the incident . <sssss> it seems as though our employee felt uncomfortable with some of the behavior going on between you and your friend . <sssss> although we value each and every customer we also stand behind our employees best judgment on a situation that puts the store and or other customers in an uncomfortable position . <sssss> please accept our apologies and understand that we try to do what is in the best interest of our store and truly mean no harm when doing so . '' <sssss> so for showing my good friend a little bit of affection got me rudely kicked out . <sssss> never shopping here again . 
1		great cheese steak ? <sssss> hardly , try to sell this is philly and you would have customers out the door in a heartbeat . <sssss> first , a cheese-steak need to have substantial roll . <sssss> this one sogged out , they should use the real thing which is available through sysco . <sssss> an amoroso 's roll can stand up to all the juice . <sssss> second , this was n't prime rib-eye , i do n't know what cut it was , but is was tasteless . <sssss> so was the rubbery provolone cheese . <sssss> and last , it was n't clean . <sssss> order the rolls on-line and get your butcher to slice you some rib-eye , homemade is better than anything i 've gotten in phoenix in years . 
1		place is closed they need to update the yelp site they closed with 0 notice to anyone kind of a poor way to treat loyal customers do n't just shit your doors one day without notice 
1		this was my first and last time going to aj sewing . <sssss> i am new to the area , this was close to my house and i use the dry cleaners next door . <sssss> i brought in a bridesmaid dress 3 weeks before i needed it . <sssss> after waiting 15 minutes -lrb- this was a good sign to me -rrb- . <sssss> she fitted me . <sssss> i told her i needed before april 13th . <sssss> she said she would have it done by the 11th . <sssss> a week prior to picking up i bought in a pair of pants and another dress . <sssss> i asked if she could have them ready as well , `` no problem '' . <sssss> i came in on the 11th to pick up and none of the items where done . <sssss> she said she was too busy with prom dresses . <sssss> had she told me this i would have gone some where else . <sssss> i was annoyed because i need to press one of the dresses . <sssss> i was leaving for my sisters destination wedding . <sssss> she said she would iron it , but it was going to wrinkle anyway in the suitcase . <sssss> so she told me to come back tomorrow and everything will be done at 12 pm . <sssss> i came back at 2 just in case . <sssss> the cost was $ 40 -lrb- i thought that was a little expensive -rrb- . <sssss> i had to run some errands so i did n't get to try on everything till that night . <sssss> one dress was n't even done , she did n't iron my dress and come to find out screwed up the alteration . <sssss> i just needed my bridesmaid dress shoulder straps shorten and all through the wedding i had to keep adjusting because my bra was showing , then i wore the pants , one leg was longer than the other . <sssss> you do alterations for a living then things should be perfect . <sssss> i could have gotten over the tardiness but not to do your job is unacceptable ! <sssss> i will never go there and warn others to stay away . <sssss> and i think she smokes around the clothes because everything stunk ! 
1		sushi places are a dime a dozen in this town , and in my mission to try them all , i met a friend at stingray for happy hour . <sssss> the food was decent . <sssss> i 've certainly had better . <sssss> the las vegas roll was a little heavy on the rice and tempura . <sssss> the drinks were exceptionally good . <sssss> i had the asian blonde , which is lychee and champagne , ca n't go wrong there . <sssss> my friend 's drink was something with raspberries and rose water . <sssss> it was amazing . <sssss> all that being said , the service was awful . <sssss> once our food was delivered our waitress disappeared . <sssss> i got one refill on my water , and considering that i drink water like its going out of style , this is completely unacceptable . <sssss> my empty glass sat on the edge of the table for the remainder of dinner . <sssss> once we were done eating , we could n't get the bill , as our waitress was still missing . <sssss> some 20 + minutes after we were completely done eating she appeared again , and we requested the bill . <sssss> once the bill arrived , it took the waitress an additional 15 to 20 minutes to come pick it up . <sssss> it was taking so long that i actually held the bill and credit cards up and out past the edge of the table , hoping someone passing by would offer to take it , or atleast offer to send our waitress over . <sssss> busboys went by , the hostess went by several times , other waitresses went by , the manager even went by , and they all pretended like they did n't see me holding the bill . <sssss> i 've never had such a difficult time trying to get someone to take my money ; it was truly infuriating . <sssss> stingray is definitely getting crossed off my list . <sssss> i do n't have time for bad service . 
1		not that great and expensive even for happy hour ! <sssss> probably wo n't come here again . 
1		i received a groupon for this place at christmas . <sssss> they will not answer their phones , in fact when you call it tells you on the message they will not make appointment for groupon holders , that you have to go to groupon to make the appointment which by the way has been the same since i tried in december . <sssss> clear out to august . <sssss> it is a ripoff and all they want to do i think is get us to purchase and not give us the service . <sssss> i have left messages for loretta who will not return calls . <sssss> that tells me customers mean nothing . <sssss> do n't waste your time . <sssss> i am going to see about filing a complaint with the bbb and try and get my money back . <sssss> in this economy we all like a deal , but we also want the services . <sssss> such as shame ! 
1		i do n't understand this place . <sssss> the wait was long -lrb- 40 minutes -rrb- ; lucky of us , the shopping mall distracted us . <sssss> i had the spicy cashew chicken over rice . <sssss> it was not spicy ; the chicken was bland -lrb- because it was pre-boiled ? -rrb- <sssss> ; the sauce was pure hoisin from a jar . <sssss> did the cook put the entire jar of hoisin sauce in this dish , and not other spice ? <sssss> the sauce and the chicken did not go together at all . <sssss> my wife had the chicken mushroom lettuce wrap . <sssss> it was ok at best . <sssss> we ended the meal with the warm apple crisp with ice cream . <sssss> it was way too sweet ; spoon for spoon , pure sugar would be less sweet . <sssss> only the vanilla ice cream and whipped cream were any good . <sssss> oh , one more good thing was the complementary bread and butter served ahead of the meal . <sssss> the service was average . <sssss> so , why is this place so crowded that we had to wait 40 minutes for a table ? <sssss> the chance i returned to this restaurant is very slim . <sssss> not recommended . 
1		i 'll try anything twice , that 's always been my motto . <sssss> while the staff is very kind there is a hint of disdain . <sssss> perhaps it was my `` bearded for her pleasure '' shirt . <sssss> i actually enjoyed everything about this restaurant , except for the food , atmosphere and service . 
1		do they think we poped up in la or ny ? <sssss> the entire security staff at this hotel has the worst attitude . <sssss> this is not the best place to go , unless your there on a goshtly dead night , they ca n't handle the pressure of more than 1 party at a time . <sssss> can you say meathead stay away from the juice ? <sssss> if you can , your in ... my suggestion is the sushi aroku , as they are owned by different owners and customer service still means something to them . <sssss> its in the lobby , but do n't expect to take your night cap out to the bar if you bought it at the sushi restaruant , different liquor license means `` you no go outside '' restaruant with your drinks , stay put baby ... and drink up . 
1		i use to find good stuff here now and again , but now this place seriously sucks . <sssss> prices are way to high , and the place is small . 
1		watch yourself if you 're near this place . <sssss> i was just out to go to leslie pool supply in the same parking lot and almost got creamed by one of their employees moving cars and speeding through the stop sign behind the arby 's . <sssss> this is a common occurrence & i 've almost been hit by one of their employees at least a half dozen times . <sssss> i 'd rather rent from enterprise and put up with the high pressure car wash sales tactics at cobblestone , than go to this place . 
1		this is the worst place to take your animal . <sssss> they had us wait for 3 hours and never did any thing for my dog . <sssss> they said they were busy with a dieing cat . <sssss> after 3 hours all they did was come in and ask if we wanted blood work and tests for $ 786.00 . <sssss> my dog was having seizures , and the seizures had stopped , so we left and took him to my regular vet the next day . <sssss> they charged us $ 75.00 for doing nothing but let us sitting for 3 hours waiting for them to serve us . <sssss> i do not think we should have had to pay because they did nothing ... be careful they are very unprofesssional ... 
1		i could n't believe it -- i had breakfast at this location not long ago and it was great -lrb- as far as fast food is concerned -rrb- however last friday after helping our son move all day long we went to this wendy 's for a late dinner -- like 8:30 p -- we had a couple burgers and fries . <sssss> a couple of the new ciabatta bacon cheeseburgers = = the bread on the ciabatta was so stale the top of the bun cracked when touched -- the meat patties on the burgers were luke warm and basically tasteless -- i found out why -- the kids working the place had pre-cooked a whole stack of patties on the grill and were using those to make the sandwiches -- blah -- one f the push button soda machines was putting our nothing but carbonated water -- we told them = = they replied that they knew it and instructed us to use the other machine -- -lrb- no sign -- no apology -rrb- - we do n't know if it was the young group running the place or was i close to closing ?? <sssss> what we do know is it will be a long time before we return -- shameful 
1		i would never recommend anyone to go this school . <sssss> there online program sucks . <sssss> there financial service sucks even more and the counselor will harass you , call and email you crazy . <sssss> very annoying . <sssss> the first online class is an intro class to the school to get you to know the online program and the charge you for that , $ 1000 just to walk you through the online school site , that 's bullshit it should be free or cheaper . <sssss> $ 1000 is to much for a get to know the school class . <sssss> yes they charge $ 1000 a class , in my case i did not pass a class , they put me into the next then they take me out of the class and i get charged $ 500 for attending the class half the time , another bullshit move by them . <sssss> so know i would have to take the same class later and get billed for it again . <sssss> that would be $ 1500 for the class . <sssss> so if you do n't pass a class you will have to pay out of pocket for that class , you will know be able to continue until you pay for it , even if you have financial aid . <sssss> yes i messed up , but it should not be this difficult to go to school , the school bills you for everything . <sssss> bullshit school , after many complaints i have talk to people that also hate this school . <sssss> i should have done more research , which is my fault . <sssss> so this is warning to others , this school will rob you . <sssss> this place gets no stars , that one is just to post this . 
1		so , we traded our timeshare for this one . <sssss> what a mistake , furnishing were so uncomfortable , not able to sit for any length of time . <sssss> we were on the second floor , no elevators , had to drag our suitcases up to our room . <sssss> not a good choice . <sssss> if you have a choice to trade , do not pick this place . <sssss> by the way , the bathroom , only one sink was probably built for a handicap level . <sssss> if you are tall , very strange to have to bend so far over the sink ... and , the desk constantly called to set up time to discuss buying , extremely annoying . <sssss> never again ... 
1		in april i visited this location because once again i had what i suspected was a sinus infection -lrb- an annual event with me -rrb- . <sssss> i had been to other locations in previous years for the same problem . <sssss> i was happy to discover this new location located less than a half mile from where i live . <sssss> the waiting room was empty and my wait was only about 20 minutes . <sssss> the examination took even less time . <sssss> i was given an rx for antibiotic , which cleared it up . <sssss> i had just become eligible for medicare and was told that i owed nothing on the day i visited . <sssss> today , almost 4 months later , i received a bill . <sssss> fastmed had billed medicare $ 295.00 for the visit , of which medicare paid $ 156.31 , leaving me a balance to pay of $ 138.69 . <sssss> this is more than i have paid in previous years when i had no insurance ! <sssss> the $ 295.00 billing is outrageous ! <sssss> next time i will make appointment with a regular doctor . <sssss> by the way , the bill -lrb- the first i have received from them -rrb- also shows `` over 90 days '' which will undoubtedly show up on my credit history . <sssss> no thanks fast med . <sssss> this is a rip off ! 
1		terrible value . <sssss> ordered pasta entree . <sssss> . <sssss> $ 16.95 good taste but size was an appetizer size . <sssss> . <sssss> no salad , no bread no vegetable . <sssss> this was . <sssss> our second visit . <sssss> i will not go back . 
1		awful service and food . <sssss> you are ignored and management and owners do not care . 
1		got seated right away . <sssss> ordered drinks and they arrived fast . <sssss> then all went wrong . <sssss> waited half hour for refill then got to order food . <sssss> ordered the trio platter . <sssss> arrived cold and sloppy . <sssss> the portion size was terrible . <sssss> the wings were not hot they were dry and tasteless . <sssss> my nephews kids plate had bigger mini cheeseburgers then mine ! <sssss> and it looks like the steak burrito thing they got on there was taken from a short end piece . <sssss> the manager took my meal off when i complained but he said next time order something else if i do n't like the portion size . <sssss> are you kidding me . <sssss> next time ? <sssss> how about next time i go to village in which is next door . <sssss> food is like denny 's but at least it is served fast , hot , and portions are good . <sssss> do n't go to this apple bees if you can help it . <sssss> find another one . <sssss> or go to the carl 's jr next door you will save money and will be more satisfied . 
1		on our date night , my wife and i decided to stop here for dinner before a movie at desert ridge . <sssss> we were greeted right away -lrb- the place was pretty empty at 6pm on a saturday -rrb- and seated at the back corner table . <sssss> we had plenty of time to look at the menu , as our waitress seated a table two up from us , took their drink order , stopped by the table next to ours to check on them , looked at us , walked back to the front of the restaurant , then came back to see if we 'd been helped . <sssss> uh , no . <sssss> the person that seated us apparently had n't told her we were seated - even though it was her section and she saw us when checking on the other customers . <sssss> she did apologize , but i did n't buy it . <sssss> there 's a difference between trying to pass the buck and blame someone else vs. actually being sorry about letting you sit there . <sssss> ok , over that . <sssss> let 's order . <sssss> couple beers , and a couple of signature sandwiches -lrb- pulled pork , with the blue cheese cole slaw not on the sandwich for one -rrb- . <sssss> for our sides , hq -lrb- that 's the wife -rrb- got the mac-n-cheese and i asked her choice between fries and mashed potatoes . <sssss> fries were good , she said . <sssss> done . <sssss> got the beers . <sssss> i 'd swear the beer was flat . <sssss> maybe an old keg . <sssss> it happens . <sssss> after that , the food came out quick . <sssss> the pulled-pork sandwich had zero sauce . <sssss> literally just bun and pulled pork . <sssss> ok , we 'll add our own from the bottle on the table -lrb- i 'm thinking honey bears where it 's got bbq sauce with the meat -rrb- . <sssss> the sandwich was average at best . <sssss> no taste . <sssss> the sauce , not being mixed with the meat , just had nothing to it . <sssss> and the blue cheese cole slaw that was on the side , again , absolutely no taste . <sssss> bland . <sssss> now the fries . <sssss> the menu said russett fries . <sssss> i guess i 'm picturing steak-like fries . <sssss> nope . <sssss> just plain ol' fies . <sssss> and these were not actually cooked all the way . <sssss> not good . <sssss> to summarize : flat beer , bland bbq sandwich , bland blue cheese cole slaw , and undercooked fries . <sssss> safe to say it 's not a place we 'll go to again . 
1		owner would not provide confirmation numbers so we cancelled room after 10 phone calls - 4 months in advance of the intended stay date . <sssss> he called my wife a liar on the phone . <sssss> i bet anybody who stays here for any reason would enjoy it a lot ... 
1		i love bosa donuts i have been to several locations and this is by far the worst . <sssss> the lady that works there with the funky colored eyeshadow has been rude to me on 2 different occasions . <sssss> i have never been greeted by her . <sssss> she tossed my card to me at the register when she was done swiping it . <sssss> little things like that just really piss me off . <sssss> especially when i am a repeat customer . <sssss> i suggest going to the bosa donuts in mesa by bookmans ! <sssss> the people there are nice and the facility is very clean ! <sssss> go where u are appreciated . 
1		to start off , i 'm not a snob . <sssss> when i go to a subway , i do not expect the worlds best , or even middling sandwich . <sssss> i do however expect something edible . <sssss> i 've had subway sanwiches from coast to coast , and i can say without a doubt that from the service , to the finished product , this outlet serves stands out as the worst in every way , the bread tatsted sour , the meat tasted old , and they didnt put the correct toppings on , i was unable to direct them since they seemed to be in the middle of a rush , the fact that i was the only person there makes me think the rush was more to get a smoke break . <sssss> sometimes i crave a spicy italian sub , but this place really took the cravinging out of me . <sssss> i 've driven by oither subways , and debated , but the fact that this place took my money for 2 sandwiches that my wife and i couldnt eat more than 2 bites of , i even took the meat out and tried to see if i could eat just the meat ... but couldnt , has made subway a chain that it will be a long time till i risk another chance with . <sssss> which is a shame , because for cheap eats , they have always been a decent value . <sssss> i wrote the customer service line , and got a prompt response from the main headquarters , but the local owner never responded , which lets me know where the problem is , or at least is a huge clue . 
1		this was one of the worst persian food experience of my life . <sssss> it is a small restaurant with no ambiance . <sssss> one waiter for the whole place . <sssss> the waiter was not flexible with the menu . <sssss> it was expensive for a neighborhood dive and the food was tasteless . <sssss> go to the persian room instead . <sssss> our food was so bad it was n't even worth sending it back . <sssss> poor service poor ambiance poor food poor experience over priced 
1		i have n't been in a while and i really do n't plan on going back . <sssss> the costco deal has risen from $ 299 for 2 years to about $ 70 more . <sssss> the gym is warm . <sssss> the a/c went out for a while last summer and they took a long time to fix it . <sssss> the biggest problem is that this gym really only cares about getting your money . <sssss> the trainers have quotas and will try and guilt you into buying more sessions and product . <sssss> i hear them talking only about sales tactics and quotas - never a thing about helping people . <sssss> the manager has sales one on ones in the cubicle bullpen in front of clients . <sssss> i would have given it 2 stars if it was n't so warm when i go there . 
1		well , we heard this scottsdale classic has gone south , but i refused to believe it . <sssss> so , when guest from asia visited and wanted to do the sanctuary , i said lets do roaring fork , no view but great food and service . <sssss> well , tonight -lrb- 11/25/11 -rrb- was a disaster ... they were over welmed by a table of 7 , food was poor quality and everyone ate at different times . <sssss> all the staff said the `` right words '' but no one performed . <sssss> so , i fear this place is now destined , as i was `` warned '' , for the scrap heap of restaurant history . <sssss> shame on you ! 
1		ah , sephora ... how i love you . <sssss> except you , chandler sephora . <sssss> you 're tacky and i hate you -lrb- yeah , i just quoted school of rock -rrb- . <sssss> well to start this review off , i work at starbucks and customer service has always been something i 've been passionate about . <sssss> i love making customers feel comfortable and creating an environment that people want to come back to . <sssss> but i also understand how hard business can be and that some days are unbearable . <sssss> so it 's safe to say that i never and i mean never complain about customer service . <sssss> i might observe and critique internally but i have enough decency to keep it to myself because it is not my job to ruin people 's days by being ` that customer ' at work . <sssss> however , today i was ` that customer ' and i can guarantee you that the representatives of this sephora definitely talked about me when i left . <sssss> do i give a crap ? <sssss> nope , i just want people who come into this store to understand what i dealt with today . <sssss> it was my birthday and i just got my hair done and decided to exhange a few products i got two weeks ago that i never even used twice because my skin broke out and the overall finish was terrible . <sssss> anyway , as i walked in i was greeted by a lady who seemed to be the store manager because she was talking to a customer by me about how she runs her store . <sssss> i was looking at primers on sephora 's little `` favorites '' rack -lrb- or whatever it 's called -rrb- since it has a variety of top rated stuff that most customers at sephora like . <sssss> i was approached by the same manager i was talking about but she was with a customer and she goes `` uh , can i help you ? '' <sssss> . <sssss> `` no , thank you . <sssss> i 'm fine '' as i proceeded to look through primers but think to myself ` wow , that was pretty harsh . <sssss> and i just walked in oh god this is going down hill already ' . <sssss> after grabbing a primer and walking around givenchy the manager approached me once again and says `` can i help you now ? '' <sssss> . <sssss> oh dear lord , at this point i assumed she was having a bad day and shrugged it off as i asked about a good foundation . <sssss> instead of even talking about foundations with me she looks into the sephora bag i brought in for the exchange and goes `` oh , you 're returning ? <sssss> what 's in there ? '' <sssss> so then , i told her the products i had and how they made me break out pretty bad -lrb- i even came in without make up to show literally how bad the break out effected my skin weeks earlier -rrb- . <sssss> instead of even acknowledging anything i said or even giving me an idea of the foundations they had , she goes `` oh , we do n't carry becca here except a primer so i ca n't return that '' . <sssss> i then asked her why because i definitely bought it at a free standing sephora and i 've never been told no like that ever before . <sssss> so she takes my product and scans it and it was in the system so she said she 'd be able to exchange it but that i 'd have to wait 15 minutes to be helped . <sssss> 15 minutes ? <sssss> i said nope -lrb- in my head -rrb- and went and tried to color match myself with an old foundation i loved since the woman gave me no opinions on foundations even though it was my only question . <sssss> 5 stars for nikki though ! <sssss> she was awesome , she noticed me swatching colors and automatically helped me a minute after being told i 'd have to wait ! <sssss> she did awesome and i literally love everything she matched me with and gave me . <sssss> she even told me to return it if i had any more problems . <sssss> so i told her how her manager was treating me and she took full responsibility and said sorry and even took my stuff to the register for me and hooked me up with a bunch of samples . <sssss> oh , you think i 'm done ? <sssss> nope . <sssss> i waited ten minutes in line even though there was only one person in front of me because the second cashier was too busy talking to another employee about her makeup and how she needed to fix her powder . <sssss> i was frustrated because i did have a time frame that i gave a good amount of time for sephora but customers at this store are obviously not the top priority , being that i had to wait again ten minutes just for the same manager to come to the register to tell me i could n't make a return because i did n't have a valid id . <sssss> funny part is , i called sephora 's hotline to ask about a return with no receipt and they said it would be no problem as long as i was fine with an exchange or merchandise credit . <sssss> i kept my mouth shut though because i knew i could just go to a better store that 's further but has always treated me well . <sssss> after the manager left with a huge smile on her face , she came back with a plaque that told me about the id policy even though it said clearly on there that an exchange could be made . <sssss> but again , i kept my mouth shut . <sssss> finally , the girl at the register proceeded to tell me `` oh , i knew you needed your id . <sssss> that was a waste of time * giggles * so can you pay for this ? '' <sssss> oh lord , i was done . <sssss> i was so frustrated that i ended up being a little girl and teared up because i felt so disrespected . <sssss> she then proceeded to laugh and nudge the other cashier when i teared up . <sssss> oh i will never be returning . <sssss> sephora should definitely look into this store & their management . 
1		bravo ted s. tell it like it is . <sssss> this place is junk . <sssss> cold food , twice out of the 2 times i 've been there . <sssss> wo n't make a 3rd mistake . 
1		horrible , horrible horrible ! <sssss> 9 ladies for a birthday lunch , 35 minutes passed before the wine we ordered was delivered , another 30 to 45 minutes before our order was taken and then at least 45 minutes before our entrees were brought out , one plate at a time !! <sssss> the owner -lrb- ? -rrb- <sssss> came by to address our concerns and had one excuse after another as to why things went wrong . <sssss> when i told him numerous calls to reserve a table went unanswered , -lrb- calls went directly to a voice message saying they were open for lunch and dinner -rrb- , he said `` we have a digital system , did n't you get directed to prompts ? '' <sssss> -lrb- even if i did get said prompts , who wants to make a reservation for a simple lunch the same way you are trying to have a conversation with your credit card company ? -rrb- <sssss> i said no , all i got was a dial tone . <sssss> i then told him their website directed me to opentable.com to make a reservation , i went to opentable only to get a message narcisse is no longer a member . <sssss> the owners response ? <sssss> `` our problem with opentable is that we are a nightclub '' what in the world does that mean ? <sssss> if you are a nightclub , be a nightclub-do not tout yourself as a lunch/dinner restaurant . <sssss> we are an easy going group of women age 40 to 60 who meet once a month for lunch , price is never an issue and we never , ever do the dreaded separate check thing so rarely have issues but this outing was absolutely the worst experience we have ever had , individually or collectively . 
1		i have now learned to avoid the network 's bar and grill . <sssss> the main reason is the poor service . <sssss> anytime anyone pops in staff should greet the customer these folks ignore customers frequently . <sssss> six times this year i was told that the downtown partnership 20 % discount is no longer accepted - which is a bold face lie . <sssss> the restaurant staff merely hates to deal with their inept manager who hides the required computer card for this discount from them . <sssss> thankfully there are dozen 's of options only steps away . <sssss> although i 've been to the networks over 3,000 times since it opened some 15 years ago , it now will be my last stop if that . 
1		great design , but do n't let the pictures fool you . <sssss> this place attempts to be upscale , but yet its simply a bunch of upscale pieces put together . <sssss> no polish . <sssss> the place is a renovated old motel . <sssss> i 'm not a picky person when it comes to hotels , but after reading the positive and negative reviews , i 'm leaning towards negative . <sssss> i stayed here a total of 4 nights , because i booked it through hotels.com -- stayed here for a business trip . <sssss> here 's why i 'm rating it really negative : 1 -rrb- my room , was half painted in the bathroom . <sssss> i sort of laughed at this , but thought it was odd . <sssss> 2 -rrb- roach in room , on the table , upside down , with feet still moving . <sssss> not clean at all ! <sssss> stay downtown at the wyndham instead imo -- super clean . <sssss> 3 -rrb- i typically tip housekeeping $ 2 per day . <sssss> after the first night , came back from work , and found out they they didnt take the trash out , and they took my soap and didnt leave a new one . <sssss> people forget sometimes , including housekeeping . <sssss> so , i left $ 1 the next day . <sssss> big mistake . <sssss> they took the new soap i requested from the front desk , took all the towels from the room without leaving any new ones , and left the trash again . <sssss> 4 -rrb- $ 15 hotel surcharge -- this is such a joke . <sssss> it covers a bottle of water which they never replenish unless you go to the front desk , use of their `` business center '' which is a old dell circa 20th century , and some other things that seemed lame . <sssss> 5 -rrb- their rooftop lounge is covered in grime and is rundown . <sssss> no one ever goes up there . <sssss> also , do n't expect any decent service i guess unless you plan on leaving $ 5 + / day for housekeeping i guess . <sssss> btw , i do realize that hotel management reads all these reviews and comments that `` oh sorry , but yada yada -lsb- insert excuse here -rsb- . <sssss> please stay again or do this and we will address the matter '' . <sssss> problem is , that it only works the first dozen times you do that . <sssss> afterwards it just seems lame that you continue to make excuses instead of fixing the problem . <sssss> as an anecdotal side note : i actually needed to extend my stay an extra night , and didnt want to move my luggage/check into a new hotel so i asked the front desk how much was the rate to stay an extra night . <sssss> they replied $ 149 - $ 199 for friday night . <sssss> i was being dead serious and wanted an exact figure . <sssss> again , the lady danced around the topic ! <sssss> she said $ 149 - $ 199 . <sssss> how can there be an ambiguity with the rate ? <sssss> so i said , `` so its $ 149 for the room , plus the $ 15 hotel fee , and tax ? '' <sssss> . <sssss> she responds `` sir , i 've already mentioned to you that its $ 149 - $ 199 plus the hotel fee and tax . '' <sssss> wtf is that ? <sssss> that was the last of that . <sssss> i called up wyndham and they told me it was $ 189 for the night . <sssss> i would rather pay more for better service and a straight forward answer instead of the runaround . <sssss> lastly , for what this hotel is , its a bit pricey . 
1		repair guys are nice , but it 's been two months and the dryer still does n't work . <sssss> telephone customer service is terrible !!! <sssss> if you like abusive relationships , then subject yourself their receptionist . <sssss> they already have my $ 300 so i 'm stuck . <sssss> i would go elsewhere if i had $ 300 to spare ! 
1		i wish i could leave negative stars . <sssss> this establishment is by far the worst fast food restaurant i 've ever been in - and i 've been in a lot . <sssss> the employees here clearly hate their jobs . <sssss> i always hope it would change , because let 's face it , sometimes you want a dang whopper . <sssss> that was the case for me tonight . <sssss> i walk in - hear the door chime to alert people i was there . <sssss> i stood at the empty counter and waited . <sssss> no one shows up . <sssss> so i shift a little bit since there 's an employee there washing trays . <sssss> she makes eye contact with me then quickly looks away . <sssss> i wait a few minutes longer . <sssss> so after more than 5 minutes of waiting to have my order taken ... i just decided to leave . <sssss> this is not the first bad experience i 've had here . <sssss> it 's gone through a few management changes over the past few years , i always thought the service would change ... but it never has . <sssss> their slogan is `` have it your way '' , so why is that me , as a customer , asking for the fries to be cooked longer is mocked by the manager ? <sssss> do you think we ca n't hear you ? <sssss> additionally , please know that just because a person looks a certain ethnicity does n't mean we do n't understand spanish ;-rrb- the floors are almost always sticky . <sssss> the trash usually overflows . <sssss> it 's just horribly ran . 
1		i have been a regular at china chili for over 10 years . <sssss> sadly once they moved to the new location on 3rd street and flower their quality has been deteriorating . <sssss> went recently for lunch and ordered the mongolian beef and beef foo young and both were awful , no taste , no flavor and very sub standard . <sssss> the prices have gone up the quality is shameful . <sssss> i think that the orange chicken is possibly their best item right now but sadly did not have it . <sssss> thought i would explore to other dishes but never again . <sssss> not sure i will be back , possibly for lunch for the orange chicken . <sssss> with so many other choices of asian food . <sssss> . <sssss> this local favorite has not kept up its quality . 
1		these guys are a total fraud . <sssss> i had a problem with the starter in my car and i towed it here . <sssss> they fixed it with glue and charged me usd500 -lrb- claiming that they replaced it -rrb- . <sssss> within less than a year the starter gaveup and i towed my car back to midas -lrb- since the starter was under one year warranty -rrb- . <sssss> they did not honour the warranty and they gave me absurd reasons . <sssss> i have never been to these fraudulent people after that . <sssss> dont take your car hear , if you want to get a `` real '' repair done . 
1		wow . <sssss> this was the single worst experience i have ever had in a store . <sssss> that sounds like a bold statement but i am confident that it is the truth . <sssss> as a usual mac customer i decided to give ulta a try since the closest mac is 35 minutes away and ulta is a mere 13 minutes . <sssss> i walked in and they were busy . <sssss> i can understand that since it was homecoming . <sssss> i wandered the isles aimlessly in hopes an employee would offer her assistance . <sssss> 3 employees past me without as much as a hello . <sssss> . <sssss> not even eye contact . <sssss> i finally started speaking to my kids in a volume that someone would be able to hear me . <sssss> `` gee , i wish i could get some help '' ... finally someone asked me if i needed help . <sssss> i explained to her that i am a mac customer but i wanted to see if they had something similar that i could get . <sssss> i just wanted something to put on before i put on my make up so that it would stick . <sssss> she told me she would find someone who is familiar with mac products and she would be right back . <sssss> i waited . <sssss> and i waited . <sssss> and i waited . <sssss> finally i saw her walking back with someone . <sssss> she asked her , `` do you know mac 's stuff ? '' <sssss> the other girl responded , `` no . <sssss> i do n't know mac 's stuff and i do n't like them . <sssss> their stuff clogs your pours . '' <sssss> then she looked at me and shot me the dirtiest look . <sssss> i said , `` thanks that does n't really help me does it ? '' <sssss> she walked away and the first girl disappeared . <sssss> i waited . <sssss> and i waited . <sssss> and i waited . <sssss> then finally she comes back and informs me that they do not have a product like that . <sssss> i walked out . <sssss> furious . <sssss> i doubt that they do not have a product like that at all . <sssss> i doubt that mac invented something like that . <sssss> i waisted 45 minutes in ulta that day . <sssss> in that amount of time i could have driven to mac , got my product and been headed home . <sssss> i may have picked up a new eye shadow too because the girls there are so awesome . <sssss> ulta made me feel stupid for going there . <sssss> in all my years in customer service i never would make someone feel stupid for trying to come to my store . <sssss> if ulta 's products are really better than mac 's tell me why . <sssss> do n't just give me a dirty look and walk away ! <sssss> i tried to call the customer service line and they are closed on the weekends . <sssss> i tried to call the store and speak to a manager and the phone rang off the hook . <sssss> i did manage to call the customer service line monday morning and got a weak apology . <sssss> thanks i 'll stick to mac . 
1		hmmm , after my experience yesterday , i am really puzzled as to why this restaurant has received such great reviews . <sssss> my salad -lrb- a southwestern salad -rrb- was lacking key ingredients : lacking avocado , black beans , and cilantro . <sssss> the chicken was overdone , and the greens were old and wilted . <sssss> and the service was absolutely atrocious : no courtesy , no greeting , no smile , no nothing . 
1		i also would never step inside a walmart but could not resist the $ 99 iphone sale . <sssss> i 'll give them one star as most people seemed well intended . <sssss> but i was amazed at how poor the service was . <sssss> it took almost 45 minutes to purchase a phone because the manager helping us did n't have authority to log in to the main computer . <sssss> the store was severely understaffed . <sssss> several workers had their shirts half tucked in . <sssss> their walkies on blast . <sssss> workers yelling down aisles . <sssss> zero sense of urgency to complete a sale . <sssss> our salesperson repeatedly shared that he hated the iphone -lrb- that i was intending to purchase -rrb- . <sssss> i could never imagine this conversation at best buy . <sssss> i was n't going to report this ridiculously awful experience because , again , the man helping me meant well . <sssss> i place 100 % of the blame on upper level management not trusting their staff , poor training , not investing in their staff 's well being & not passing on authority to put customers first . <sssss> when i purchased my iphone , i asked that the terms of my data plan not be altered . <sssss> they assured me several times that it would not . <sssss> when i got home , i learned that actually they had changed my plan and it took two days of speaking with at&t to revert back -lrb- my plan is amazing and no longer offered -rrb- . <sssss> after the unnecessary headache of getting my plan reinstated , i thought it important to leave a review . <sssss> i 'm very happy with my phone , certainly at this price , but if at all possible stay far away from this store . <sssss> at least until walmart starts training and supporting their staff properly . 
1		filthy restaurant . <sssss> tables greasy ; napkin holder was coated w food and grease . <sssss> afraid that if the surroundings are so unclean , what is the silverware , produce , soda machine & ice dispenser like ? <sssss> will i be sick in a few days to a week from an innocent lunch here ? <sssss> pizza is fabulous , but worth the risk ? <sssss> i do n't think so . <sssss> will go back in in 1week to see if the owner i spoke to has his staff better trained . <sssss> time to lean , time to clean ... there was plenty of time . 
1		will not be back . <sssss> i started having lunch here every day last week -lrb- 10/30 -rrb- and was going to continue but then the manager gave me a hard time about not honoring the hon discount when i forgot my badge today -- went on to tell me to wear my badge on my shirt `` in a noticable location moving forward or i would not receive the discount '' . <sssss> realy ? <sssss> not smart -- my daily lunch business is going next door to the greek place . 
1		many of the reviews of j. alexander 's have been quite descriptive so i 'm going to keep mine short and to the point : i did not enjoy my experience here in the least . <sssss> everything about this place is simply `` typical . '' 
1		bad customer service ! <sssss> no one at the front desk for thirty minutes . <sssss> plus they left the phone on the counter so when i tried to call their number , phone just kept ringing and ringing . <sssss> : -lrb- 
1		five stars for fakers . <sssss> red carpet entrance and horribly silly and stupid revolving door set the tone for this ridiculous adventure . <sssss> #layout just makes no sense . <sssss> it 's like someone had a vision for a bar and then squished in all this other stuff wherever it could fit , including the tables . <sssss> #the singer is real , but his music accompaniments are all cheap karakoke tracks , akin to their casio bossanova-button-rythm and one-finger-bass section ancestors . <sssss> think price-is-right canned tracks but where are the beauties ? <sssss> #come on , they 've got a baby grand up there . <sssss> where 's the live music like they have at eddie v 's across the way ? <sssss> #shuffled up to the rooftop pool patio -lrb- enclosed -rrb- for table at pool 's edge . <sssss> #ordering computer/pos/credit card terminal is on low shelf behind us . <sssss> great spot to learn your servers ' underwear brand preferences ! <sssss> #check out the pics . <sssss> steak served alone , plopped on a searing hot plate . <sssss> except there 's nothing to sear . <sssss> i try to explain that the steak is still cooking on that hot plate , but server just ignores . <sssss> head to eddie v 's for the best steakhouse experience in the area . 
1		we moved to the south scottsdale area about a week before thanksgiving . <sssss> being from chicago , this was the pizza we had to try . <sssss> the food is amazing , but the customer service stinks . <sssss> we 've ordered 5 times at least and have had a major delay 2 out of those 5 times . <sssss> tonight i placed an order for pickup . <sssss> it is a 40 minute pickup time , but since the food is great , i agree . <sssss> i arrived on time for pickup to discover that the woman had n't even added the wings on to our order . <sssss> i asked how long for the wings . <sssss> she tells me 20 minutes . <sssss> i told her to forget the wings , we 'll just take the rest of the order . <sssss> she then tells me that the order is n't ready and that i am looking at another 20 minutes . <sssss> tired from just arriving from a plane trip , i agree to pay upfront and have them deliver . <sssss> i noticed while i was there that they had taken the phones off the hook because they could n't accommodate any more orders . <sssss> even with $ 10 off the bill , i am outraged ! <sssss> it took almost another hour for them to deliver the food i had paid for upfront . <sssss> i tried calling , but phones were still not being answered . <sssss> no pizza is worth an 1 hour and 40 minute delivery time !!! <sssss> especially when it was supposed to be a pick up order to begin with . <sssss> good food , but poorly managed . <sssss> if you have that much business , hire more help and do right by your customers !!! <sssss> will not be customers again unless management changes . <sssss> too bad , loved their food ! 
1		fun place . <sssss> great atmosphere . <sssss> food is just awful . <sssss> waitresses are great at throwing extra drinks on your bill . <sssss> happened more than once so check your tab . 
1		first off , i really hoped i would like this place , because i crave good sandwiches , and i absolutely hate subway . <sssss> my daughter said she was done with over half a sandwich left , i was just like , `` there 's no way you 're telling me you 're full off of a couple of bites . '' <sssss> she leaned over and whispered , `` it 's not good , take a bite and see for yourself . '' <sssss> i did , and it was disgusting . <sssss> we think it was the mayo ; it tasted like formaldehyde , which brought back dissecting memories from childhood , i almost puked . <sssss> i spit my bite out and told her to throw it away . <sssss> i ordered a philly cheesesteak . <sssss> the guy behind the counter was very friendly , talking about how their cheesesteaks are the best and win awards . <sssss> i tried it , and it was pretty bad , i could n't even finish my sandwich . <sssss> after a few bites , i threw mine away as well . <sssss> unfortunately , we did n't like it and would not go back . 
1		do n't do it unless you like that i wish i had n't feeling . <sssss> checked out because it was on dd&d 's - will not go back . <sssss> over cooked over sugared food service chinese , disgusting gloppy beans , facility itself is filthy . 
1		i would give this place a 0 but it is not an option . <sssss> i arrive with 5 other of my friends on motorcycles , wearing our usual garb . <sssss> yes we have motorcycle vest 's with out club patch on it . <sssss> we ask a waitress before we park if we can enter wearing our vests and club patch . <sssss> we are told yes , before we jump back on the bikes we see other `` bikers '' in wearing vest 's with patches . <sssss> `` black label society '' , `` hog '' , etc. . <sssss> we pay to park our bikes and when we arrive the door man says we can not wear our vests even though other people are there wearing their vests and patches . <sssss> . <sssss> long story short ; this place welcomes `` fake bikers '' and not real ones . <sssss> discrimination at its best . 
1		terrible pizza , ordered margarita pizza & the toppings slid right off the crust , and the crust was soggy . <sssss> breadsticks tasted like icky too . <sssss> wo n't be coming back !!! <sssss> stay away from this restaurant !!!!! <sssss> wondering if the same owner owns the street of new york in ocotillo area , their food is really good , not sure what happened to this one ???? 
1		so after eating here for a going away lunch for a fellow colleague 3people -lrb- including myself -rrb- have not felt so hot since . <sssss> our p.i. . <sssss> in the office did some research and found that this restaurant recently had an surprise inspection from maricopa county , you should take a moment to read that before you decide to eat here ... 
1		i have tried this place twice now , and it fails to hit the mark . <sssss> everyone else in my party has been happy both times . <sssss> however , i seem to be cursed here . <sssss> whatever i order is always loaded with onions . <sssss> i absolutely hate onions , and i avoid ordering anything that contains onions . <sssss> last time i ate here , i asked for no onions in an omelet ith brie cheese that i was pretty excited about , and they left 'em in there . <sssss> i was too cowardly to demand that it be returned to the kitchen , i so i just did n't eat it . <sssss> today , i ordered a sandwich which mentioned nothing about onions , and they were all over my food . <sssss> yuck ! <sssss> i ordered a muffin to mask the taste , and it did the trick . <sssss> the muffin was the only good thing i 've eaten here . <sssss> however , if you like onions , you might love it ! 
1		if you enjoy being crunched in a tiny space with middle aged wannabe rich women while screaming immigrant babies run rampant through the store this place is for you . 
1		the salespeople here need a serious lesson in manners . <sssss> just because you work where they sell nice clothes does not give you the right to act like a snob and look down on people . <sssss> it does n't matter if i am here to drop a few hundred bucks , the women here look at you like you 're dirt . <sssss> i have given this store multiple chances and the service is so awful i would not recommend coming here unless you 're ready to throw back some dirty looks . <sssss> i do n't understand how these people got hired and why they have n't been fired but here 's a piece of advice ... smile . <sssss> offer help . <sssss> do n't look and treat people like you 're better than them . <sssss> if you hate your job , quit . <sssss> you 're making people miserable when shopping is supposed to be enjoyable . 
1		they do not pay their billls coution if you 're vendor do not trust this company they do not pay . 
1		horrible experience @ this ihop . <sssss> server spilled soda all over the table and the food took over 45 minutes to get to us . <sssss> never going back 
1		super rude . <sssss> took my mom 's car in and they stole her phone charger . <sssss> also pushed a variety of flushes needed and never called us when the car was ready . 
1		i 'll admit i went here out of convenience , 100 % . <sssss> i was staying at the w for a conference , needed to get some work done , so i got takeout and took it up to my room . <sssss> i got three pretty straightforward items : edamame , yellowtail sashimi with diced chiles -lrb- supposedly a `` specialty of the house '' -rrb- , and the tuna jalapeno hand roll - and was underwhelmed with all of them . <sssss> the texture of the edamame was off on about half of the pods i got - grainy and not moist at all . <sssss> the pieces that were prepared well were actually delicious , with just the right amount of salt . <sssss> but wth , why was half of it wonky ? <sssss> the yellowtail sashimi was completely overpowered by the sauce it was covered in . <sssss> do n't get me wrong , the flavors were good , just completely imbalanced . <sssss> way too much sauce , and somehow , something with diced chiles did n't even have a hint of spice to it . <sssss> the yellowtail was sliced so thin that it was unrecognizable even as fish , and the sauce effectively cooked it . <sssss> this is a dish i particularly love , that my favorite sushi restaurant at home serves perfectly , so i was very disappointed . <sssss> these two dishes behind me , i move on to my tuna jalapeno roll . <sssss> based on its name , i 'm expecting a very clean , crisp roll . <sssss> when i open the box , i am accosted with huge dollops of spicy mayo on top of each piece . <sssss> i dab it off so that the roll looks vaguely appetizing , if a bit smeared . <sssss> i 've never tasted a roll so bland in all my life . <sssss> apparently that 's why it was swimming in mayo - to give it some flavor . <sssss> also , it was supposed to come with toro , but they were out of toro and subbed regular tuna , but charged me the same . <sssss> toro is a lot more expensive than regular tuna , so i was n't thrilled about that , but i was expensing dinner , so the cost was really did n't matter . <sssss> that said , if i was actually spending my own money , i definitely would not spend it here . <sssss> yeah , i 'm not from arizona , i 've always lived by some water , so maybe this is the best you can do here , but i really doubt it . 
1		so sad i have to give this local establishment 1 star ; but after 3 attempts to enjoy a meal there , i just ca n't do it captain ! <sssss> we arrived for a late lunch at 3:30 pm and were pleasantly surprised at happy hour in the middle of the day ! <sssss> first off ... it smells like you just walked into the men 's room in mexico , when you first enter from the central avenue entrance ; then it lingers making its way to the bar , thinning out with each step , until you get to a point where you just get used to it arriving at the bar . <sssss> my sister wanted to leave immediately but it was the only place big enough downtown phoenix to bring my bike inside , so we toughed it out-again . <sssss> i torture myself only because i really want to give the downtown establishments a chance ! <sssss> however the food killed it for me this time . <sssss> we ordered appetizers for 3 . <sssss> the homemade salsa with chips and a side of sour cream should n't be that hard to do . <sssss> they won me half way with this because turns out the chips are homemade-and delicious ! <sssss> but the salsa is pace picante . <sssss> if i 'd a known that i would have ordered something else . <sssss> the potato skins came out looking as if they were made previously , then left sitting around for 5 hours , then re-cooked bacon and all ! <sssss> they were dry and crumbly as heck and the ranch dressing was straight out of the bottle -lrb- the horribly tasting one -rrb- . <sssss> the salad was ok , but the ranch made it worse . <sssss> my friend who was visiting from texas enjoyed her french toast , so therein lies the 1 star = breakfast at lunch time yay . <sssss> it looked okay . <sssss> nothing to rave about though . <sssss> since it had been almost 2 years since we all seen each other = a shot was in order ! <sssss> 3 raspberry kamikazi 's please ... what ? <sssss> you do n't know how to make a rasp kami ? <sssss> what a waste of a full bar . <sssss> luckily i knew the ingredients and the measurements ; but funny thing is the bartender , who said she did n't know how to make the drink , kept insisting there was soda water . <sssss> even after explaining the recipe she added soda water = wtf ? <sssss> i have seen crowds waiting to see the murder mystery theater productions held there , but i 'm not sure if i could stand the smell that long ! <sssss> i have to regrettably say this will be my last attempt @_ @ 
1		the food was not very good . <sssss> my pasta sauce tasted like it was from a can and the salmon was fishy tasting . <sssss> i only ate a very small amount . <sssss> my husbands dish of stuffed pork also was nothing to write home about . <sssss> the salad and app and good -- but that was it . <sssss> also the band plays in the bar where we ate and the sound system is terrible . <sssss> you ca n't hear the music very good and certainly ca n't understand a word they say . <sssss> overall this place was n't very good and i would not waste my money to go back . 
1		this review is of the orange tree golf course and management . <sssss> this is not a review of the resort/hotel . <sssss> sad to say but very true -- expect a 5 to 5 1/2 hour round . <sssss> calling for a ranger to come out and help move play along brings a tsunami storm of rude treatment from the ranger and the pro shop . <sssss> it is not a golfer/customer friendly experience . <sssss> it 's supposed to be fun ??? <sssss> we payed $ 69/per player for slow pay -lrb- quit after 9 holes -- at times there were 3 foursomes sitting at a tee waiting -rrb- and very poor treatment . <sssss> best advice - avoid this place . <sssss> too many great courses in the area with quality customer service to waste $ $ and time here . <sssss> visited october 2013 
1		if you can avoid going to this hospital i would strongly recommend doing so . <sssss> your wait time in the er will be at least 2 hours and then another hour waiting for someone to come see you . <sssss> if they start you on antibiotics , you can expect another 60 minute wait for your medicine . <sssss> we had a recent incident that i ca n't go in to for privacy reasons but all i can say is potential lawsuit . <sssss> every time i have come to this hospital there is a hassle , staff always takes the path of least resistance , and are sometimes just downright unhelpful . <sssss> i have also heard horror stories from other people about del webb . <sssss> i 'm normally not a complainer and usually have great experiences wherever i go , but it has been one thing after another with this place . <sssss> if you can , drive another few miles to arrowhead , estrella , or thunderbird . <sssss> even though they are all banners , del webb must not invest in their staff or just do n't care but whatever the case is , compassion and care is not anywhere on their list of priorities . 
1		unfortunately , the trip to india gate restaurant in chandler was a waste of time . <sssss> the only good thing was that we had a buy one get one free coupon . <sssss> the staff stood at the bar and stared the entire meal . <sssss> they even brought us items off of the buffet ... and we did n't order the buffet . <sssss> i expected my food to be freshly prepared ... all of it . <sssss> even the naan . <sssss> maybe we hit them on a bad night . <sssss> none-the-less , we wont be back . 
1		food was way overpriced for the taste . <sssss> beans overcooked . <sssss> tortillas seemed stale . <sssss> server was horrible . <sssss> avoid this place . <sssss> dont waste ur $ . <sssss> sorry bout iiiiit . 
1		i used to love this yogurtology -lrb- see : glowing review below . -rrb- <sssss> but now ? <sssss> i 'll never be back . <sssss> over the past month and a half , i 've gone to yogurtology 3 times -lrb- i 'd be there more , but i live a solid 20 min . <sssss> away with no traffic -- but it was really that good ! -rrb- <sssss> during those 3 visits , i was treated rudely , ignored , and basically given the impression that my business was not wanted . <sssss> what happened ? <sssss> apparently , the same boy works every single day i 've gone -lrb- and yes , he 's a boy ... obviously not even out of high school -rrb- . <sssss> he 's rude , often has his friends in the shop , and is incompetent . <sssss> the high school students yogurtology used to hire were great -- there was one guy in particular who was funny , outgoing , and gave the place energy ! <sssss> but not anymore . <sssss> first time i went -- no place to sit because this kid/worker 's friends had taken all the inside spots . <sssss> not only were they taking a bunch of free samples , they were also loudly talking about how girls are all `` hoes '' and how ugly `` hoes '' are the worst -- come on , seriously ??? <sssss> in yogurtology where there are children ?? <sssss> second time -- no place to sit because this kid had n't bothered off to clean off all the sticky tables . <sssss> i literally had to eat my froyo in the car because there was no clean place to sit . <sssss> this last time -lrb- today -rrb- ? <sssss> : kid gave free samples to 3 people -lrb- a small family -rrb- standing in front of us . <sssss> when my boyfriend and i walked up to ask him about trying the ` spicy banana mango ' -lrb- because seriously , who does n't want to sample that ??? -rrb- <sssss> he ignored us and walked away behind the counter . <sssss> given all the other frozen yogurt shops closer to where i live , this is an incredibly stupid move for yogurtology . <sssss> hire some real workers and fire this clown who obviously does n't care enough to do his job right . <sssss> i will never , ever be back . 
1		was highly recommended this restaurant by client . <sssss> the service was a total miss . <sssss> the food was okay to mediocre ... . <sssss> . <sssss> way too expensive for what it is . <sssss> been to india several times for business and never seen belly dancing in india . <sssss> i asked several client friends that are indian if belly dancing is a tradition . <sssss> not one said yes . <sssss> the belly dancing was a bit annoying and felt slightly uncomfortable with my guests . <sssss> the dancer was annoyed that no one at my table appreciated it did not tip . <sssss> she just started to fling her hips closer . <sssss> i would have flung my naan at her to get the hell away from us . 
1		the name of this place is `` pete 's fish and chips '' ! <sssss> maybe it 's just me , but that should mean that their fish and chips is pretty epic ... this place is a complete fail . <sssss> quite possibly the worst fish and chips experience i have ever had . <sssss> the location is pretty dingy and has the wonderfully appetite inspiring odor of a dumpster . <sssss> but let 's focus on the food . <sssss> the fish that they have is basically a triple size fish stick ; nothing special in anyway at all . <sssss> it basically had no flavor other than the oil it was fried in . <sssss> the fries that the fish sticks were sitting on were good , which is why they get 1 star . <sssss> oh and do n't expect any ketchup to try and add some flavor to the food , they do n't carry it at all ! <sssss> and if you want something other than their vinegar dip , you 'll be paying extra for a little cup of tartar sauce . <sssss> i also ordered the onion rings , and just as a side note , i love onion rings , however these are the first onion rings that i have had that i did n't finish . <sssss> they were nasty , for lack of a better term . <sssss> they were so hard that it was like chewing on tree bark , coated in sandpaper with a flavorless worm in the center . <sssss> i 'm sure that after a night of drinking and smoking this would be the perfect ball of grease to settle my belly , but if you are looking for something tasty , or something to eat when your taste buds are fully functional , this is not it . <sssss> there are tons of other places to get fish and chips and onion rings that put this place to shame . 
1		i won a `` free '' oil change at sun devil auto through the local soccer program . <sssss> when i had the oil changed , they stripped the threads on not only the oil plug , but also on the oil pan . <sssss> their solution to the problem was to plug it with a bigger plug and said they would have to charge me to replace the pan . <sssss> the oil , however , is still leaking . <sssss> meanwhile , there is no place in town that will change my oil without me replacing the pan . <sssss> this `` free '' oil change is costing me a fortune !!! 
1		booked appointment online waste of time . <sssss> edgar the little salesman that helped was a big ... oh excuse me little jerk !!! <sssss> will never go to that location . <sssss> they act like they want to help but they just want your money and commission . 
1		unhappy , cold food . <sssss> half the time there is unfriendly clerk charging different pricing . <sssss> cheese did not even melt on rolled tacos and the guacamole is on the right side so you ca n't pick them up ! <sssss> apparently every one is left handed . <sssss> 2-3 years and still ca n't get their act together . <sssss> what a shame !!! 
1		i ate there on the day it opened for business and the food was horrible . <sssss> the chicken was so dry and tough i could n't get it off the bone . <sssss> the pizza was bland , and the rest of the food lacked the seasoning and flavors i look for in mediterranean food . <sssss> i suggest you look elsewhere for something to eat ! <sssss> i 'm sorry that the asian food is gone . <sssss> if i could give this place a zero star , i would ! <sssss> crappy , crappy food , waitstaff did n't really care -lrb- took a couple of minutes for them to seat us -rrb- , seemed like the a/c was n't working , and who wants to walk through a hookah lounge to get to a restroom that had a really bad smell ! <sssss> stay away !!!!! <sssss> a real zero star restaurant !!!!! 
1		so gross . <sssss> so , so gross . <sssss> i was n't expecting fine dining , but seriously ?! <sssss> there 's nothing `` new york '' about this shit hole , unless you count the dirty prints on the wall . <sssss> do n't waste you 're time or your money . 
1		yes , the tea is good . <sssss> great even . <sssss> but as i explained to my husband after trying a sample from a teavana employee , `` tea is inexpensive , let 's just check it out . '' <sssss> the tea i tried was $ 12 for 2 oz ... which i found out after i asked for 4 oz . <sssss> i changed my order to 2 and the female employee seemed put off . <sssss> i mentioned i brewed my loose-leaf tea in my coffee maker and she was appalled , and then tried to sell me every loose-leaf tea pot in the store . <sssss> when i said no to one she whipped out another one , all the while my husband was sitting back and laughing . <sssss> the sales associate was telling me how to do this , that and the other like i 've never prepared tea before in my life . <sssss> hello ! <sssss> if i 'm in a tea store , then i drink tea often . <sssss> $ 34 and 4 oz of tea later , i will not be returning . 
1		i 've been coming to this pita jungle off and on for a while , since i work nearby . <sssss> i ca n't figure out why everyone that works there is a jerk . <sssss> it seems to be only me - i see other people getting good service with a smile , but i 'm always `` s '' - d on whenever i come here . <sssss> today will be the last time i ever do . <sssss> great food , but the one star is for the unconscionably rude staff . <sssss> my bro-in-law and another good friend feel the same way , too , and we 're tempted to think it 's because we do n't look like we belong here , but that 's just a shot in the dark . <sssss> once or twice i 'd forgive , but every time ? <sssss> f this place , seriously . 
1		this place sucks . 
1		consistently bad ! <sssss> i 've stayed at this property a few times and dined at prado every time . <sssss> you would think i 'd learn . <sssss> food is terrible at best , service is nonexistent over 3 hrs for dinner , and crazy overpriced . <sssss> anyone who uses yelp and still goes here gets what they deserve . <sssss> went for breakfast next day . <sssss> the chef came over and spoke to us regarding our experience . <sssss> he 's trying to clean up the brand , has a lot of work ... will not go back . 
1		manager is useless and service is terrible store is clean and a nice layout but without good service their company lost another customer that spends a lot on a weekly basis for saltwater items which is a shame being their store by far has cleaner tanks than their queen creek location but staff at queen creek at least knows their stuff about saltwater products and does n't argue with the customer and overcharge you or make you wait for the aquatics guy to come in days later . <sssss> few employees special order fish and inverts for themselves put them in the display tanks then say nfs manger and staff really incompetent 
1		lots of `` gay on gay '' homophobia here . <sssss> hick bars in alabama are more gay friendly . <sssss> staff and owners know this but they do not seem to care . <sssss> oh well 
1		i told my wife not to make me come here and she did n't listen . <sssss> i waited forever for take out . <sssss> they screwed up the order beyond belief . <sssss> the staff does n't know the ingredients in their own products . <sssss> i waited 30 + minutes for them to fix an order that very explicitly said `` no cheese '' . <sssss> i brought home the wrong sandwich to my wife because they screwed up . <sssss> one tiny container of sauce for a bucket of pasta ? <sssss> disaster . <sssss> wife called back and the manager offered to remove just the sandwich . <sssss> when she asked if that was really all they were going to do , the manager said `` i do n't know what else you want me to do . '' <sssss> . <sssss> hmmmm . <sssss> how about manage the restaurant , teach employees the ingredients in your food , and provide a certain level of customer service when you colossally screw up ? <sssss> i 'm glad she finally realizes how much this place sucks because i 've known it for years . <sssss> never again . <sssss> one star is generous . 
1		do n't believe the hype ! <sssss> i heard about their `` awesome '' margaritas and decided to give them a shot before leaving arizona . <sssss> first , the bartender was an a -- hole . <sssss> i asked for the rita i 've been hearing so much about and he serves me some frozen thing with chambord . <sssss> i told myself this must not be the thing i 've heard such ravings about so decided to choke that thing down along with their sad excuse of chicken tortilla soup - which had very little cheese and chicken but plenty of broth that looked like diarrhea . <sssss> after all of this grossness i asked the bartender for the better rita that is not frozen . <sssss> he told me that their best ritas were the frozen ones . <sssss> when i heard that i got z'hell outta that place . <sssss> ca n't wait to be back home in dallas for a real rita at ojeda 's and monica 's . 
1		the only reason they got a one is because i was forced to give them a rating . <sssss> awful , horrid , totally devoid of professionalism , business ethics or competency . <sssss> four months and my storm door is still non-functioning . <sssss> three spur of the minute cancellations after i took the days off of work . <sssss> home depot lost two sales because of them . <sssss> i insisted on a refund and will purchase my doors at ace . <sssss> employees flow through this enterprise like water over a rock . <sssss> then , if you complain , you hear `` it 's not my fault ! '' <sssss> seriously ? <sssss> their motto should be `` we absolutely over-commit and under-deliver ! '' <sssss> on an upside , i believe they will very soon have a lot more time on their hands . <sssss> if you accept four months the ias a reasonable timeline , and do n't mind eating up your leave for absence of customer service and resolution of your concerns , this is your company . 
1		no customer service , to many fee 's , they sign u up and say there are no fee 's and that is not the case . 
1		all i can say is yuck . <sssss> my friend and i came here for a roller derby match tonight and it was so disappointing . <sssss> the good was that the place was packed for the match . <sssss> the bad ? <sssss> let me count the ways . <sssss> the straight out of the 80 's building design and decor was the first bad sign . <sssss> then as you begin to enter the building , you feel as though you are entering a dungeon . <sssss> but again , with so many people there , you think there has got to be some redeeming qualities . <sssss> we get inside and get some food in the `` snack bar . '' <sssss> as we waited in line , i looked around and was too terrified to touch anything . <sssss> outdated furnishings and pieces that looked as though they could n't be cleaned if you wanted to . <sssss> i bought a bottle water , soft pretzel , and order of fries . <sssss> total was $ 6 which i thought to be very reasonable . <sssss> the girl told me 3 min on the pretzel and fries . <sssss> i got the pretzel in 3 min and the fries in 15 min . <sssss> i was so pissed since the match started by then . <sssss> when i finally got my food , we went to find seats . <sssss> that was a total joke . <sssss> there were folded chairs on the rink floor in addition to the seats on the outside of the rink . <sssss> every seat was filled and people standing everywhere . <sssss> so apparently buying a ticket does not guarantee you a seat . <sssss> ridiculous . <sssss> the match was just okay . <sssss> i thought there would be more action but how much can there be when fans are sitting on the actual site of the match ? <sssss> we did n't stay for the second match , after all , who wants to stand the whole time ? <sssss> my advice ? <sssss> have low , low expectations before coming here and it shall not disappoint . 
1		yes they have a lot of beers but it 's not worth the rude staff . <sssss> go someplace else . 
1		would definately not return ! <sssss> 6 of us ate here during spring training and there was n't one good dish amongst us . <sssss> the salads were even bad . <sssss> i had the cheese walnut and fruit salad and it was flavorless , probably because it was so cold , was it kept in the fridge already prepared ? <sssss> the greek salad was uneatable . <sssss> the lobster ravioli 's were swimming in sauce , the pizza was soso . 
1		very bad food ! 
1		this place is horrible and disgusting ! <sssss> everything is gloomy and stained there was a cockroach in our room !! <sssss> please choose any other place except this one ! 
1		gone forever ... and not terribly disappointed . 
1		the talking stick it 's self is not a bad looking/running place , as for 270 ... just do a 180 and not waste your time or money . <sssss> went for a group birthday party , few of us had rooms and others drove in . <sssss> i was one not get 'n a room -lrb- strike 1 -rrb- , went online and checked out the website bout the dress code , maid sure i 'd be in -lrb- to far to changed -rrb- -lrb- strike2 -rrb- . <sssss> if you do n't have the right shirt your not getting in , i was dressed business ready , others man it in with baggy , jordan 's , and pants off their butt . <sssss> -lrb- strike3 -rrb- drinks way over priced , way to small of dance floor . 
1		i had to give this place one star , because it wont let me give it 0 stars . <sssss> well , went there to see a comedy show and was not impressed . <sssss> sure , like the folks who have rated this have said , it had an interesting ` look ' about the place . <sssss> its location was hidden , in a not so good sorta way . <sssss> would have helped to have a sign , even a temporary one , to let you know where the place is at . <sssss> beware - they do n't advertise any sort of advance pricing , even on their website . <sssss> we were summarily overcharged at the door , being misled by the fact that it would have been cheaper to get your tickets in advance - even if that means calling them on the phone from the parking lot . <sssss> the catch on that is , good luck trying that ` trick ' , as they did n't take debit/credit - take cash , lots of it . <sssss> cost us $ 40 to get in the door instead of the advertised $ 30 . <sssss> we were told twice , when we first arrived and even after i found out we got gouged , `` oh , that 's the advance price . '' <sssss> sounded to me like they have a charge for first timers . <sssss> it only goes downhill from here , so expect some turbulence . <sssss> the drinks are way over priced . <sssss> expect to pay $ 11 for a decent grey goose vodka mixer . <sssss> my girls drink was shorter than everyone elses ! <sssss> they had domestic beer ` specials ' , as well , although their ` special ' price was in line with non-happy-hour or other establishments regular price . <sssss> well , we got in and had to share a table , because they oversold the show . <sssss> i saw first hand that many of the folks who were there did n't even pay , advance or otherwise , as they do have tickets . <sssss> those ` entitled ' folks will push their way past the paying customers - so sharpen your elbows . <sssss> the girls working the door were more occupied with text messaging than keeping order among the evidently ` entitled ' and free patrons . <sssss> all in all , expect to see lots of brothers , cousins , friends , sons , daughters , and legitimates who will get in for free , and ahead of you . <sssss> i suspect , since there were n't enough chairs for everyone - they may have broken the fire code as well . <sssss> i suspect they drink for free too , which explains why the rest of us ` customers ' had to pay such outrageous prices . <sssss> the ` help ' ? <sssss> i was n't sure they had any , since we sat at our table for 2 hours and not once did anyone come by to ask if we wanted food , drinks , or even a friendly ` thanks for coming ' , ` enjoy the show ' , or ` kiss my tailpipe . ' <sssss> the rude host told us to try the food , but we did n't even have a chance to ask anyone about the food ! <sssss> they did , however , stop long enough to throw menus at us and ran off . <sssss> what help i did see , looked confused and overworked . <sssss> i did tip the frantic bartender nicely , just because i am sure the mass of ` entitled ' clientele who were there took advantage of the fact she simply worked there . <sssss> we have n't even gotten to the show yet ! <sssss> the show , which was 45 minutes late in starting , was prefaced by music that was certainly treading the noise ordinance laws . <sssss> i am not 85 years old , but please turn down the thump so we can yell at each other in a reasonable manner . <sssss> the host , they drug out of some borough in ny , was rude to the talent and slinked off to hide his face when he yanked a legitimately funny guy off the stage - totally ruining and creating an awkward mood for those of us who were there . <sssss> at this stage of the game , even though we only got half of a show we were overpriced for , we left at intermission . <sssss> in disgust , from being treated shabbily we took off . <sssss> i have never , let me stress never taken the time to write a review on any place - good or bad - so as to prevent any of you curious lookey lous from wasting your time going there . <sssss> i expected a lot more class from a place that bills itself , in their own words , `` doc 's place is a restaurant and bar featuring a jazz music lounge . <sssss> upscale , yet not formal , doc 's place emphasizes fine dining and five-star french service without the pretense . '' <sssss> ... utter bs . <sssss> suffice to say , i would have just posted `` terrible '' here , but i had to back it up . <sssss> in this day of a depressed economy and with people wanting more bang for their buck , i would suggest patronizing elsewhere . 
1		had dinner with family last sunday evening at jw marriott resort -lrb- tuscany restaurant -rrb- and was disappointed at the limited selections on the menu . <sssss> we love marriotts and usually all their restaurants are good but not this one . <sssss> the waiter did n't come back to the table often enough and the decaf coffee with desert was very weak . <sssss> the tiramisu was the worst ever , very dry . <sssss> we have stayed at many marriotts throughout the country and they are excellent . <sssss> the food tasted good but the limited menu and service lacked marriott quality . <sssss> do n't know if it 's independently run -lrb- ? -rrb- 
1		here 's how our first time at us egg went : greeted with an attitude , burnt toast , microwaved sausage , greasy potatoes , slow service ... we wo n't be back 
1		this review is for the location on elliot rd in tempe , however a lot of my comments apply to the entire chain . <sssss> i 've been to oregano 's many times since moving to the phoenix area , and up until recently it was my favorite pizza place in the valley . <sssss> however since they have changed their menu things have really seemed to go downhill . <sssss> the menu variety has been reduced drastically , many of the items that were my favorites are not even available any more -lrb- chipotle chicken club pizza , i 'm looking at you -rrb- . <sssss> no doubt this was to cut down on food cost , but the result is that a lot of the things that made oregano 's great no longer exist . <sssss> the execution of the menu items that they do have has been inconsistent for me the last three or four visits . <sssss> today at the elliot location the stuffed pizza that we ordered came out way overdone , the crust was pretty burnt . <sssss> anybody that has ordered one of these pizzas before knows that they take nearly an hour to prepare . <sssss> there was no way we were going to send it back and wait another hour for a replacement . <sssss> unfortunately issues like this seem to be becoming common for the chain . <sssss> i could go on with issues seen during previous recent visits , but the bottom line is that there are too many good pizza places around to spend any more time with this one . <sssss> i no longer recommend the chain , and probably will not return . 
1		this place makes me sad . <sssss> thingz has some pretty nice lookin ' decor but their prices are outrageous . <sssss> if i had the money i would maybe consider buying a bar stool here or something but i just ca n't see how this business is still around with our recent economy . <sssss> here is exactly what i mean . <sssss> this giant apple costs $ 425 !!!!!!!!!! <sssss> http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gosd2ufnvqdgqpb6fmut5a?select=p2aidd2yc_wlutmnje5jlg no , i 'm not kidding . <sssss> do you want a giant apple ? <sssss> i would maybe pay 10 bucks and put it in my classroom as a joke ... 
1		i wish i had better things to say . <sssss> i called in my order and they said 15 min . <sssss> 40 min later i was still waiting for my food . <sssss> i ordered jerk chicken taco , ultimate nachos and rib tips with mac and cheese and potato salad . <sssss> they forgot to give me the sides - mac and cheese and potato salad . <sssss> jerk chicken tacos and the nachos pretty much had the same grilled chicken with some kinda thai chili sauce on top . <sssss> the tortillas were n't very good . <sssss> . <sssss> and the chips were chewy . <sssss> . <sssss> its just odd to have sweet and sour sauce on top of the nachos . <sssss> . <sssss> they both were like something scraped together from whatever you 'd find in the fridge . <sssss> the rib tips were ok . <sssss> not especially good , not especially bad . <sssss> all in all , i had such high hopes for the place and they were super nice . <sssss> but the food is n't very good and it sucks that they did n't give me part of my order . <sssss> shoulda known when the door was locked and you had to enter through the store next door . 
1		terrible 
1		1 star from the vegan perspective , as they use whey -lrb- an animal protein -rrb- in most of their breads , including their white and wheat sub breads . <sssss> please drop the whey -lrb- and all other animal products -rrb- from your breads ! 
1		will never go back - first they ruin a st. john suit even after we clearly discussed how it needed to be done , and they said they were accustomed to st. john . <sssss> secondly - they promised a gift certificate for all the inconvenience and never sent it . <sssss> i asked for a linen suit to be washed and sized lightly and they dry cleaned it instead . 
1		geesh ... was waiting at the bar today with a twenty in hand ready to buy a beer behind a guy and the snotty bartender chick took care of him ... ignored me , took care of another guy and then turned and headed to the outdoor bar to check on her customers out there , finally came back in 4 minutes 12 seconds later and then had to wait on me - i was the only one who needed a drink ... she got my water and bottle of beer and then tossed the change on the bar without a word . <sssss> i left her a dollar -lrb- half of what she would have gotten -rrb- cuz i did n't have a penny handy . <sssss> service on the patio was awful too except if you count the security guy trying to wrestle my almost-empty water glass from me . <sssss> i was a server all through hs and college and know what great marginal and su ** y service is ... and this was su ** y to the max . <sssss> friends joined me and we ordered nachos ... four plates for the five of us , no setups . <sssss> stay away unless you want to deal with really bad service , obnoxious security guys and marginal food 
1		so disappointed in this event . <sssss> i 'm grateful that people are so fond of food trucks but i 'm super unhappy that i did n't get to participate in the way that i wanted . <sssss> the traffic was horrible . <sssss> did they not cap the ticket sales ? <sssss> for 25 food trucks , there were 13,000 people ? <sssss> that 's 520 people per truck - no wonder it took several hours for people to wait in line and get food ! <sssss> no normal restaurant can serve that many people . <sssss> planning was awful , parking was awful . <sssss> charging for parking , ticket entry , and food ? <sssss> wow . <sssss> dear salt river fields , next time cap the ticket sales -- maybe a few thousand at most . <sssss> charge more if you have to -lrb- clearly people are interested -rrb- . <sssss> invite more food trucks ! 
1		i 'm not quite sure exactly how i feel about this place . <sssss> i took my family -lrb- 6 ppl -rrb- there for my adult sons birthday . <sssss> the atosphere was great , the decor was very nice , but the service and the food , not so much . <sssss> first we had been waiting so long for a table that my family started getting upset that there were families coming after us who were being seated before us and they were just coming in not waiting like we were . <sssss> it was painfully obvious that the girl running the seating , was very inexperienced and they need someone with more experience . <sssss> we were finally seated after about 45 minutes and were really looking forward to having a positive experience . <sssss> well , there is always hope . <sssss> first the waitress was a bit sloppy and we felt rushed . <sssss> i use to waitress , you never ever ever rush the people you 're waiting on . <sssss> then it took about 10 minutes to get our drinks and the only people who recieved water were the people drinking alcohol . <sssss> there use to be a time that they put in on your table the minute that you sat down . <sssss> to make it short and sweet , the food . <sssss> waaaay over priced for what you get . <sssss> the appetizers were just ok . <sssss> nothing to get thrilled over . <sssss> my daughters fish was over cooked , the hawiian rice that it came with was too sweet , there was nothing balancing it out . <sssss> my sons huge black & blue burger had this little tiny bit of blue cheese on it . <sssss> my giant baked patato cost over $ 8 and the toppings were hardly enough for a mini potato . <sssss> about 5 minutes after i ordered it , i told the waitress that i had changed my mind and she told me that it was too late . <sssss> really too late to change my mind on a baked potato ? <sssss> you have got to be kidding me . <sssss> i spent almost $ 200 and left disappointed , that should never happen . 
1		if i could give it zero stars i would . <sssss> worst service i have ever had at a restaurant in my entire 29 years of life . <sssss> i was with a large group of 10 people and we ordered some beers and food -lrb- coming to an `` oyster house '' and being told they do n't recommend them on the half shell -rrb- and when we got our food the waiter got our order completely wrong and when we told her what happened instead of apologizing and offering to make it right she proceeded to tell us that was what we had ordered and that we were the ones who were wrong ! <sssss> i could n't believe my ears ! <sssss> when i politely told her again that was not what we had ordered she kept arguing with us and then just took the food and left . <sssss> i was beside myself . <sssss> i have never been treated so badly in a restaurant before . <sssss> i then asked to speak to a supervisor and she shot back that there was not a supervisor on that night . <sssss> yeah i believe that . <sssss> so we promptly left and were never not once offered one single apology , instead we were told that we were wrong and then ignored . <sssss> will never set foot in this establishment again and i hope to speak with the owner to let him/her know the level of wait staff they have representing their restaurant . 
1		skip this place and go to another gate if you have time . <sssss> if you dont have time , i would reccomend a nathan 's hotdog or something out of the trash . <sssss> the place reeked of old beer , the waitstaff seemed overwhelmed and were not too interested in making good time despite being near the gates of an airport . 
1		i live right by here and have heard all the hype on this place so me , my neighbor and my daughter just ate breakfast here . <sssss> one word-overrated . <sssss> beautiful grounds and scenery but i am rating just by the food , price , and atmosphere . <sssss> set up is a little confusing . <sssss> you order from a window and seat yourself . <sssss> i had no idea . <sssss> food is pricey and no fresh orange juice they sold tropicana . <sssss> ordered for 2 adults and a child and it was $ 32.00 . <sssss> for breakfast . <sssss> we ordered omelets , bacon , my daughter had kids french toast . <sssss> food so - so and it is not cheap . <sssss> my daughter did not like the apple crisp bacon . <sssss> i thought it was ok . <sssss> me and my friend both got omelets which were just ok . <sssss> came with a pita bread and salad and a side of fruit . <sssss> utensils outside and flies everywhere including the inside . <sssss> we can not figure out the hype here . <sssss> we would have had a better breakfast at the good egg . 
1		we always wanted to go this place due to the fact that many other hong kong chinese restaurants are really good and it seem like it was like a great authentic chinese food place to go to . <sssss> this is by far the worst place i have ever been . <sssss> i ordered the egg fu yung , it came with 3 patties , just green onions on top and gravy . <sssss> no other vegetables or other condiments like i have at other places and worst of all it was burnt . <sssss> we ordered peking pork chops and it tasted like orange chicken , try figure . <sssss> and last we ordered seafood chow fun , it was slimy and seafood was chewy , uncooked and no flavor what so ever . <sssss> the top it all off , we were not offered any other drinks , server just gave us water that tasted so bad due to the fact probably because the glass cups were not washed well as you could see other lip stains . <sssss> we all felt grossed out and sick after and my 3 year old daughter was nauseated all the way home . <sssss> me and my wife had a headache as well . <sssss> probably because , i presumed of the msg and uncooked seafood and the overcooked egg fu yung . <sssss> last , it was 105 degrees outside and i was sweating like a pig inside with there ceiling fans off and the a/c prob seem like it was set at 90 degrees . <sssss> first and last time at this place . 
1		consistently poor customer service every single time i am here . <sssss> starbucks ceo offering a free cup of coffee for all those that pay it forward to someone else during the government shutdown ... `` nope , we 're not doing that here . '' <sssss> nice . <sssss> where 's a dutch bros when you need it ? 
1		i would have never used their service if i had known they would harrass me with repeat sales phone calls . <sssss> they continue to bombard me with sales calls years after they replaced my glass even after requesting that they not call , they continue to do so . <sssss> this is very unprofessional in my opinion . <sssss> i would not recommend them based on my experience . <sssss> i have used penske glass and had great experience with them and they have not bothered me with repeat sales calls . 
1		starwood platinum member with 30 + stays in last six months . <sssss> left early for event and told front desk that toilet not working and asked that it be fixed upon return . <sssss> upon return , toilet not remedied . <sssss> called front desk and instead of fixing issue threatened to be thrown out of hotel . <sssss> by far , worst hotel experience of all time . 
1		i went to this sushi bar last week for happy hour with my mother directly after work due to rave reviews . <sssss> while the sushi was pretty good and i liked the sushi chefs , the overall customer service was horrible ! <sssss> i walked in and stood at the front and the waitress was leaning against the sushi bar across the room looking at me . <sssss> she did n't walk up to say hello , nor did she direct me to an available table . <sssss> so after standing around for a few mins i walked over to her and she looked and spoke to me like i was disturbing her . <sssss> i had to ask for a menu and she simply shook her hand towards the dining area when i asked for a table . <sssss> i eventually sat down at the sushi bar and waited for my mother , we ate , enjoyed the sushi but the salad -lrb- topped with a small strip of fake crab meat -rrb- and edamame -lrb- sp ? -rrb- <sssss> left much to be desired . <sssss> when we finished our meal , oh and no one checked on us either , we sat there for 15-20 mins and no one acknowledged us . <sssss> we were sitting right next to the kitchen doors so the waitresses had to walk past us to get to the rest of the customers . <sssss> i 'm not sure if i 'm the only customer that received this kind of treatment but i did notice the waitresses being pleasant to the people around us . <sssss> as well as walking them to available tables with menus in hand . <sssss> when we paid , i wrote a note complaining about the service and intend on speaking to the manager , but i doubt that would make any difference . <sssss> i will never visit this sushi place nor would i recommend it to my large social circle . 
1		so sad that the old sonic is not around scottsdale . <sssss> the staff use to be so nice . <sssss> i went to this sonic horrible !!!!!!!!!!!!! <sssss> no refills on drinks you have to buy another drink . <sssss> staff is not very nice and hate the drive thru . <sssss> will not go back . 
1		once you do business with these people you will receive `` reminder '' calls forever . <sssss> unless you like phone spam , stay away ! <sssss> i 've even talked to the owner and he promised he would get me off the list if i removed a negative review . <sssss> they just called again today . 
1		shame on the owners of haus murphy 's for participating in the sham of a tv show `` mystery diners ! '' <sssss> when the producers promise free publicity , and you so easily lie to the public - that is not a business i will support . <sssss> the `` manager '' under scrutiny on the show was an actor - not a relative , and not a manager . <sssss> the show , the conversations , the issues ... . <sssss> all phony . <sssss> entertainment is one thing , but . <sssss> i do not respect this at all ! 
1		slow , disorganized , and it felt like they were more interested in selling glasses , contacts and all the add-ons than the health of my eyes . <sssss> i 've worn glasses and contacts for 20 + years , and this experience was noticeably different . <sssss> i 'm sure the eye doctors are probably good ... of my two hours in their office , i saw him for 5 minutes . <sssss> the rest of my time was spent in the waiting room , with an intern , and being up sold for all the add-ons around my contact and glasses -lrb- like a used car dealer selling you the sealer wax -rrb- . <sssss> pros : solid selection of designer glasses , coffee while you wait in their lobby . <sssss> cons : slow , disorganized , limited time with actual eye doctor , seemingly focused on sales volume and turning patients . <sssss> your mileage may vary , i have definitely come to expect more from my eye doctors and their staff . 
1		food is so so . <sssss> staffs were rude . <sssss> might as well just go across the street to jason 's deli . <sssss> to add insult to injury , they overcharged us and refuse to issue partial refund . 
1		customer service should extend from the headquarters , while in transit and directly to the customers door when you are a courier service . <sssss> today at 12:20 pm -lrb- noon -rrb- i was on my way home in the ocotillo area when i end up behind an on trac van -lrb- with company log magnets on both doors -rrb- . <sssss> after following him about 1/2 mile up the road i put on my right blinker to turn , however the courier just yanked a right before me , with no blinker . <sssss> the very first stop sign we approach , i have my left blinker on , however , the van driver in front of me , neither signaled to turn nor stopped , he just coasted straight through the stop sign turning left . <sssss> after i 'd come to a complete stop at the stop sign i turned left and proceeded down the curved road that i reside on . <sssss> once the courier driver sees my car in view approaching the back of his he hit his brakes and stopped in the middle of the street -- i came to a stop as well . <sssss> he looked into his right arm rear view mirror and gave me the `` annoyed face . '' <sssss> my home was two houses up on the left , i just wanted to get home . <sssss> i made eye-contact with him thru the mirror and he threw his hands up . <sssss> i then made hand gestures to get permission to go around him . <sssss> he shook his head yes and motioned me to go around him . <sssss> i pressed my garage opener and pulled into my garage . <sssss> once in park , i went to check my mailbox to see if the rude driver was still in the street . <sssss> he was . <sssss> he got out of the van and started checking the tires -- all while in the middle of the street , no hazard lights -- then got back into van and drove away . <sssss> i 'm not sure what his problem was , but he did not drive like nor possess the mannerism of anyone i would like to have delivering parcels at my front door . <sssss> he was way too paranoid to be available to provide good customer service or to be driving the company logo-plastered van through traffic . <sssss> i would have been horrified if he were actually in route to my home today . <sssss> that would have been weird . <sssss> i do n't know who will be delivering my next parcel , but i know who it wo n't be . 
1		i 'm not one to usually complain but i was extremely dissatisfied with this location . <sssss> got ripped off big time . <sssss> make sure you listen very carefully and ask as many questions as possible . <sssss> i ca n't wait to get rid of sprint because of this !! <sssss> if you go in make sure you do not get brian ! <sssss> nice guy but he 's a scam artist only interested in getting a sale , not worried about your situation . <sssss> . 
1		i 'm really surprised at the positive reviews for this place . <sssss> i wanted to like it , being a big fan of az88 and all . <sssss> maybe i just do n't understand the need to change a winning formula . <sssss> sure , variety is nice but not in and of itself . <sssss> i found the wait staff both unhelpful and unpleasant , a very unfortunate combination . <sssss> the food was flavorless -lrb- the beet salad was right out of a can ? -rrb- <sssss> and the drinks small and pricey . <sssss> five of us rang up a $ 200 bill with a bit more than usual drinking , all in a failed attempt to find the sizzle in this dud . <sssss> i 'm all for downtown establishments but they have to meet a modicum of quality and value . <sssss> in my opinion hanny 's does not . 
1		ideal plumbing did some work on a house we just purchased . <sssss> in order for the home to be covered by insurance , we had to send in proof that a leak was repaired . <sssss> the invoice we received was so light , we could n't read it , let alone send in a copy . <sssss> we called dave at ideal and he said he would email a copy to us . <sssss> we have called 5 times , and texted him to please follow through . <sssss> he has not returned our calls and we have no proof to send to the isurance company . <sssss> very upset with this plumber ! 
1		went to mucho gusto on christmas eve with family . <sssss> it was a chilly night and we saw that it got good reviews on yelp , so we stopped in for a early visit - thought some good mexican food and a margarita would warm us up . <sssss> our wonderful plan was sabotaged by the worst hostess ever . <sssss> it was early and the place was empty . <sssss> we asked to be seated - there were 5 of us - and she proceeded to seat us at a 4 person table right next to the door -lrb- remember , it 's cold outside , there are 5 of us , and the place is completely empty -rrb- . <sssss> as she was setting us up we asked to be sat at a larger table , farther away from the door . <sssss> she gave us the death stare ! <sssss> my poor family , in from out of town , iced over by some evil control freak . <sssss> she then reluctantly sat us at another 4 top -lrb- we had to drag over another table to fit us all in -rrb- and proceeded to complain to the server -lrb- within earshot of us -rrb- about us , pointing and rolling her beady little eyes . <sssss> it was then we decided that it just was n't worth it - we left -lrb- with no apologies from any of the other staff -rrb- and went to z-tejas instead . <sssss> i would have much rather supported a local establishment , but there is no need for that kind of tude , especially on christmas eve ! 
1		was so not happy with the arizona burger with habenaro cheese . <sssss> spice level was about a 2 out of 10 was dry . <sssss> first and last time were eating there . <sssss> family of 4 2 adults and 2 children total came to $ 34 
1		very friendly service over the phone but when i walked in she treated me like me and my dog had leprosy or something . <sssss> very rude owner . <sssss> i ended up not spending $ 60 to get my dog groomed and went to petsmart where they did it for $ 40 ! 
1		they say this is a gated community which it is gated but the fence does n't go all the way around the property so anyone can easily access the property . <sssss> my car was stolen from the assigned cover parking spot . <sssss> office staff not helpful at all . 
1		if you are looking for a camera or accessories do yourself a favor and drive past ritz camera ! <sssss> after spending nearly $ 1400 on a nikon camera and having it 13 months , the staff at ritz told me that because i did n't buy their `` extended '' warranty that would not help me regarding a defect with the camera despite the fact that nikon has a 1 year manufacturers warranty . <sssss> their `` solution '' was for me to bring it in so they could send it to cris camera repair -lrb- $ 45 charge -rrb- and they would determine if it was a defect or damage caused by me . <sssss> they would n't contact nikon-i had to make the call ! <sssss> for $ 25 i took it to tempe camera and now it is heading to nikon for repair . <sssss> maybe when ritz goes bankrupt again they 'll realize that `` customer service '' still counts ! 
1		i love the food ... however service here is horrible . <sssss> outright horrible . <sssss> i have been working in this area for the past 7 months and not 1 time out of 7 was eithe my order ready or complete/correct . <sssss> yesterday i told a co-worker i would give them 1 last chance and place my order 1.5 hour in advance to the to go optin online . <sssss> guess what ... did n't get the right dressing , salad looked curly and old and there was no soup with my order . <sssss> a manager had to come out to swipe his card to see my order and yet they didnt realize my order was n't correct . <sssss> i wanted to order online for convenience , as i have only a 30 minute break . <sssss> drive out , pay , grab food and leave . <sssss> no everytime my food still needs to get ready . <sssss> 2 weeks ago my soup dropped on the floor , but the carry carton was n't folded correctly , the time before that my soad was spilled all over my food , because of the same reason . <sssss> they rush , rush and do n't pay attention to their customers . <sssss> back in march i had 1 hour lunch , sat down with 2 co-worker , no one came up to us for 20 minutes , we left our table to order to go . <sssss> it took them an other 10 minutes to notice us . <sssss> a'manager ' came rushing by to apologize ' to be oh so sorry , here have some free muffins ' and left . <sssss> 15 minutes later , they didnt know how to swipe our cards , but the ` manager ' kept looking in our direction , but did n't take any actions , i guess muffins do for any mess up . <sssss> when i filled out the online questionaire for free muffins and i gave them 1 's , it disconnected me and no code . <sssss> i will not recommend them to any of my friends . <sssss> i will not go bacck here for my lunch . <sssss> 1 mess up can be forgiven , but 6 out of 7 -lrb- !!! -rrb- <sssss> no , no . <sssss> i am done . <sssss> i heard jason 's deli across the street has great salads ... . <sssss> . 
1		a walgreens with no liquor ? <sssss> what am i , in utah ? 
1		i really do not like burger king ... you have to wait for food way too long . <sssss> i sat there when there were only about 4 other customers and waited for my meal for over 20 minutes . <sssss> then , when it finally came , it was disgusting . <sssss> i got the original chicken sandwich , which i ended up throwing away . <sssss> the bread was soggy , the chicken was grayish , and the lettuce was warm and wilted . <sssss> i 'm not a mcdonalds fan , but would definitely eat there instead of burger king . <sssss> long wait , unsanitary restaurant , and gross food ? <sssss> two thumbs down . 
1		i have been gassing up here at least 1x a week the past few years . <sssss> very convenient location for me . <sssss> i even use the drive thru car wash which usually did a great job . <sssss> the last time i went thru the car wash , my car came out sopping wet . <sssss> i keep a towel in my car and jumped out to wipe it down . <sssss> out of town i had to drive away and decided to come back the next day and ask for a refund . <sssss> the clerk said she would have to ask the manager and came back to say they couldnt offer me a refund because i didnt announce there was a problem until the following day . <sssss> no one even went outside to look at my car and survey the situation . <sssss> this happened about 3 months ago and i have never returned since . <sssss> if they dont want to refund me a measly $ 8 for a shitty carwash , i certainly wont be spending $ 60 + / week to fill up my tank . 
1		this review is based off the new goodyear location -lrb- pebble creek and mcdowell -rrb- they have only been open couple weeks new so no yelp page is made for them yet i guess . <sssss> but my family and i ate there last night 12/2/13 for my fiancés birthday and my dad got food poisoning for the roasted chicken . <sssss> he was violently sick all last night and into today . <sssss> he ended going to the doctor and the doctor did confirm food poisoning . <sssss> we did check the left over chicken in the refrigerator we had brought home and the chicken was very red . <sssss> make sure the chicken is cooked !!! <sssss> will never order chicken here !! <sssss> and probably will not be a top choice of restaurants to eat at in my neighborhood . <sssss> again this is for the goodyear location . 
1		i 'm pissed . <sssss> surprised ... and pissed . <sssss> what the hell happened to orange table !? <sssss> my boyfriend and i stopped for breakfast on sunday and experienced the worst service i think that i have had anywhere ! <sssss> we ordered breakfast . <sssss> after waiting 25 minutes -lrb- for eggs , people ... eggs ... this is not a big deal -rrb- , i went inside -lrb- because the waiter was not conscientious enough to come to us -rrb- to ask if there was a problem with our order . <sssss> the response was , and i quote , `` the kitchen is backed up ; it should be out in a few minutes . '' <sssss> note : there was no apology for the wait , and no effort to appease me . <sssss> after waiting another 10 minutes , a waitress came by and asked generally if we were having a good day . <sssss> when we said that we would feel better about our day if we were able to get our food , the response was , and i quote : `` have n't you ever been here on the weekend . <sssss> we are always slow on the weekend . '' <sssss> are you friggin ' kidding me !!!? <sssss> this is an appropriate response !? <sssss> again , no apology . <sssss> no offer of coffee or roll or something while we wait . <sssss> and is slow service ever an acceptable policy !? <sssss> a few more minutes went by ; my boyfriend and i stood up to leave just as our food was coming . <sssss> we even said to the waiter , `` we were just going to leave . '' <sssss> no response . <sssss> none ! <sssss> could n't friggin ' believe it . <sssss> i used to tell everyone about this place . <sssss> no more . 
1		i would give a negative star rating if i could . <sssss> do not shop here unless you want your money tied up for over a month with a lot of hassle and no reward in the end . <sssss> i purchased a sofa and loveseat on 11/24 . <sssss> shopping there was an experience in itself . <sssss> i believe someone else has mentioned their sales staff is odd and i would agree with that . <sssss> there seems to be a machismo mentality here . <sssss> even though i -lrb- a female -rrb- was purchasing the furniture , the salesman insisted on acting like i was n't there and pretty much just spoke to my boyfriend . <sssss> he made sure my bf 's phone # was provided . <sssss> i 'm assuming so they did n't have to deal with me later on down the road ? <sssss> it was written on my sales receipt that it would be 5-10 working days for delivery for a `` special order '' . <sssss> we were informed the sofas were coming from california . <sssss> after 10 business days we had not heard anything from the company , so i called on a saturday to see what was up . <sssss> i was told the warehouse was closed on saturdays so i would get a call back monday by noon . <sssss> monday at noon came and went and i heard nothing -lrb- this became a pattern -rrb- . <sssss> when i called them , i was told the sofas were on the truck for delivery -lrb- yet no one ever called to set up a delivery time -rrb- ; however , they had two sofas , not a sofa and loveseat . <sssss> would i like to just take the two sofas instead ? <sssss> as any consumer out there , i purchased a sofa and a loveseat for a reason . <sssss> the options given to me were to have the sofa delivered that week and the loveseat delivered whenever it came in or take the two sofas . <sssss> i opted to not take any delivery until they had what i had originally purchased . <sssss> i asked when i should expect the loveseat and i was rudely told that the warehouse was just faxed and i would be called when they knew . <sssss> he acted as if i was greatly inconveniencing him . <sssss> of course , i never did receive a phone call back . <sssss> my bf took over the phone calls after this because i was not going to be able to hold it together dealing with them anymore . <sssss> over the next month + he continually called them to determine when we should expect delivery and they continually pushed him off ... no calls back as usual . <sssss> finally he asked for our delivery charge to be refunded back , which they surprisingly did credit back very quickly . <sssss> along with that refund he also asked for a definite date of delivery because we were tired of playing these games . <sssss> they gave us a one week delivery date because it was christmas time and they were expecting rain in california -lrb- apparently the drivers ca n't drive in the rain ? -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> that one week of course came and went without any word from the company . <sssss> the bf called the following day to find out where our furniture was and he was told they still do n't have it . <sssss> he finally asked to cancel the order and they put up a little bit of a fight , but after being told that we have been provided three different delivery dates that never have panned out along with no calls back , they gave in . <sssss> unfortunately , i waited for a week and never received a credit back . <sssss> so ... the bf called once again . <sssss> when he did , he was told `` great news '' , they can now provide us a delivery date ! <sssss> he explained that he actually canceled the order a week ago and we have already made other plans . <sssss> we just need our money credited back . <sssss> they said the note they have on the account indicates we had asked for a $ 100 credit , not to cancel the order . <sssss> instead of believing the customer , they had to find the person the bf had spoken to a week ago to confirm the cancellation . <sssss> finally they agreed to cancel the order ; however , they needed my credit card info to do the credit . <sssss> this greatly confused me because they just credited us the delivery charge without needing any information ? <sssss> unfortunately i was not around to give the info , so we were going to call back the next day . <sssss> the bf asked if they still had my info on file and they said they do not keep that information . <sssss> that makes sense when they have n't even delivered our merchandise yet ? <sssss> in summary , this is a very shady place . <sssss> do not even waste your energy . 
1		i went to the location they have in central phoenix , as a court ordered referral for some trouble i had gotten into several months ago and truthfully this place is a joke . <sssss> hands down they could care less about the individual and are only interested in the mighty dollar , i would suggest that the state revokes the doctor 's that work here license for the fact that their code of ethics are garbage . <sssss> you truly are a number here . <sssss> i would not suggest that anyone ever tries this place out . <sssss> go somewhere else ... seriously !!! <sssss> the only person in this whole place who was friendly was the receptionist . <sssss> i would give this place negative 1000 stars and pray that it gets struck by lightning it sucks so bad . <sssss> i went back to the courts for another referral this place was so bad . <sssss> i would rather sit in front of the judge in the central court system and deal with a wonderful additional date in court then be forced to participate in any out patient program this business has to offer , which i did so i could go some where else . <sssss> i would rather have hot metal spikes shoved in my urinary tract then go to this place . <sssss> i hope this convinces you how much this place sucks . 
1		i came in to kohls looking for men 's dress shoes for work . <sssss> while searching , i opened one box of shoes and they had clearly been worn and returned , and there was a foul odor . <sssss> this was n't foot odor , no there was dog feces still on the bottom of these shoes in the box . <sssss> how did the customer service people not catch this during the return ? <sssss> i did eventually find a pair i wanted . <sssss> i get in line for the single cashier that was working . <sssss> having been to kohls recently i knew that they offer a discount on your purchase if you apply for credit . <sssss> well everyone decided to apply for the discount that day , and as you know filing out a credit application takes quite a while . <sssss> this is really not a great system as it holds up the line anytime someone agrees to apply . <sssss> so eventually after a long , long wait the manager brought in another cashier to speed things along . <sssss> i had a coupon in passbook on my iphone for 25 % off . <sssss> i show the cashier the coupon and she looked very confused . <sssss> she pondered it for a moment and decided that it must be a 3rd party coupon , and that they do n't accept 3rd party coupons . <sssss> i ask her to please try to scan it anyway as it came from kohls.com but she decided that this new `` smartphone '' thing was too scary and to not even try . <sssss> after asking a second time i gave up and paid the full price . <sssss> all she had to do was just try to scan it or key in the number and i would have been happy , but no , she has to rudely tell me no . <sssss> customer service is a foreign concept to these people . <sssss> i will never be back . 
1		i went down to enjoy a gift card from here and it was n't open , their door hours said they should of been and their website said they should of . <sssss> i went at 1230pm ?? <sssss> very poor business ! <sssss> i have a 50 $ gift card to here ... not even sure i want to try this place out now . 
1		i went to rudy 's full of excitement and empty of belly . <sssss> i was more excited when i saw the real , shared-table , waxed-paper barbecue joint ambiance and the tubs full of iced beer . <sssss> an hour later -lrb- half of that standing in line -rrb- , i came away empty of excitement and wallet , and only marginally more full of belly . <sssss> why , you might ask ? <sssss> because i 've ruined barbecue in my own back yard that tasted better than the what they passed off as bbq last night at rudy 's . <sssss> the meat was tender , to be sure , but there was more smoke in my clothes when i left than there was in the pork ribs or sausage we got . <sssss> if anybody 's mother used to broil ribs in the oven when they were kids , well ... that 's pretty much what you 'll get here , except it would be as if she accidentally spilled the entire pepper grinder on them first , because the meat rub at rudy 's consisted of an overpowering application of black pepper , and pretty much nothing else . <sssss> i did n't get any of the brisket , but it looked delicious , so before i left i asked the guys at the next table how theirs was . <sssss> one of them said `` it 's good , it tastes just like corned beef , and i love corned beef '' . <sssss> now -- hold the dang phone ! <sssss> the fact that this guy likened his brisket to corned beef , which is brisket , but peppered instead of smoked , should tell you all you need to know about how weak this joint is when it comes to producing actual barbecue . <sssss> it should not be possible to confuse barbecued beef brisket with corned beef , but if there 's no smoke in the brisket , i suppose that 's what you get . <sssss> and if there 's no smoke in it , my friends , then it is n't barbecue . <sssss> i was so perplexed by it all , i actually called their management the next day , told them of my experience , and asked them if they thought they were having an off night or if virtually smokeless and over-peppered was just the way it was meant to be . <sssss> they confessed to no off night that they were aware of , and said everybody loves it , and they hope i come back . <sssss> sorry guys and gals ... not on your life . <sssss> as they say in texas , this place is `` all hat and no talent . '' <sssss> i do n't understand what the fuss is about . <sssss> texans should know better than to call this stuff barbecue , and so should everybody who knows what real barbecue is . 
1		so i have been shopping here for the last couple of years , basically since they have opened . <sssss> i have spent hundreds , maybe thousands in that time on knives , camping gear , fishing equipment , etc. . <sssss> however i have just recently became involved in shotguns and firearms . <sssss> the last 2 visits were the last 2 i will make to the store . <sssss> went in to ask about a pistol and the old short white haired guy was stuck up and arrogant and even laughed at one of my questions . <sssss> at that point i just walked away . <sssss> went in yesterday for some 12 ga. . <sssss> ammo . <sssss> stood in line in the firearms area for 20 minutes !! <sssss> just to ask their opinion on some hd shells . <sssss> was met with the overall `` i 'm too busy just to answer questions '' type of attitude from everyone . <sssss> i will take my business now to cabelas , dicks , big 5 , even ctd in texas before bass pro shop get another penny from me . 
1		i went here for lunch thinking that it would be the same pho in oakland , ca and boy i was wrong !!! <sssss> the restaurant looked much nicer and modernize but thumbs down for the food . <sssss> i ordered the rice plate with chicken , shredded pork and egg cake . <sssss> the only thing that tasted okay was the shredded pork . <sssss> the chicken and egg cake were so bland , i had to put a lot of fish sauce which i hate . <sssss> therefore , ended up not eating it . <sssss> i ended up ordering a small pho to be safe , did n't want to eat much carbs haaa . <sssss> boy the pho was such a disappointment , the broth had no flavor . <sssss> no thanks to this restaurant ! 
1		had got a groupon tried to make an appointment the guy who answered was a real ass !! <sssss> and they do n't give there names when they answer the phone . <sssss> -lrb- maybe if he does n't like his job he should find another one -rrb- i advised that i had tried to call but keep getting a message `` if you know your parties extension please enter it now or if you need to hear ur options press 0 i would hit 0 and it would ask for an extension . <sssss> after several attempts of calling i booked on line . <sssss> the guy told me there was no appointments that day , i said but i booked 1 on line he told me oh the online does not mean there 's appointments , that does not match our real time schedule . <sssss> -lrb- really then why do appointments online -rrb- also the online booking says u will get a confirmation call with in 24hrs well i never got a call . <sssss> he told me they have no appointments at all until dec 23 or dec 24 . <sssss> if people are that rude on the phone i can only imagine what the office staff are like . <sssss> i would hope they are nicer 
1		messed up on all three things i ordered and they did n't care , when i mentioned it . 
1		will never go here again . <sssss> food was cold and overpriced for what we got . <sssss> they were out of a lot of their sides and when i asked kfc to contact me via their website they never did . <sssss> i 'm not a person that sends back food and when i have bad service i try to assume they are busy or it 's just an off day . <sssss> but in this case avoid at all costs . 
1		if i could give this pharmacy zero stars i would have . <sssss> my husband went in to use their shipping services and the lady with short hair was completely rude . <sssss> she stated , `` that you are raping us of our shipping supplies '' . <sssss> the term `` rape '' was used . <sssss> wow ! <sssss> he was using usps shipping material and shipping it from their store . <sssss> usps offers these flat rate shipping boxes as a means to ship priority . <sssss> meaning we are paying for the services . <sssss> i would hope management of this pharmacy get extra help . <sssss> with employees like these they may go out of business . <sssss> i would not recommend their service to anyone . <sssss> do not come here if you are looking for customer service . <sssss> i am appalled with her behavior and the pharmacy 's service . 
1		ive been having my car serviced here for 6 years . <sssss> the last time they failed to tighten any of the lug nuts on one of the wheels after a tire rotation . <sssss> i drove away and nearly crashed . <sssss> i had to call them to tell them to come out and tighten the wheel as it was barely on the car . <sssss> i never received an apology , an admission of guilt ... when i called them the next day , they said they could perhaps give me a free oil change . <sssss> really ?!? <sssss> my days with them are over . <sssss> they are careless and do not take ownership of their mistakes . <sssss> zero customer service ! 
1		smaller sizes ... not much for the plus or large crowd . <sssss> also , the staff is almost incredulously rude everytime i 'm in here ! <sssss> i know people love it here , but it 's like a very expensive goodwill . <sssss> the clothes and accessories are way overpriced for what you 're getting ! <sssss> save yourself some money and go down to the goodwill at 16th st and indian school . <sssss> also , if you have clothes to sell , do n't get your hopes up . <sssss> gawd knows i 've tried to figure out what they are looking for ... when they did take a couple of my smaller size 12 sundresses to consign , they ended up giving them away to a thrift store for dogs -lrb- i shit you not -rrb- and did n't even bother to call me . <sssss> i guess that 's not their policy ... if you consign here and they do n't sell your stuff in whatever time frame they think they should , do n't expect to ever get it back . 
1		called ellsworth home services for there `` so called '' free tune up and all the guy was trying to do was sell me parts that i found out by another company that i did not need . <sssss> also ellsworth home services has only been in business less than three years which tech told me 10 years . <sssss> beware !! 
1		this is my least favorite bar that i have been to in old town for one main reason . <sssss> the music is too loud !! <sssss> what is that ?? <sssss> the music is tooooo loouuudddd !! <sssss> i ca n't hear you ?? <sssss> whatttt ?? <sssss> huhhh ?? <sssss> -lrb- hand gesture to the door -rrb- and you leave . <sssss> the biggest joke i was told was that this is the '' # 1 lounge in scottsdale '' . <sssss> there is no way that is the case . <sssss> i ca n't stand this spot . <sssss> the bartenders are good , but they ca n't even hear your order . <sssss> i have yet to have a good time here , and do n't think much about coming back to this spot ... even if it is busy . 
1		reluctantly returned to the fillmore vig for a mandatory office christmas party . <sssss> the service was better this time being in a large group , but the food was severely lacking . <sssss> our `` spread '' consisted of a fruit tray resembling something you could pick up at costco , bland hummus and cold pita bread , and something i believe was intended to be sandwiches but really they were just 5 inch thick buttered buns cut in half with something unrecognizable slapped in between . <sssss> again , very bland . <sssss> i have yet to figure out what everyone loves about the vig . <sssss> there were heat lamps out on the patio so scorchingly hot i thought my flesh was melting off of my face standing 2 feet away . <sssss> the only positive thing i can say is that the wine/drinks were decent . 
1		we bought these lights at the star of the south dental meeting in houston . <sssss> what a giant mess ! <sssss> long story short is : took forever to get , contained no magnetic attachments , waited forever to get attachments , decided to return items within our 45 day trial period & guess what ? <sssss> they are not giving us our money back . <sssss> i have been fighting with them for a month & even have taken out a dispute with the credit card company . <sssss> he is even fighting with the credit card comany about returning our money . <sssss> the owner , ray nguyen , has not been an ethical business person at all and everyone should avoid at all costs . <sssss> i will also be contacting the star of the south dental meeting comittee & the texas dental association . 
1		this is one place that desperately needs the trademark korean restaurant table beepers . <sssss> ignored for a good 40 minutes in a half empty restaurant . <sssss> received drinks after 45 good company made it bearable servers were disinterested they follow the 80/20 rule in serving 80 % of service to 20 % of the tables . <sssss> did n't replace grill racks did n't replace banchan until we asked 20 min later same for rice not even a hi all dinner service invisible man service style lotsa hairs in potato salad waiter just shrugged and said yea -lrb- at this point it was just like grinding it out for the meal to end , the latino waiter who seemed like the only person in the restaurant really trying to serve people seemed pretty sad too by this discovery . -rrb- <sssss> waited for bill ... another 20 min asked for a split check , lotsa sighs just disappointing when i came here last year with koreans we got the polar opposite in terms of treatment . <sssss> at least the food was n't as underwhelming as the service . <sssss> it 's sorta sad people are rating this place so high esp with the price premium they charge ... have they never been to so-cal korean bbq , or heck even chodang ? <sssss> and sushi at takamatsu is pretty op -lrb- as in overpriced -rrb- too since other people mentioned high great of a deal the sushi here was . <sssss> coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties ca n't wait for the other person to ask to break up . <sssss> ** came back a second time a week later and the service was just as bad . <sssss> no service really and my friend had to yell and wave to get scissors after waiting 20 min . <sssss> charging 18 % gratuity to serve ourselves and not get refills of banchan makes me cry a little inside . 
1		at comerica theater , -lsb- insert your fav band name here -rsb- will sound like thump thump thump , muffle muffle thump . <sssss> worst acoustics ever in a `` theater '' style venue . <sssss> it 's too bad phoenix does n't have a good medium sized venue for popular acts . <sssss> i have seen dcfc and arcade fire at comerica . <sssss> these acts would have been great but the sound/acoustics were terrible . <sssss> i have gone back hoping it was just an isolated show , but nope . <sssss> comerica sounds bad bad bad . 
1		ok ... so here 's the deal . <sssss> you know a place is bad when i feel compelled to share my bad experience with the world . <sssss> i feel horrible doing this , but i mean come on ! <sssss> not only was the food some of the worst i 've ever had -lrb- and i have had really bad food -rrb- . <sssss> but what got me more then the horrible food , was the service . <sssss> i sat outside for 15 minutes before i went in to get someone , than it took another 10 for her to come out . <sssss> all the while i had a server that was sitting down talking to a table . <sssss> the food was cold , service was slow , and it was not worth the money . <sssss> i vow to never go there again ! <sssss> there are so many other great places at tempe market place . 
1		groupon groupies beware !!!! <sssss> good luck getting a simple oil change at this location . <sssss> i 'm cheap so i want to use my groupon for 3 oil changes . <sssss> first they ask that you call in first thing each day in the morning which i did , several times , same answer `` were booked '' but if you drop your car we will get to it . <sssss> so i finally decided to drive there and drop my vehicle off , this time the guy said , oh , we are not taking any more today . <sssss> wtf ? <sssss> so i asked how long does it normally take if they do take my car . <sssss> answer : 1 to 3 hours . <sssss> really ? <sssss> for an oil change ? <sssss> btw i drive a car not a semi . <sssss> hopefully groupon can refund my $ $ from this jokers . 
1		very poor service , could n't get clean silverware to save my soul . <sssss> food was fair . 
1		well first off this happened a few months ago . <sssss> i decided to get some mexican for lunch and garcia 's was in the mall where i work . <sssss> we placed our order and the food came out a little late . <sssss> so we asked to get it to go , the waiter literally said `` are you f ** king kidding me ? '' <sssss> i was very surprised and told him `` yes i 'm f ** cking serious '' . <sssss> how are you going to use that language towards a customer . <sssss> i was late getting back to work because they took their sweet time packing it up . <sssss> it was n't just the one server , the entire staff are a bunch of dicks . <sssss> i 'm never going there again . 
1		i am actually horrified this place is still in business . <sssss> my 3 year old son needed a haircut this past summer and the lure of the $ 7 kids cut signs got me in the door . <sssss> we had to wait a few minutes as both stylists were working on people . <sssss> the decor in this place is total garbage . <sssss> it is so tacky . <sssss> the sofa they had at the time was a pleather sofa with giant holes in it . <sssss> and my son noticed ants crawling all over the floor and the furniture . <sssss> it was disgusting and i should have walked out then . <sssss> actually , i should have turned around and walked out upon entering but i did n't . <sssss> so the older black male stylist finishes the haircut he was doing and it 's our turn . <sssss> i tell him i want a # 2 clipper around the back and sides and then hand cut the top into a standard boys cut . <sssss> really freaking simple , right ? <sssss> wrong ! <sssss> rather than use the clippers and go up to actually cut the hair , he went down . <sssss> using it moving downward does n't cut hair , it just rubs against it . <sssss> how does this man who has an alleged cosmetology license not know how to use a set of freaking clippers ??? <sssss> i realized almost immediately that he had no idea what he was doing . <sssss> no idea at all . <sssss> after about 10 minutes of watching this guy stumble through it , i said `` you know what ? <sssss> that 's fine . '' <sssss> , paid and left . <sssss> all i wanted to do was get out of that scummy joint and take my son to a real haircut place . <sssss> bottom line : do not go here . <sssss> run the other way !!!!! 
1		i want to start by saying i 've spent thousands at lowes in the past 8 months of living in my new home , my average lowes shopping trip is between $ 300 - $ 800 dollars . <sssss> tonight , i showed up at lowes literally at 7:59 , a minute before closing . <sssss> i asked an employee who was in the parking lot -lrb- wish i got his name , he was a great guy , bald w / a goatee -rrb- what time they were closing tonight , and he told me 8:00 pm , and i replied that i did n't want to be `` the guy that rushes in last minute , and that i would be back tomorrow '' . <sssss> he was super nice , and assured me it was n't a problem at all , that i came all this way i should do my shopping and make the trip worth while . <sssss> i thanked him and walked toward the entrance . <sssss> a female employee walked out of the entrance to throw something in the trash can that was just outside the entrance , but saw me walking up and very quickly scurried back in side and forced the doors shut with her hands and locked it quickly , literally as i was about to enter through the doors . <sssss> she did n't say a word , just looked at me in the face as she locked the door and walked away , as i could hear her loudly asking another employee `` is that against policy ? '' <sssss> i was so shocked that she did n't even care enough to at least tell me , sorry we are closing , or we are closed sir , or anything at all for that matter , and that she just slammed the doors shut and locked them as if i was a stray dog or something . <sssss> the gentleman employee that was in the parking lot saw what happened , and was extremely caring , he opened the doors for me and let me do my shopping which took me 6 mins , as there were still customers in the store . <sssss> i rated this lowes the lowest rating possible so everyone can read this review , but that employee who cared enough to let me do my unintentional `` last minute '' shopping is the only reason that i will continue to shop at lowes and not spend the thousands of dollars a year at home depot , if that guy did n't go out of his way to let me in the store , this heartless woman would 've cost lowes a loyal , frequent customer , and a good amount of lost revenue . <sssss> i will try to find the guys name and update my review . <sssss> thanks ! 
1		while i agree that the layout nof this store is better , i waited for this store to reopen as i generally love ace hardware stores . <sssss> today i went to buy a 25 lb bag of salt for my water softner as the grocery store was out of it . <sssss> well ... not only was there no one in the store , but i had a hard time finding someone to help me . <sssss> when i checked out , the cashier was rude . <sssss> when i told her that this salt did not cost $ 19.95 a bag !!! <sssss> however they did charge me $ 10.75 !!! <sssss> that is more than twice the price at the grocery store . <sssss> the girl was insistant she was right and when she found out she had made an error , she talked under her breath to me . <sssss> well , there are many other stores in this town , i will wait for the grocery store to get it in if they are out and pay $ 3.69 for the same product . <sssss> sorry , i was excited to see this store reopen but i wo n't be back.i love to support local business just not this one . 
1		this is an overpriced tourist trap filled with chain everything ... the only thing that i liked about this place was that it was attached to jobing.com arena , cardinal stadium and they had outdoor entertainment -lrb- performers -rrb- ... ohhh and the cremation advertisement was pretty funny as well . <sssss> if you want to go to a game here parking is partially free during games . <sssss> however in some areas it is $ 25 or more !!! <sssss> yeah i was totally surprised by this ... so if you show up early , its free , if you dont you pay ! <sssss> this mall is multiple stories of restaurants , shops , a theater , and who knows what all else . <sssss> pro tip : avoid this place unless you are going to a game here ... this place is also good for one last thing , people watching . <sssss> i was laughing pretty hard as a couple of girls wearing lingerie and fishnets strolled by on their way to a bar . <sssss> what was super funny was they were not the type of ladies you would want to see wearing lingerie and fishnets out and about in public . <sssss> perhaps this is the only city around where this is not out of the norm and no one , i repeat no one did a double take . <sssss> seriously phoenix and its surrounds are super unique and have some very humerus moments to say the least . <sssss> so keep your eyes peeled if you come here and if not , count yourself pretty dayem smart ... the restaurant i went to here really sucked as well ... 
1		i 'm perplexed by all of the 4 + star reviews for this restaurant . <sssss> we were seated on the patio , which was nice . <sssss> the food was not impressive at all . <sssss> the pollo fundido that everyone raves about was dry and there was n't enough of the jalapeno cream sauce . <sssss> i was dissapointed that when my daughter found hair in her food , they still charged us for the meal because they remade her plate . <sssss> the problem however , was my daughter had lost her appetite from seeing the hair and could n't eat her food anyways . <sssss> my husband ordered the lamb stew . <sssss> the sauce was seasoned well , but the lamb was very dry , just like my plate . <sssss> this restaurant was packed , so people must have good experiences here , but as for our family , we wo n't go back . 
1		oh dear , what can the matter be ? <sssss> everything !!! <sssss> what a train wreck of an experience . <sssss> first , very difficult to find . <sssss> unfortunately , we found it . <sssss> the place was empty at 7:30 while all other nearby borgata restaurants were full . <sssss> that should have been a clue . <sssss> had a deal chicken certificate so we had one appetizer , two entrees and two non-alcoholic beverages . <sssss> appetizer was an overly toasted cardboard-like english muffin with some cream cheese , avocado and sundried tomato . <sssss> they said bella ! <sssss> bella ! <sssss> bella . <sssss> i say , insipid . <sssss> raspberry lassi drink was good but strawberry spritzer was not . <sssss> two glasses of warm water were delivered . <sssss> i asked about ice and waitress said she 'd see if they had any . <sssss> had any ? <sssss> really ? <sssss> salmon entree sounded good on menu but they were out . <sssss> tilapia sounded good but they had no tilapia and were substituting sole which was very fishy smelling and tasting . <sssss> supposed to be served with millet but they were out and substituted brown rice which looked like a very pale , pasty , tasteless grool . <sssss> single fork wrapped in paper napkin . <sssss> no spoon , no knife , no salt/pepper on table . <sssss> sign on door written in crayon said that there might be some delays since four staff left suddenly . <sssss> smart people . <sssss> they abandoned ship before the sinking . <sssss> glad i used the deal chicken certificate now because if i waited much longer they will surely be deservedly dark . <sssss> ca n't remember laughing so much and so hard over such a terrible dining experience . 
1		i have no idea why this place is getting such great reviews in new-times . <sssss> this place blows . <sssss> we went there expecting to see some of the amazingness that everyone keeps talking about -lrb- and for my birthday , too . <sssss> so that was retarded -rrb- , but all it was was a bunch of brokers and douches and realtors and businesswomen looking hook up and thinking they were awesome and better than everyone else . <sssss> i do n't think i 've ever seen so many pretentious pricks in one place -lrb- except maybe at merc bar or any club in scottsdale -rrb- . <sssss> the food was n't great , but not horrible . <sssss> the drinks were actually reasonably priced , but the douche-factor made it seem like we were paying top dollar . <sssss> i guess the place is supposed to be somewhat historic -lrb- which is their one selling point , even though pretty much the only original historic piece is the sign painted on the building featured in all their promotional material -rrb- , but it just seems like they gutted the inside completely and threw the history away -- building a `` new '' dwelling place for fakey scottsdale cougars with spray-on tans looking to score with random 36-year-old investor douchebags bragging about making their first `` mil '' . <sssss> the overpriced , snotty furniture was in my face like a big disgrace and when i came home , my mom got scared , and said you 're moving with your auntie and your uncle in bel-air . <sssss> i whistled for a cab and when it came near , the license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror . <sssss> if anything i could say that this cab was rare but i thought , `` nah , forget it . <sssss> yo homes . <sssss> . <sssss> to bel-air ! '' <sssss> i. . <sssss> . <sssss> pulled ... up to the house at about 7 or 8 and i yelled to the cabby `` yo homes , smell ya later ! '' <sssss> i looked at my kingdom , i was finally there -- to settle my throne as the prince of bel-air . 
1		so , i read the great reviews on yelp and when a friend suggested going here i was all over it ! <sssss> yes , let 's go do vintage ! <sssss> so we get to hollywood regency vintage and are overwhelmed with the selection of really cool vintage items . <sssss> there was an excellent selection of vintage jewelry and cool things rarely seen elsewhere like lipstick holders and little tin containers to `` hide '' hairspray under ... and i was impressed . <sssss> the woman who is the owner seemed very helpful and friendly ... however , upon commenting on a gorgeous dress in the back room , the sales associate working said to us `` yes , you think prom with that one ... but i had a woman ` of a certain age ' try it on and she looked pretty good in it too . '' <sssss> -lrb- she exaggerated it and meant old ! -rrb- <sssss> then she turns to my friend who is one of the youngest looking , beautiful women i know , -lrb- who looked about the same age as this sales associate -rrb- and says : `` i think you might look nice in it as you are about the same age she was . '' <sssss> really ? <sssss> really ? <sssss> she said that ? <sssss> about a customer ??? <sssss> did she forget in less than a minute that she called the other customer ancient ? <sssss> -lrb- she was dressed like a fifties lucille ball and maybe that kind of thing was said in the 50 's ?? <sssss> so my friend looks at me and says in the nicest way : `` so , i think i 'm done here , you ? '' <sssss> and we left . <sssss> i have worked in customer service and retail management for years and have never heard such a thing said to a customer . <sssss> wow ! <sssss> ~ needless to say i will not be back . <sssss> really ? 
1		we had friends in town from out of state and wanted to take them to corleone 's since it was one of our favorite casual restaurants . <sssss> we were there on july 12 , 2010 around 1:30 pm or 2:00 pm . <sssss> when we walked in the door , we were given the spiel about how much better corleone 's is than other cheesesteak places . <sssss> he -lrb- the manager -rrb- even went as far as to put down the other corleone 's restaurant on 16th street and camelback in phoenix that we frequent quite often , like at least weekly sometimes a couple times a week . <sssss> keith -lrb- or so he said that was his name -rrb- , the manager , proceeded to make cocaine and drug references about the food . <sssss> saying that his creation flies out the door like cocaine , good drugs and gold bars . <sssss> after we stated that we did n't appreciate the drug and cocaine references because we had a 14 year old girl with us , he proceeded to make an inappropriate remark about her looking more `` mature '' than a 14 year old girl . <sssss> one of us left with the 14 year old and her mother . <sssss> when asked who the manager was , he told us that he was and tried to shake hands . <sssss> after refusing to shake his hand and starting to walk out the door , he said and do n't ever grace my door again ... no problem , we would never go back . <sssss> it 's sad that a person like this can ruin a very good restaurant for more than one location but i am seriously considering never going to another corleone 's since someone like that can be a manager . 
1		these people have no idea what they are doing . <sssss> as a person who has grown up eating the best bbq -lrb- meaning chopped/pulled , seasoned pork shoulder -rrb- in the us -lrb- in eastern north carolina -rrb- , of course i am going to be a tough sell . <sssss> but i was open and very disappointed . <sssss> the meat on the pulled pork sandwich was not pulled at all , but rather sliced and in chunks . <sssss> further to that , it was dry and tasted like it had been cooked over a gasoline flame . <sssss> yuk ! <sssss> this place is great if you have no idea what the offerings are supposed to taste like . <sssss> i feel bad as i write this review , because the proprietors and staff are so nice ! <sssss> but between the dry chunks of gasoline flavored pork and the spoiled sweet tea , do n't waste your time . 
1		excuse my language but this place is such a massive shithole . <sssss> have n't been to wal-mart in a few years because well , why would you ? <sssss> finally went to this one last night by request of someone i know and i just could n't take it after a few minutes , i left my cart down some isle and booked it as fast as i could out of there . <sssss> sorry , i just ca n't take the people sitting on the floor everywhere , everyone screaming at each other , walking 1 mph if not slower , pallets blocking all the isles in the middle of the day . <sssss> pass ! 
1		new ownership does n't get it . 
1		decided to check the place out last night as it 's in my neighborhood ... to say the service was poor would be admitting there was service ... walked in was told there was a show and to choose either a place at the bar or the tables at the end or on the patio , choose the inside . <sssss> sat down . <sssss> 10 minutes later waitress hands me a menu ... 20 minutes later i walk out with out anyone asking me for a drink or what i wanted to eat . <sssss> had heard good things about the place . <sssss> in my opinion avoid like the plague . 
1		this property management team paid a contractor before the job was finished and here is the message i sent to the management team ... please save your sanity and do n't use these guys to manage your property ... but you were supposed to look at the whole tile job , for instance the two colors of tiles installed in the living room , the toilets that were not replaced into the bathrooms , the closet doors that were not put back correctly they swing instead of slide -lrb- missing the door tracks -rrb- . <sssss> the mess he left in the house , did n't clean up after all his work , and the pile of trash from the tile job left on the front yard and driveway . <sssss> i instructed you to only pay him when the job was complete . <sssss> the job obviously still is n't complete 3 months after the job was done . <sssss> why would you ever pay a contractor when he did n't complete the job ???? <sssss> i 'm paying you and your company to look after my property , would you do this if this was your property ???? <sssss> i do n't think so !!! <sssss> you 're taking advantage of a client that does n't live in the neighborhood and ca n't get to the property and live in a different state !!! <sssss> what am i paying you for ... to manage my property . <sssss> i 'm very disappointed . <sssss> below are the pictures you sent me when the job was `` complete '' on june 4 2013 ... these pictures look good the other pictures of the property are from a friend of mine that went to take some pictures of my property , she said the place looked so dirty and the tiles were two different colors , the oven was never reconnected , the toilets were not put back , but in the garage and when she went to open the closets , door tracks were never put back on . <sssss> plus the ac was on full blast . <sssss> not only could she not get into the property because it was n't your lock box on my house but someone else 's lock box . <sssss> so now i know why my house has n't been rented in 4 months . <sssss> no one can get into the property because the lock box and it looks like crap !! <sssss> that is 4 months of mortgage payments down the drain . <sssss> thank you for waisting my money . 
1		errrr , the grounds look nice , up to the gate at least ... i was turned away at the gate because i did not know anybody staying at the hotel . <sssss> i said well my family is coming to town and i wanted to check out the resort , the bulldog at the gate at the gate insisted that if i did not know anybody staying at the resort i could not come in . <sssss> then he asked for my families name , i a fit of confusion i said ` huh , what , why , ummm i guess i 'll turn around ' ` yeah turn around please ... and as i was pulling away the gate keeper said something that i did n't catch that sounded pretty snooty . <sssss> seems a little ass-backwards to me treating potential guests in such a way . 
1		ripoff alert ! <sssss> went through the drive-through , and ordered the thursday taco special for $ 2.09 . <sssss> paid with a five , received 56 cents back , and no receipt . <sssss> hmmmm . <sssss> not only a ripoff , but the food sucks too ! 
1		if you 're going to open a brewpub you need three absolutes . <sssss> good beer , fish and chips , and a decent handmade pub burger . <sssss> this place has nasty beer , no fish , and horrible hamburgers !! <sssss> nice place with shiny beer equipment , however , this place just sucks !! <sssss> service was great , management was clueless . <sssss> if you order a hop dog ipa , it damn sure better have some hops in it !! <sssss> make your own hamburger patties !! <sssss> preformed frozen patties are an embarrassment to your location . <sssss> either get it right or get out of the way and make room for somebody who can do it better . <sssss> all in all , skip it and go get a slice at vimcents !! 
1		we had to bus our own table . <sssss> after asking for someone to take our order like 10 times , they did only to tell us -lrb- after we asked where our drinks were 45 min later -rrb- our order was n't entered because they are too busy . <sssss> `` sorry , there is nothing i can do . '' <sssss> we left with nothing after sitting here for an hour and a half . <sssss> worst service and business management ever . 
1		lots of stuff isnt really organic as stated so just make sure you read ingredients carefully 
1		i 've always loved domino 's and this one is no exception until last night . <sssss> i went to order a pizza and knew that they had stopped delivering to my area so asked if i could do carry-out . <sssss> carry-out closes right before i called so i asked i 'd i could have a delivery to their parking lot -lrb- semi joking -rrb- and they said no . <sssss> then when i said `` so , there is no way i can buy a pizza from you guys ? '' <sssss> he responded with `` no . <sssss> you should try barro 's or papa john 's '' ... i understand the place being closed and all but his rude , short attitude along with the fact that he did n't even recommend another local domino 's and instead referred me to another company for pizza was absurd . <sssss> if i was the manager , i 'd fire that kid on the spot . 
1		wow . <sssss> . <sssss> where to begin ... i guess it 's really my fault for thinking a chain could do shrimp and grits but the photo looked so good ... sucker . <sssss> when the food finally arrived it was in a cast iron pan and was luke warm . <sssss> . <sssss> the biscuit was a hockey puck , the shrimp was super gritty ... gross.the grits had a weird texture , more like over processed polenta . <sssss> i thought i could just eat the grits on the second round , they were hot but terrible , i tried hot sauce ... that did n't work , it was suppose to have sausage which was exactly 2 small pieces that i had to look for and tasted like processed hot dog . <sssss> so i paid for the service , left hungry and went somewhere else ... how sad never again joe . 
1		i think one person said it already , but this place needs a serious , i mean serious health inspection . <sssss> my girlfriend and i love korean food and we always try to find the best ones in every city we are at . <sssss> so we looked at this place and it got good reviews . <sssss> so you know , thinking this will be a good spot we decided to go . <sssss> big mistake ever , as soon as we walked in , the odor was just off . <sssss> we 're asian and i know asian food can smell a little off , but this odor was different . <sssss> the odor was a combination of the trash water you find at the bottom of the trash can and spoiled food . <sssss> still , we continued to sit down and ignored the odor but the place had so many flies that they were landing on my food . <sssss> that ticked us off so just asked for the check and did n't even finish our food 
1		the service is horrible , i asked if i could change my order before she even entered it into the computer , and she told me no . <sssss> when i got the sandwich it was dry and bland , the bun was hard and dry but the worst was the fries , a couple of them were still frozen and a couple were rapped in hair . <sssss> gross . <sssss> not a place i will go back too . 
1		a total nightmare of an experience with this lot . <sssss> i fly into phoenix once a year to visit my parents located in goodyear , az. . <sssss> in order to save my wife and i a few dollars , i decided to avoid rentign from the airport wnterprise location , and try the local goodyear location . <sssss> what a mistake !!!! <sssss> as my wife always tells me , you get what you paid for ... how true . <sssss> i was offered the choice , as an upgrade mind you , of the smallest , cars imanigable ... i select a kia at first , drove it a mile , and promptly returned it . <sssss> . <sssss> the seats felt like coffin lids ... the car wrote erradicaly . <sssss> . <sssss> next , was my second choice , a chevy cobalt ... the drivers seat sank to the left ... the brake pads were obviously in poor condition , as in order to stop , additional pressure was required on the brakes ... but the worst was yet to come . <sssss> . <sssss> the same night after renting the checy cobalt , i went o gas up the tank , as the car renta agency only left the car with less than a quarter of a tan of gas !!! <sssss> unhreard of ... as i went to shut the car off , it would not allow me to ... the key was stuck in the on position !!! <sssss> long story short , i get th car back on empty to my parents , and ask my step father , who 's aformer car mechanic to get the key out and the car off . <sssss> . <sssss> he could not do it . <sssss> . <sssss> he had to disable the car , by pulling a few enginen cables loose , which left the headlights still on !!!! <sssss> in the interim i was o nthe phone with enterprise 's `` emergency '' road side assistance . <sssss> . <sssss> i spoje to two different operators . <sssss> . <sssss> opne had the nerve to laugh hystericaly in my ear at my situation , telling me that they have trouble similar to mine wit hthe chevy cobalt 's that they rebnt . <sssss> . <sssss> sothat is funny to charge the public for cars you know are unsafe ? <sssss> i think not jackass . <sssss> the the emergency operator after finishing his chuckle routine ... told me that they will onoly send trippl e a out to tow their car , once the enginen has stoped ... in the meantime we were stil trying to get the enginen off . <sssss> . <sssss> before my step father figured out how to ... i asked the phone operator , am i supposed to drive around untilthe car runs out of gas i nthe desert at 11 pm ???? <sssss> or leave it here i n my parent 's dtiveway , t hy reside in an upscale gated golf community ... the noise was disturing their neighbors , from the car running , and the exhaust fumes smelled like exhaust fumes . <sssss> . <sssss> awful . <sssss> an hour later the tow truck guy heads out , he 's lost , as he 's from chandler , located a distance away ... he gets there . <sssss> . <sssss> and says oh no ... curing under his breath ... they toldme at entrprise that the car was in the street ... i had just had it then ... the tow guy and i physicaly pushed the car into the street . <sssss> . <sssss> after midnight now this car was out of my life ... i thought !!! <sssss> the next day the goodyear enterprise sent out a rep. with a really nice , new mazda ... but it did not have an aux ipod jack ... ok , no biggie . <sssss> . <sssss> this car was sweet ... ran well , looked good , etc. ... i was assurd my oneday rntal was free , the remaning four days reduced to half price ... great !!! <sssss> i return the car four days later , . <sssss> on time , in mint condition , with a full tank of gas . <sssss> . <sssss> they gave it to me initaly with 1/3 tank filled ... the car was fine , but the price discount they quoted me was incorrect . <sssss> . <sssss> they lied straight to my face at the rental location in goodyear-claiming they nevrt guarnteed me 4 days at half price , onlyone !!! <sssss> so after ome debate it was reduced afew dollars , that was it . <sssss> . <sssss> i just wanted to get home , and on my flight a few hours later ... once back at home i wrote to the enterprise corp. . <sssss> a rep. from the main branch in phoenix phoned me ... he was on the ball this guy , agreed with all of my complants ... gave me the full agreed upon 1/2 price with ad ay free rental . <sssss> . <sssss> car cost me under 70.00 for 5 days . <sssss> . <sssss> but man , the hassels involved left a sour taste in my mouth ... i would not recomend the goodyear location ... they are incompetant at best , and non trustworthy . <sssss> i 've had better luck with other enterprises around the country . <sssss> thy are not all as corrupt as this one ... it was alearning experience to say the least . <sssss> ps . <sssss> as i was checkignout of the goodyear enterprise location , a fellow customer was complaning that his rental car from them , t he same location had bad brakes , he believed the car was once in an accident !!! <sssss> i shook his hand . 
2		not worth $ 220 but the course is in wonderful shape . <sssss> the greens are amazing here . <sssss> the ball actually rolls where it should go . <sssss> +1 star ! 
2		i worked out at this gym for a little under a year between april 2012 to march 2013 . <sssss> i had recently moved to phoenix from the chicago-area and had been a member at my local y in illinois for 5 + years . <sssss> i 'm not sure if my illinois-based ymca is just super nice and i had become spoiled , or what the deal is , but i found this y disappointing . <sssss> i went in for a tour and membership info when i first arrived in phoenix . <sssss> the membership fee was around $ 50/month , which i found outrageous for the shape this place is in . <sssss> it 's older -lrb- though apparently recently renovated ? -rrb- <sssss> , small exercise rooms , and a maze of floors/hallways/stairs . <sssss> i knew after touring the place i could n't justify the price . <sssss> i later found out that the ys in the valley participate in the fitness program through my medical insurance , which is $ 25/month -- that is the only reason i decided to join . <sssss> i signed up for my insurance fitness program , and presented the information to the y. that , in and of itself , was a nightmare . <sssss> i wo n't go into that in this review , though , since i joined at the christown ymca , and it would n't be fair to blame the downtown location for their issues . <sssss> back to my review of the downtown location . <sssss> when i first started coming regularly , their water machine was broken . <sssss> two weeks later , it was still out of order , and i have no idea how long it was not functioning before i joined . <sssss> i generally take group exercise classes at the gym , and this location offers a decent variety . <sssss> which brings me to my next issue -- the instructors . <sssss> the ones i 've had are generally ok , though i do n't think the kickboxing class is nearly the great workout that everyone seems to think . <sssss> however , i will say that on one memorable occasion when i arrived to take a spin class , i asked the instructor -lrb- politely -rrb- if we could please turn on the fans in the cycle room since it is tiny , has no air flow , and gets hot as hades . <sssss> he replied , `` i do n't use fans in my class . '' <sssss> wow . <sssss> i have never experienced such rudeness/arrogance from a class instructor anywhere previously or since . <sssss> i really love supporting ymcas and helping the community , but i do n't think i could justify the cost of this one in exchange for the facilities & service . 
2		damnit , damnit , damnit ! <sssss> i wanted to write a good review of this little mom and pop restaurant . <sssss> on the surface it 's got a lot going for it ; it 's quaint and sufficiently run down enough to make you think it 's one of those small gems , it 's gotten great reviews in the past , it smells like a good mexican food place should , and it 's been around forever . <sssss> unfortunately it did not live up to expectations . <sssss> i got a bean burrito with sour cream and a large horchata . <sssss> the tortilla was excellent , but the beans were so cold that they did n't melt -lrb- or ever warm -rrb- the clump if cold cheese inside , leaving me with what is essentially a burrito-cicle . <sssss> i came in relatively early at 11:10 so i suspect that they just were not really ready for me . <sssss> the taste was n't bad , it was just that it was too cold to really enjoy . <sssss> as a sidenote , the horchata was so sweet that it was almost undrinkable , and had the taste and consistency of coffee creamer . <sssss> what a shame . 
2		oh man . <sssss> i feel kinda bad giving this place two stars with all the glowing reviews below me . <sssss> but come on ! <sssss> the place is soooo shady . <sssss> they charged my boyfriend $ 3 for a glass of coke poured from a can -- and not even the whole can ! <sssss> and in the same night , i got charged $ 4 , $ 5 and $ 6 the same drink from different bartenders . <sssss> any of those prices are a lot of money for a gin and tonic , with well gin ! <sssss> after paying cover , you end up pretty much broke at the end of the night . <sssss> on top of the money situation , this place just screams pretension ! <sssss> they do n't have any theme -- they are just trying way too hard to be cool . <sssss> i mean , there is actually a crooked painting on the wall . <sssss> a crooked bad painting on the wall . <sssss> i would have given only one star , but the martinis are pretty damn good . <sssss> plus , the music is always fun . <sssss> but , still , i wo n't be going back anytime soon . 
2		i heard so many good things about this place ... . <sssss> but i was just not impressed . <sssss> on a friday night , it 's a long wait ... i 'm talking an hour . <sssss> the food was just ok . <sssss> it was not special . <sssss> there were four of us and we shared a little of everything . <sssss> 3 out of 4 agreed that it was below average . <sssss> maybe we ordered the wrong thing ... but i did not like it . 
2		tried the brisket , no smoke flavor and no smoke ring . <sssss> same goes for the pork ribs , no smoke flavor . <sssss> the sauces are good , i reallt liked the spicey sauce . <sssss> side are ok but nothing special . <sssss> i will go back and try other items . <sssss> i 've worked in bbq and the items i tried would embarass texes . 
2		okay , so after reading a super hilarious recent spiel about the personal trainer and the yelp menace in cali , i reread my review and decided that even if i do n't want to patronize this establishment anymore , i want my review to be fair -lrb- and i do n't want to be listed as a menace , now , do i -rrb- . <sssss> so since i rated the service a 1 and the food a 3.5 , i think a 2 is a more appropriate overall score than my original 1 . <sssss> i forced myself to eat lunch there one more time to confirm that the food is tasty enough to warrant this adjustment , and it is . <sssss> i went around 2:00 pm-ish to avoid trouble , and no , i did not bring sam the watch . 
2		great atmosphere and location , but mediocre food . <sssss> the tapas were sub-par and the paella valenciana did n't deserve to be called paella . <sssss> the best part of the meal by far was the warm bread rolls served with an aioli dip . <sssss> our friendly waiter knew absolutely nothing about spanish food , but was very nice . <sssss> i 'd blame management for his ingnorance . <sssss> the wine list was extensive and reasonable , and dessert was acceptable . <sssss> they had an excellent guitarrist playing classic flamenco on the patio , so i 'd recommend this place for a glass of wine and live music on a nice day or night , but do n't go hungry or you 'll be dissapointed . 
2		i was really looking forward to finally trying out the new sheraton 's new bar . <sssss> man , was i disappointed ! <sssss> one - it 's just a hotel bar , and it * felt * like a hotel bar . <sssss> i 'm glad i only came for happy hour and not a nice meal because i totally felt like i was just in a hotel . <sssss> beer - ok selection -lrb- random new belgium beers i 'd never heard of , a four peaks beer i 'd never heard of - how is that possible ? <sssss> - a nut brown ale , a lagunitas , a couple hefeiwizens ... all in all it was about 10 beers on hh special -rrb- that were only $ 3 on hh -lrb- $ 3.75 -rrb- otherwise . <sssss> that 's pretty price . <sssss> no wines by the glass under $ 10 or on hh special - bummer . <sssss> good sounding food selection on hh - notice i say it sounds good , but it was not good , not at all ! <sssss> we got the sliders -lrb- $ 9 -rrb- and sweet potato tots -lrb- $ 4 -rrb- . <sssss> sliders -lrb- 2 -rrb- were dry-meat , bland little things that came with fried onions and some kind of horseradish sauce that was just terrible . <sssss> sweet pot tots came out * burned * -lrb- really ? -rrb- <sssss> and not finely chopped and mashed back together in tot shaped and fried , like regular tots , but simply cut into tot shape and then fried -lrb- or , in this case , burned -rrb- . <sssss> which means when you bite into it , it tastes like a grease ball . <sssss> they came with ranch -lrb- again , really ? -rrb- <sssss> for dipping , and -lrb- now i just sound nit-picky , but this place is supposed to be nice , right ? -rrb- <sssss> it was the watery , runny kind of ranch that reminded me of the kind you got in middle school . <sssss> my friend got the chicken wrap that actually looked pretty good and she seemed to enjoy it , and a side of fries , which came with ketchup and ... well i do n't know the other dip was supposed to be . <sssss> it was orange , so i hoped it was a chipotle mayo or fancy mustard that would help my tots . <sssss> but no , it was thick - but congealed like it had been untouched and left out for awhile , and tasted terrible . <sssss> i really ca n't place what it was supposed to be or taste like - the seasoning that came on the fries did n't help either . <sssss> how can you mess up fries ?!?! <sssss> -lrb- ok , to solve the mysery , i just looked up the menu and it says `` creamy garlic '' was the indiscernible fry dip . <sssss> um , what ?? -rrb- <sssss> ok , enough bad stuff , here 's what i did like . <sssss> root beer -lrb- virgil 's -rrb- on tap . <sssss> that 's pretty cool . <sssss> and , my all time favorite part - the prints from mexican artist theresa villegas they had up -lrb- though sort of out of sight by the bathrooms -rrb- . <sssss> she does these amazing prints inspired by the traditional la loteria card game -lrb- her prints are of the same name -rrb- . <sssss> i originally heard of her when she showed at the mesa arts center two years ago and have never talked to anyone who knew about her , let alone seen them anywhere ! <sssss> i thought that was amazing . <sssss> also , when the bartender overheard us talking about having ridden the light rail , she informed us that by showing our ticket we got 25 percent off our entire bill ! <sssss> wow , that 's a great deal -lrb- i think that only runs through the end of this month , though -rrb- . 
2		mimi 's cafe is one of those mid-priced restaurants , that could be considered a `` nice night out ... '' or exciting `` brunch experience '' -- but they 're lacking , and i ca n't quite put my finger on where . <sssss> i love their muffins . <sssss> whatever bakery they ship those bad boys from , i wish i could buy whole sale . <sssss> they are spectacular . <sssss> that being said , the rest of their menu comes with fancy french names , fancy french prices , and american diner quality . <sssss> my grandmother is a big fan of this place , so i do spend a lot of nights here with her . <sssss> it seems to be a happening place for the 65 + crowd . <sssss> even as late as 7pm ! <sssss> every once in a while they celebrate by lowering certain menu prices to their price in the 70s which is great -lrb- 59 cent muffins ! <sssss> i bought a dozen ! -rrb- <sssss> i 'm by no means a food snob , but please mimis ... if you 're going to charge 12 dollars for a omelet , i should n't be tasting imitation cheddar . 
2		in a nutshell , overpriced , poor quality mexican food . <sssss> nothing at all memorable about this place . <sssss> the refried beans were bland and the rice overcooked and mushy . <sssss> everything is was smothered in cheese , which can be a good thing , but not with flour -lrb- flour ! -rrb- <sssss> tortillas . <sssss> not recommended . 
2		i went to my monthly philosophical gathering last friday ... we examine , ponder and discuss some of the more esoteric aspects of life ! <sssss> i had so much fun ! <sssss> it 's 2-3 hours of defining , questioning , cussing , discussing , opining , agreeing , disagreeing ... well , you get the drift ... last week 's topic was `` what is art ? '' <sssss> i did not know that people felt as passionately about art and artistic expression as they do ... and that includes me :-rrb- normally , i would try to have a couple of pops before a discussion like this -lrb- that 's to honor socrates , aristotle , plato and their students ... their sessions were often drunken debauches and the last man standing was the `` winner '' in the philosophical debate of the evening ... good times :-rrb- but i did n't ... i was stone cold sober for this discussion ... i might have even made sense ! <sssss> after we finished our discussion , several of us decided that a cocktail was a very good idea and headed to the vig ... i know , you thought it was hip nightspot , but it 's really renowned throughout the valley of the sun as a philosopher 's hangout . <sssss> nice place ... all concretey from the outside , all wood and fabric and leathery inside ... pretty ... even `` artistic '' :-rrb- when we got to the vig , the scholarly discussions were occurring at full volume all around us :-rrb- * `` gim me a cig '' * `` dude !!!! '' <sssss> * `` do n't look ... it 's cindy and darrel '' * `` hey baby ... wan na go see my -lrb- car , house , dog , condo , wiener , etc. -rrb- '' and much , much more ... accompanied by enormous clouds of cigarette smoke -lrb- another aid to a good philosophical discussion -rrb- . <sssss> we sat and chatted and had a couple of pops ... and i would have said that the vig was a-ok ... except for one minor philosophical disagreement ... you , mr. waitperson , do n't get to unilaterally upgrade my order to something far more expensive ! <sssss> i had no idea who was going to be buying -lrb- although it turned out to be me -rrb- and i ordered j&b with a cube and a splash -lrb- i did n't want to put the hurt on my philosophically minded buddies by ordering the expensive stuff :-rrb- ... but when the waiter brought my drink , i knew instantly that this was n't j&b ... it was macallan 12 ! <sssss> and while i do love it so , it was almost 3 times as expensive as the j&b ... i asked the waiter why he did n't bring what i ordered and he said ... and i quote ... `` quote '' ... `` the bartender is a scotch guy and said this is better '' ... end quote . <sssss> no sh * t ! <sssss> i quietly said `` i did n't order the macallan ... are you saying this is going to be the same price as the j&b ? <sssss> oh no ... it was n't :-lrb- but as my waitperson said ... `` it 's already poured ... what do you want me to do about it ? '' <sssss> i could have made a scene , caused a problem , left a $ 0.10 tip ... but i did n't ... this was philosophy night ... i was in a philosophical mood ! <sssss> and my philosophy is this ... i have a giant problem with any establishment that pulls this kind of crap ... it may only be an isolated incident , but it could also be systemic ... how many drunks check their tabs ? <sssss> i know , you 're saying `` well , donald , it 's only the difference between $ 5.50 and $ 14.00 for that drink '' , and you would be right ... i spill more than that most days :-rrb- but i get to decide what i spill it on ... not the bartender and waitperson at the vig . <sssss> at best it 's corrupt and at worst , it 's , well ... worse than corrupt . 
2		really bland food . <sssss> that 's the summary for this place . <sssss> i should have known when they made a point of saying every menu item was 475 calories . <sssss> the food was n't bad but it was tasteless and pricy . <sssss> this is not a two $ restaurant . <sssss> much more like a $ $ $ . <sssss> not recommended . 
2		rooms are small , but then again ... it 's a casino hotel . <sssss> they want you to be uncomfortable in the room so you 'll be more likely to gamble downstairs . <sssss> also , the walls are exceptionally thin . <sssss> there was a pervasive odor of stale cigarettes throughout the hotel . <sssss> either the air scrubbers were n't doing their job or something was off . <sssss> i was there a week and it was not until the last night that i figured out that it was the plastic mattress pads on the beds that made me so irrationally hot every night , waking up in a pool of sweat . <sssss> really ? <sssss> plastic mattress pads in a supposedly 4 star hotel ?? <sssss> the good ? <sssss> thomas , the concierge . <sssss> first rate guy with wonderful recommendations . <sssss> would i stay there again ? <sssss> probably not . <sssss> would i stop by to see what thomas has for great places to visit and dine ? <sssss> oh yes ! 
2		been sitting for 45 min and still no sight of the expensive food ! 
2		no wonder blockbuster is going out of business . <sssss> they arent very observant when i was needing help . <sssss> they were very rude and didnt care to tell me all of the information i was looking for from them . <sssss> its very dirty and not well organized . 
2		if my current issues are resolved , i will revisit this review and edit . <sssss> however , my current situation is this : in the past 24 hours , i have had 2 visits , taking nearly 4 hours ! <sssss> when making the appt , i received no information that a `` contact lens exam/fitting '' would necessitate 2 visits . <sssss> during the exam , when i hesitated having my eyes dilated , i explained to the student that i spend a lot of my work hours in the car and still had to work that afternoon . <sssss> she explained that it would only affect `` some blurriness when reading up close . '' <sssss> wrong !! <sssss> the minute i stepped into the sun , i was rendered incapacitated and could barely keep my eyes open a bit to drive home . <sssss> this necessitated my having to take 2.5 hours of pa time from my job - in addition to the 1.5 hours my exam took . <sssss> i was told that the next day i would see someone specializing in contact fittings . <sssss> wrong ! <sssss> the student i saw the next day was extremely nice , but had no clue what he was doing regarding the proper product , prescription , and fit . <sssss> i spent 2 more hours with this student on trial-and - error contacts . <sssss> the doctor looked in on us twice for less than a 5 minute total . <sssss> again , she was very nice but nothing was being accomplished . <sssss> they sent me on my way with a trial pair of lenses that i had to remove and throw away 3 hours later because i could not drive in them ... . <sssss> everything was blurry and driving was not safe ! <sssss> did i mention i told them that i drive a lot in my job ???? <sssss> i have worn lenses before , and all my friends my age wear lenses , so i am assuming this is possible with the proper expertise ... but that is the one thing i am not getting . <sssss> i have been `` invited '' to go back tomorrow and have no idea if i will do that . <sssss> neither will i pay for a service i did not receive . <sssss> update , 6/21/12 : i returned to my previous optician , which i previously thought to be over-priced . <sssss> they fitted me perfectly with a different prescription in each eye , and i have been wearing contacts daily since . <sssss> in the future , i would only use midwestern for frames , as they have a good selection . 
2		i 'm sorry , but those of you who have given serrano 's a good review never had really great authentic mexican food . <sssss> i 've tried this place a couple times , only because it is close to my house . <sssss> each time i am hopeful it will get better . <sssss> each time it disappoints more than the previous . <sssss> save your money . 
2		over the last 5 years or so , i 've eaten lunch at dilly 's deli a couple dozen times . <sssss> the location is excellent , as it is near my office , and the interior décor is clean , modest , and charming . <sssss> the music seems to vary , but on today 's trip , it appeared to be a mix of oldies and jazzy easy listening . <sssss> while i 've never had to wait for a table to clear , seating can be limited during lunch hours . <sssss> the service is friendly and quick and the menu offerings plentiful and interesting . <sssss> vegetarians will find a handful of options here , though it is likely you can request to omit meat from any sandwich or salad . <sssss> carrying boar 's head ingredients is a plus , however the way their sandwiches are assembled and the ratio of ingredients used simply does n't work for me . <sssss> oftentimes , i find my sandwich has a bulge of deli meat in the center and much less -lrb- and sometimes none at all -rrb- toward the outer parts nearing the crust . <sssss> it has been my experience that the wraps are not treated this way , though the only wrap i 've tried -lrb- mexi -rrb- lacked flavor and tasted processed . <sssss> i 've eaten one salad at dilly 's - the greek - and , while it is tasty , i discovered a dead fly in it halfway through and have n't ordered a salad there since . <sssss> as other reviewers have reported , the soups are n't as piping hot as i 'd like , though the variety and additional `` daily soup '' is appreciated . <sssss> the bread is deliciously soft , warm , flavorful , and large - ideal for accompanying a soup or salad . <sssss> if you 're accustomed to filling up on a sandwich made with normal-sized slices , i suggest ordering a half sandwich so you can sample a side of soup , salad , or dessert as well . <sssss> all sandwiches are served with a pickle spear . <sssss> the cookies and brownies get 4 stars on their own . <sssss> today i gave dilly 's another shot and ordered a new menu item , the red bird , on wheat . <sssss> personally , i 'm not a fan . <sssss> the blazin ' buffalo , dilly bird , and smokey mountain boast far better flavor combinations , imo . <sssss> also , my pickle spear had a hair on it . <sssss> dilly 's is a bit pricier than its nearby competition -lrb- all whole sandwiches are $ 6.99 -rrb- , though a reasonable price if shared . <sssss> overall , this is a higher quality sandwich shop than subway , blimpie , and the like . <sssss> unfortunately , the fly and hair experiences combined with the bread/meat ratio issue guarantee i will not return . 
2		i love the food here , but the planning and service are atrocious . <sssss> first off , reservations do n't mean what you think they do . <sssss> make a reservation ? <sssss> plan to still wait and then get seated at a community table . <sssss> secondly , they have too much going on . <sssss> most of the year appears to feature a limited menu of one kind or another . <sssss> if you go there and it 's an open menu day , try not to like the food too much , because it may be a year before you can have it again . <sssss> finally , i 've had more crappy service there than i 've had good . <sssss> servers have forgotten to bring a course , brought the wrong food , not checked back on us - you name it . <sssss> it 's sad because the food here really is good . <sssss> it 's just so hard to get . 
2		wow i ca n't believe how many people think this place is awesome ! <sssss> i love vienna hot dogs but that is the only reason this place gets 2 stars is cause they use vienna beef . <sssss> the hot dog is never really hot , it seems like it 's always sitting in warm water waiting to be ordered . <sssss> the fries are n't fresh so that gives them no points . <sssss> they use the crinkle fries . <sssss> i have n't had anything else there so i can only give you my opinion on the hot dogs . <sssss> the only thing this has over luke 's is that it 's cheaper . 
2		this place is small with an large patio area . <sssss> they have some ok teriyaki white chicken -lrb- needs more sauce kind of dry -rrb- and terribly flavorless chicken fried rice . <sssss> the service was quick and nice but i would n't recommend dining there as it seems to be heavy traffic for drunks and homeless people -lrb- unless people watching of sadness is your thing -rrb- so you would be best to pick up instead . <sssss> i doubt i go back since the place is only so so at best for two of my favorite things . <sssss> the crab puffs were nice though . 
2		i was so disappointed by my lunch at sacks today . <sssss> it reminded me of a place in albuquerque called baggins ... but they fell way short on customer service and quality . <sssss> while the patio was pretty full , there was no line and i was able to walk right up to the counter to order . <sssss> no greeting . <sssss> she took my order , no explanation . <sssss> although , i prompted by saying , `` this is my first time here . '' <sssss> counterworker just stared blankly until i asked , `` so do i wait here or do you call my name ? '' <sssss> the sandwich was fine : egg salad , cream cheese and bacon on multigrain bread . <sssss> not the best i 've ever had . <sssss> i ate half then turned to the bite sized cookie as my reward . <sssss> it was hard as a rock ! <sssss> i did n't even finish the shard that i bit off . <sssss> i do n't see any real reason to go back . 
2		i 've been here a couple of times now . <sssss> i know this is a chain hair cutting joint but thought i 'd review it anyways . <sssss> fantastic sams opened in this location a few months ago . <sssss> this store is located where the old shipping and mail store was . <sssss> the inside is new and clean in appearance . <sssss> while the employees have been pleasant and nice , the results of each visit are a mixed bag . <sssss> on our last visit the hair cutter gal really did a number on my kids hair and it was n't a good number . <sssss> i did n't realize right away as my kid was bouncy and happy and the hair was still wet and kind of combed or parted or something . <sssss> but the next day i knew i 'd subjected my kid to a bad haircut and was kinda ticked that i left a tip . <sssss> the last person that cut my hair was friendly but kept nitpicking what should have been an extremely simple haircut of a buzz all the way around . <sssss> it was kind of awkward really . <sssss> my significant other had her eyebrows slightly butchered here on one occasion but left happily with a great haircut on a different occasion . <sssss> i think i prefer a regular barber for myself and supercuts for a chain-type place . <sssss> i guess it does n't really matter as it 's all in who 's cutting the hair and i think stylists tend to come and go from joints like this so good and bad can be gone the next day forever and i 'd never really know . <sssss> i suppose a bonus is that it is located right next to a nail salon so the ladies might enjoy doing something to their hair and then going next door to get a foot massage or pedicure or something . 
2		shocked ! <sssss> i ca n't believe the number of people that voted so high on this sea food restaurant . <sssss> the sea food is fresh , but i 'm not impressed by the presentation or culinary creativity of the restaurant . <sssss> i thought i would never go here again , but after reading the yelp votes i will make a point to visit the fish market restaurant again . 
2		barcelona was a great restaurant years ago and had the best paella in scottsdale . <sssss> today , barcelona is supposed to be a club scene , but in actuality , it 's fairly empty . <sssss> this place lost its focus and reminds me of maestro 's in the oc . 
2		so we had come here initially to meet up with some friends who had left us a lot earlier than i was hoping . <sssss> we had gotten to stadium club around 8:35 and was n't approached by any staff member until 9:06 pm . <sssss> 1st negative of the night because i was hopeful to see how good their food/service was since this place is right down the street from us . <sssss> :-lrb- we placed our orders for food and drink at the same time since we had the time to look at the menu . <sssss> i was debating between the corona battered fish and chips or the big easy `` cajun '' spiced chicken sandwich . <sssss> the waitress said the big easy was popular which i find kind of hard to believe now . <sssss> but anyways i had ordered a arnold palmer which is just iced tea and lemonade another thing i wish i never ordered . <sssss> you are probably wondering why ? <sssss> why ? <sssss> why ? <sssss> am i right ? <sssss> first off the arnold palmer did not get to the table until after i received my food -lrb- because the tea was brewing apparently -rrb- when i was dying of thirst and extreme hunger . <sssss> my boyfriend got his large glass of blue moon pretty fast . <sssss> :-lrb- so as i was dehydrating thinking how slow it was going to get the stuff i ordered and out comes our food in like 30 minutes when all we ordered was a chicken sandwich and a burger . <sssss> as my side i ordered cole slaw which i yet again also regret . <sssss> it lacked in flavor , and so did my chicken sandwich . <sssss> it was seasoned with something but i tasted no kick or spice what so ever . <sssss> fail !!! <sssss> i wish i ordered the curly fries -lrb- which was my initial first pick -rrb- my boyfriend got them so i picked at them every once in awhile as usual . <sssss> the arnold palmer didnt even taste amazing . <sssss> everything i ordered was a epic fail . <sssss> thankfully when we got our check the lady was fast with that . <sssss> so ... i do n't think i will be back by choice any time soon . <sssss> unless i have to drive my boyfriend there to meet up with people all i would get next time are a side of their curly fries if i am hungry . 
2		i have been taking friends and relatives here for several years but no more . <sssss> sat night 's visit went wrong in so many ways . <sssss> we agreed to wait 30 min for a patio table and told we could order drinks at a table indoors while we waited . <sssss> our waitress was not informed of that . <sssss> we ordered beers they had listed but the first tap beer we ordered they were out . <sssss> the bottled beer we ordered they were out , all of which led to delayed service . <sssss> we had to nag to be seated outside even though we could see tables opening up and were told twice they were `` setting up '' for us which involved all of setting out rolled up napkins . <sssss> then we finally were seated but they put three of us at two small tables set next to each other which was so clumsy . <sssss> a server tried to bring our water out to us even though one was empty and asked which of us was by the door so he could give us the right glass . <sssss> i had to tell him to bring fresh waters . <sssss> finally we ordered dinner and a bottle of cline zinfandel -- very common label . <sssss> nope , they were out . <sssss> the bottle we took instead was great however and our food was very good and well-served . <sssss> we did get an offer to move to a square table before our food arrived but we declined because it was next to a table at which three young women were all smoking !! <sssss> i suspected they were friends of a manager who came to visit them for a while . <sssss> he should have been trying to manage the service instead . <sssss> our server was very nice and apologetic , and we tipped her accordingly , but she could not make up for the total lack of management in the restaurant that night . <sssss> when we left , our water glasses all were empty and had been for some time . <sssss> very disappointing all around ! 
2		i 'd been wanting to check this place for quite some time and i finally got the chance last night -lrb- sunday 9/8 -rrb- as i was there to see an old friend off who is moving away . <sssss> -lrb- it 's 8 p.m. and fairly packed . <sssss> the douche quotient is also a bit higher than i expected . -rrb- <sssss> i was a little underwhelmed with the tap selection , especially when tops is known for their stellar array of wonderful and varied beers , but i was nonetheless able to find something i 'd been dying to try - the lips of faith coconut curry . <sssss> a customer was sitting at the bar directly in front of me and overheard me mentioning to my friend that that 's what i was going to order . <sssss> he suggested sampling it first . <sssss> while the request for a sample was met with some ` tood from the bartender , it was the right call - not something i 'd want a whole pint of . <sssss> for this sample , i was punished and forced to wait 12 minutes before the bartender decided he had absolutely nothing else with which to fake being busy and he was practically forced to approach me again . <sssss> this time , i ordered a prescott heroes 19 - sample not required . <sssss> i love brown ales and this was decent enough , but also nothing special . <sssss> at precisely 8:30 , the lights dimmed , the volume on the tvs went up , and everyone except my two friends and i had shut the fuck up . <sssss> i turn around to notice everyone staring up at a tv . <sssss> breaking bad . <sssss> `` oh , '' my friend turns to me and says , `` it 's one of those kind of bars . '' <sssss> because i did n't know conversation during breaking bad was strictly verboten , we continued speaking , albeit in a most subdued tone . <sssss> dude sitting next to the sample-suggesting gentleman and looking like he 'd be more comfortable reading comic books at home in his mommy 's basement actually turned around and shushed us ! <sssss> he fucking shushed us !! <sssss> are you kidding me ???? <sssss> that was it ... time to slug our beers and go elsewhere . 
2		just had a drink but did not really want to stay much longer . <sssss> the martini was watery and the menu was not up to my expectations . <sssss> still , it 's a cool place to hang out before seeing a movie . 
2		breakfast burrito left me feeling naseous all day . <sssss> very greasy yet dry meat . <sssss> . <sssss> weird combo . <sssss> people are nice and it is clean so i guess that 's good ? 
2		these guys need to step it up alot . <sssss> they 've got the perfect location , and we were really excited to find it . <sssss> but what the heck , the salad bar was just average , the meat was ok . <sssss> this could have been an ever so wonderful experience , but instead , just so so . <sssss> we would go back again , if we found a real salad bar , and some more variety to the menu . <sssss> what 's wrong with something fried , like zucchini , shrimp ... . 
2		i had high hopes as a coloradan in arizona after i read all the other reviews on yelp . <sssss> my husband and i ordered the tamale , taco combo plate with green chili . <sssss> it was the blandest food i 've ever eaten , and it was swimming in cheese . <sssss> there was no flavor at all in anything on the plate . <sssss> even chipotle is better . <sssss> my husband had avoided this place because its name is so stupid . <sssss> well , now we know the food is on the same level . <sssss> we went because they offer a drive-through window if you call ahead . <sssss> i think that 's the best thing i can say about it . 
2		went for the passover service and dinner - - a little expensive at $ 65 plus 20 % service charge . <sssss> good service , but the food was not very good . <sssss> would not recommend this at all . 
2		go to lee lee 's or mekong . <sssss> it is worth the drive . <sssss> i have been here several times in the past and apparently forgot what i was getting into again . <sssss> remembered walking out once before after the fact . <sssss> inside looked like a hurricane just hit and took out most of the aisles . <sssss> the floors and some of the meat cases were filthy . <sssss> i 've seen and been in a few hurricanes when i lived in houston as a kid in the 70 's and this was scary . <sssss> you could barely maneuver with all the stuff piled up everywhere and in the way . <sssss> just needed a couple items to complete my ingredients for a tasty schezuan dinner and did not want to drive all the way down to chandler - mesa area . <sssss> all i wanted was some schezuan pepper corns and some hot bean paste which they did not have . <sssss> did manage to score on some pickled peppers . <sssss> make sure and check the dates . <sssss> some items that i looked at were out of date by a few months . <sssss> the produce also looked a little withered and no longer what i call fresh . <sssss> service is poor to say the least . <sssss> the food manger just looked at me like i was from mars and seemed confused when i ask him for assistance . <sssss> it took me almost 20 minutes to get to the checkout counter . <sssss> once there , the bag dudes proceeded to make silly comments about the customers leaving and the cashier on the other hand could not keep her fingers out of her facial orifices . <sssss> maybe it was just an off day ... dim sum anyone ? 
2		geez , it only took them 20 seasons to actually become interesting and now kurt warner is probably going to retire , they 'll go back to be ignored . <sssss> they used to play home games where sometimes visiting fans outshouted the locals . <sssss> maybe now they 'll finally have an identity in the desert but it sure has taken them a long time to do that . 
2		cobblestone offers a high quality car wash along with a discounts at the gas pump . <sssss> our family has been coming here for about four years and for the most part we are happy with the service . <sssss> there are offers of discount coupons available both on-line and in mailed circulars . <sssss> the only drawback is the hard sell on custom work for glass nicks and upgrades . 
2		the food has lost quality ... way over priced ... smaller crowds reflect the growing trend of lost business ... small menue ... no fowl . <sssss> . <sssss> this was my last visit 
2		foods good and the service sucks ! 
2		broth is too salty . <sssss> beef in pho not always fresh . <sssss> spring rolls are not very fresh . <sssss> i 've eaten here 10xs . <sssss> go to tea light if u live in north phoenix . <sssss> i 've given up on this place . 
2		two stars due to overall disappointment in the venue . <sssss> pros : fish and chips were excellent in my opinion , and the bread pudding was outstanding . <sssss> cons : no one to even say `` hello '' when you come in the door . <sssss> just a greeter would be nice and helpful for a first timer . <sssss> service was spotty throughout the evening . <sssss> most wait staff are more than happy to bring you another drink before you finish the previous one to keep their bill moving up for a better tip , but that was n't the case here . <sssss> the biggest con was the music - first of all , waaaay too loud indoors . <sssss> this is n't a dance club , so it does n't need to dominate . <sssss> it was a conversation killer . <sssss> secondly , it 's st. patrick 's weekend , and we 're listening to country music ??? <sssss> it just did n't align for us . <sssss> an irish pub ca n't line up an irish folk singer for the weekend ? <sssss> i wo n't be back . 
2		not impressed ... i was in scottsdale for a few days on business and decided to get a relaxing pedicure in my free time . <sssss> after reading the reviews i decided to try pro nails by julie . <sssss> when i called to make an appt i specifically asked for julie since she is the one mentioned in most of the reviews . <sssss> the place is clean and they do have a nice selection of colors . <sssss> i sat down in the chair and was given a bottle of water which is a nice touch but when it came to the cuticle clipping and filing it was awful . <sssss> she hardly clipped my cuticles at all and she filed my toenails crooked and they were all different lengths !! <sssss> this is julie , the owner ? <sssss> i live in southern ca and you can go to any nail shop and get a better job for a much better price . <sssss> i paid $ 33 for basically a polish change and a little lotion on my legs and the massage that other yelpers reviewed about being so good ? <sssss> ummm not so much ... i really wish bliss wasnt booked solid i would have gladly paid an extra $ 20 for a good job . 
2		we were confronted yesterday with a very typical circumstance : on one side of the road was my big fat greek restaurant , and on the other , a small , independent kebab shop . <sssss> we rolled the dice and went with the previously unknown and unrecommended kebab shop . <sssss> bad move . <sssss> first off , the bread they brought us was disappointing to say the least . <sssss> next to that , the chicken dish i ordered was slow out of the kitchen and mediocre at best . <sssss> more importantly , though , was the general uncomfortable vibe we were marinating in throughout the course of our lunch . <sssss> the owners/managers spoke in obnoxious tones to their staff and something about the place in general gave us the heebie jeebies . <sssss> when our waitress finally returned with our check , we were already halfway out the door . 
2		not exactly what i expected . <sssss> all the ranting and raving i hear about this place , well it 's on the lower end of places where i would eat steak . <sssss> asked for medium steak and received closer to medium well . <sssss> do n't think i 'll be visiting any time soon . <sssss> creme brulee dessert was not better than the keg . 
2		what is going on with place ? <sssss> nobody answers the phone and there is no voice mail to indicate the hours of business ! <sssss> assuming that they would be open at 6pm , i drove all the way there to find out they were closed ! <sssss> last time i went here they were open until 8:30 pm . <sssss> and the icing on the cake is that no hours were even posted on their door . <sssss> so now i have wasted $ $ -lrb- on a package -rrb- , gas , and time . 
2		dirty , generic , and loud . <sssss> they have a few funky chairs in the corner , but they 're awkward and uncomfortable . <sssss> other than that , it 's a starbucks . 
2		i do n't get it !! <sssss> my husband , daughter and i went to eat at joe 's because we saw a menu in the hotel where we were staying nearby . <sssss> the menu mentioned that the tv show diners drive-ins and dives had done a show about the place and indicated the menu items that were highlighted on the show that were supposedly delicious ! <sssss> i called ahead for directions and was greeted with an attitude when i explained that we were from out of town , staying at a hotel that has their menu and needed directions to get there . <sssss> i assumed since the menu was in the hotel room that the employees at joe 's would know how to direct someone to get there from the hotel . <sssss> after i explained several times the cross streets and the name of the hotel where we were staying , explained that we were just north of the 202 freeway etc and was just about to give up , the girl finally was able to give me directions . <sssss> was that an omen of things to come ?? <sssss> the first irritation that we encountered was standing in line and trying to decide what we should order while there was only one cashier . <sssss> so when we did reach the window to place our order we could practically feel the irritation of the people waiting behind us while we tried to ask a few questions about the menu . <sssss> feeling pressure to hurry up by the impatient look on the cashiers face we ordered a variety of things for the three of us . <sssss> the fontina burger , pulled pork sandwich , onion rings , sweet potato fries and fresh beet salad . <sssss> with the variety of what we ordered you would think at least one of the three of us would taste something we liked , but the only adjective that we could come up with for everything was blah . <sssss> i am not exaggerating ... we were all hungry and we are not picky eaters , but we just could n't get a good bite of anything . <sssss> also when i placed our order i asked for side orders of the onions rings and sweet potato fries but the cashier rang up full orders which i did n't realize since my husband paid the bill not knowing it should have been less . <sssss> our bill for the 3 of us was equal to what we would pay at a restaurant with someone serving us !! <sssss> i would n't mind so much if the food tasted good but ... . <sssss> thefontina burger was cooked very well done -lrb- i ordered it medium/well -rrb- . <sssss> it had a very slight smear of pesto -lrb- so slight that i could n't even taste it -rrb- with a few small pieces of mushy grilled pepper and the fontina cheese . <sssss> the burger was so unremarkable that i ca n't even remember if there were `` greens '' on it our not . <sssss> i would describe this burger as dry and blah . <sssss> the onion rings had such a crunchy exterior that it actually hurt our mouths to bite into them . <sssss> besides that , the onion pieces were so thin you could hardly taste the onion . <sssss> it was like eating a basket full of crunchy fried breading . <sssss> the sweet potato fries and the white potato fries were also just blah ... how can you mess up fries ?? <sssss> after some serious thought we decided it had to be the type of oil that they were fried in . <sssss> it was just tasteless . <sssss> even salt and ketchup could n't help these fries ! <sssss> the bbq pork sandwich was just okay as was the coleslaw . <sssss> not really much to say about them . <sssss> the beet salad tasted like dirt . <sssss> my daughter and i both love beets but neither of us could take more than one bite of this salad . <sssss> the pickles that they put on top of everything are just gross . <sssss> what they heck is wrong with just a dill pickle ? <sssss> why the sweet and sour wierd flavor combo ?? <sssss> there is only one drink machine and condiment bar and it is outside ! <sssss> so to fill your drink or get your napkins and ketchup you have to go out the door and stand in line then try to get back in the door while juggling everything . <sssss> irritating ! <sssss> more irriation came in the form of the flies swarming our table which made for a very frustrating time of swatting them off of our food between bites . <sssss> we were all hungry but none of us finished our meal because we were just bored and frustrated trying to get a good bite . <sssss> we even tried to doctor stuff up by dipping our fries in the bbq sauce and adding ketchup to the burger but we just could n't fix any of it ! <sssss> we left feeling ripped off , vowed to never return and decided we deserved to stop for an ice cream someplace on our way back to the hotel to get that irritating , blah , sweet and sour , dirt flavor out of our mouths . <sssss> pay attention to the details would be my recommdendation to the staff of this place because everything really adds up or takes away from the dining experience . <sssss> we were overcharged , irritated by the set up , atmosphere and flies and we were still hungry when we left ! <sssss> i am submitting this review because i do n't want other people who have never eaten here before to be fooled by the food network show hype the way we were . <sssss> the only reason i gave two stars is because i like the `` farm fresh concept '' and wanted to give the place credit for that . 
2		i came here for the sunday brunch in july when my boyfriend visited me . <sssss> i got the benedict arnold plate and he got wing ding dang plate . <sssss> the tofu scramble that comes with every meal tastes only of tumeric . <sssss> not good . <sssss> they need to throw some kala namak in there to give it more of an authentic egg flavor . <sssss> the hash potatoes were okay - they really needed ketchup but no ketchup was to be found . <sssss> i tried one of my boyfriend 's wings and it was one of the foulest things i have ever tasted . <sssss> there was way too much vinegar in the sauce . <sssss> yet , he still somehow loved them . <sssss> i 'm convinced that boy has no taste whatsoever . <sssss> i 've never had nonvegan hollandaise sauce so i have nothing to compare it to , but the hollandaise sauce that came on my plate just tasted like mustard to me . <sssss> which , i imagine , is not the way hollandaise is supposed to taste . <sssss> despite all this , the donuts are to die for . <sssss> i got a maple bar and ohhhhhh my god ! <sssss> it tasted just like the real deal ! <sssss> i do n't know what they make their canadian bacon out of , but it is the best dang canadian bacon i have ever had ! <sssss> it tastes just like regular ham ! <sssss> on your way out , they also have some refreshing complimentary cucumber water which i really enjoyed . <sssss> i wish i could give this place more stars simply for being an all-vegan restaurant , but the food is either hit or miss . <sssss> would i come here again ? <sssss> absolutely . <sssss> but probably just for the amazing donuts and canadian bacon . <sssss> : ^ -rrb- 
2		this was my third time here its ok at best . <sssss> had the half rack of ribs bbq sauce was good -lrb- have had better -rrb- the ribs were very dry and very tough not like ribs should be . <sssss> my wife had the same hers were better her side of steemed broccoli was just drenched in butter made for a over powering taste , service was also bad i was without a drink for 10 minutes before it got refilled . <sssss> can only give cute girls so much room for error . <sssss> all in all i doubt we will be back again 
2		when we were looking for a restaurant near us , we came across this highly reviewed restaurant . <sssss> some reviews on another sites warned us about bad service . <sssss> going in , expecting bad service , i was still amazed . <sssss> we actually received no service . <sssss> we showed up with our 11 month old daughter . <sssss> we were warmly greeted by the hostess . <sssss> that was the last time anyone came to our table . <sssss> we sat there for 30 minutes before we asked for service . <sssss> the nice hostess ran away . <sssss> she came back and told us that our server would be right with us and asked if she could get us some water . <sssss> 10 minutes later , the server came out with water . <sssss> at that time we decided to go elsewhere . <sssss> however , considering all of the great reviews , we decided to give it another go . <sssss> this time we got take out . <sssss> we ordered three pizzas and i was underwhelmed . <sssss> the pesto pizza was the best that i tasted but i have had better . <sssss> i agree with d.d. who said that the pizza was bland . <sssss> ultimately , i do n't think that it is worth the effort . 
2		i was just there this morning . <sssss> and again about two weeks ago . <sssss> i think the food is still pretty good and they changed their stupid pricing policy about not being able to buy bbq at the deli and then sitting down and ordering some other dishes and eating some bbq that we just bought . <sssss> but my gripe this morning is the crappy customer service . <sssss> i hate to generalize , but many chinese restaurants have crappy attitudes about customers and feel that they are doing the customers a favor by taking our money and patronage . <sssss> i was there at 10 am the opening time to buy some bbq . <sssss> i waited until 10:10 before they opened the doors , although the people saw me standing there . <sssss> and when i walked in , it took them another five minutes to grumpily ask me what i wanted . <sssss> again , hate to generalize by many chinese and korean restaurants are like this . <sssss> why is that ? <sssss> must be the heritage or something . 
2		went during lunch time and serve was extremely slow . 
2		over rated beyond belief !! <sssss> the restaurant setting is unique in its cozy ambiance , but you pay $ 250 for two to eat good food not the ambiance . <sssss> our 30th anniversary , as a visitor to phoenix , was not something to be stamped out in our culinary diary as `` outstanding '' . <sssss> the staff has been trained to `` sell '' the `` goods '' , but the goods ' are not there to be sold . <sssss> upon our arrival , we were given the privilege of being seated in the patio area , provided we vacated the table in `` one hour forty minutes '' !! <sssss> our server was very accommodating , well informed and courteous , but the kitchen did not take any notice of his recommendations and most of our food had to be returned for revision . <sssss> the menu is structured around the fancy names , extravagant ingredients and presentation , but the quality and the `` yummy factor '' is just not there to match the intentions . <sssss> my wife 's orders had to be modified due to her numerous allegories , so in the spirit of fairness , i will only comment on my choices which were presented exactly as described on the menu . <sssss> the lobster appetizer starter , with a fancy name -lrb- $ 18 -rrb- turned out to be a few pieces of tasteless lobster meat in some kind of equally tasteless sauce buried in an unimpressive french bread and accompanied with soggy and limp french fries . <sssss> the main course , the stake -lrb- $ 38 + -rrb- was a lump of un-seasoned meat on a pile of fiery hot chilies and corn -lrb- out of a can -rrb- , with a failed attempt to camouflage the tasteless meat . <sssss> the reprieve came at the end of the meal . <sssss> the desert and espresso was well presented and very tasty . <sssss> if you are seeking bragging rights for a night out , this is your place . <sssss> on the other hand if you are after good food , look for an establishment serving a true gourmet product . <sssss> fred fardoost 
2		ok , so i hate to rain on your parade . <sssss> i have been to maxim in the past and agree that the food is delightful . <sssss> folks are right on regarding the scummy strip mall it is in and the dumpster being right next to the entrance of the place . <sssss> after reading several reviews and really wanting some noodles i decided to hit the place up yesterday . <sssss> first as i walked in the lady assisting me was not in the slightest bit friendly . <sssss> she kept doing this weird eye rolling thing as i asked her questions regarding the vermicelli noodles they had . <sssss> the thing that made me want to hurl was that as we were talking a baby roach climbed up on the counter and she saw that i was eyeing it . <sssss> she proceeded to mash it with the tip of her index finger and when it would n't come off she wiped the tip of her finger on the bin where dirty dishes are collected . <sssss> i tend to not be weak of stomach but that entire ordeal just did it for me . <sssss> not to mention she kept touching her nose . <sssss> i think overall i 'll just stick to other vietnamese spots that serve food just as good as theirs minus the baby roach . <sssss> i 'm just sayin ' ... 
2		i 'm actually surprised by the higher ratings . <sssss> we did n't think it was that great . <sssss> the staff was n't very knowledgeable about the sushi or the menu items . <sssss> anything we asked the response we got was in a bubbly voice of `` i do n't know ! '' <sssss> while i appreciate her friendliness and upbeat attitude i felt she should know more about the sushi and the dishes they serve . <sssss> my boyfriend got the orange glaze chicken . <sssss> it was ... okay , but definitely way over priced for what you got . <sssss> $ 8.50 for that dish and it was mostly rice and a salad with a bit of chicken . <sssss> the small salad was depressing looking with the unknown orange sauce -lrb- again , the server did n't know what it was but laughed about it -rrb- . <sssss> my bf did n't eat it so we 're still not sure what it was but it resembled thousand island . <sssss> the sushi was n't good either . <sssss> now we do have some friends who loved their sushi which is why we tried eastwind 's but for us it truly fell short . <sssss> we arrived right when they opened so all the sushi should have been prepared fresh and it definitely was n't . <sssss> the tempura was complete mush and the tastes just seemed truly off . <sssss> the flavors did n't blend and melt in your mouth at all . <sssss> i did enjoy the new york crunch roll , i believe was the name . <sssss> it was the one great roll in a line of unsatisfactory rolls . <sssss> the other sushi rolls were tasteless , mushy and seemed to have been from the prior day . <sssss> our favorite place is seksun sushi go-round on ray , just west of alma school . <sssss> we have been there over a dozen times and we 've never been disappointed . <sssss> give seksun a try ! 
2		roy 's is suppose to be good . <sssss> and being my first experience here , it was just terrible . <sssss> it was a fusion of untasteful flavors that was just disappointing . <sssss> starting with the drinks , the fruit drinks tasted very off in flavor ... chemical flavors , man ! <sssss> our entire party thought the food was mediocre and quite below par . <sssss> i ordered the szechuan peppercorn salmon dish with garlic rice and bak choy . <sssss> my expectations was a very spicy and tasty dish . <sssss> but instead , the berry toppings were overcooked and the salmon tasted like something i could make at home . <sssss> the appetizer platter we tried had a sweet and sour sauce , but it tasted more sour than anything . <sssss> eww ! <sssss> maybe that evening 's head chef did n't feel like cooking , but man the food was just bad . <sssss> would this deter me from another visit to roy 's ? <sssss> no . <sssss> but if i experience it again , roy 's will be off my list . 
2		nice facility . <sssss> however the batting cages are truly the worst i 've ever used . <sssss> i 've been twice now . <sssss> no matter which cages i use , the machine is extremely inconsistent . <sssss> out of your 14 balls per token , expect to get 3 or 4 `` strikes '' and the rest unhittable . <sssss> i like that they have multiple slow-pitch softball machines , but i feel like practicing on these machines is more likely to mess up my swing than improve it . <sssss> too bad , because the location is great and the rest of kiwanis park seems cool . 
2		first time i 've ever had an open table reservation not honored . <sssss> i 'm not sure what to think about these people . <sssss> i get there at 5:55 for a 6:00 reservation . <sssss> they do n't have a table . <sssss> 10 minutes later i 'm offered a high top . <sssss> seriously ? <sssss> is it just me or would n't you hold actual tables for opentable customers ? <sssss> anyway 6:25 we have a table . <sssss> food was ok at best . <sssss> the charcuterie plate might as well have been served on an oscar meyer plate . 
2		stopped in for lunch . <sssss> restaurant is large ; it 's hard to imagine there being much of a wait during prime dinner times . <sssss> the staff is friendly and attentive , but the food ... not so much . <sssss> chips are fine ; salsa is ok , and you also get a small bowl of warm refried beans . <sssss> prices are fair in regards to portion size . <sssss> i do like that the vegetables they use are very fresh ; i hate getting veggie enchiladas , etc. that use frozen , poorly cooked vegetables . <sssss> the zucchini was fresh , crisp , and pretty good . <sssss> the rice and beans were too salty in my opinion . <sssss> food was average at best . <sssss> definitely not the best mexican food i 've had ; i am surprised at the high rating . <sssss> however , service was good -lrb- our drinks were never empty , and we did n't have to ask for a refill on chips -rrb- . <sssss> the server also asked about how we wanted our check split , which helped avoid a lot of hassle . <sssss> not sure if i 'll be back , but definitely not a bad experience by any means . <sssss> just not my kind of food . 
2		went here for the xtra910 nfl draft party on 4/25 . <sssss> place is nice setup . <sssss> lots of beers on tap . <sssss> service or at least the server we had was horrible . <sssss> after 5 minutes of waiting for the server to come up , i placed my order for a coors light ... waited 15 minutes , then the server came back saying my beer must of been delivered to the wrong table , asked what i wanted and then i waited another 15 minutes before getting my first beer . <sssss> happy hour price of $ 3.50 for a pint of coors light is not the best , but ok . <sssss> we decided we wanted a round of shots and we were promptly told that they ca n't do that . <sssss> what a great drinking establishment . <sssss> no shots if you have beers . <sssss> well who the hell wants to wait 30 minutes between a beer and a shot , not me . <sssss> very disappointed with the service . <sssss> i really hope our server was having a horrible day because she was awful . 
2		i really think that 2 stars is a fairly generous rating for this restaurant given my recent experience here . <sssss> buy i will give points for the history and the ambiance , both of which i am very fond of . <sssss> the food , service and prices , however , were well off-base . <sssss> i took a group of out-of-town business associates here during a conference at the phoenix convention center . <sssss> i wanted to take them somewhere that is `` uniquely phoenix '' , and i felt that durant 's fit that description . <sssss> i have eaten here before , and i thought it was ok , but many of my same complaints were consistent on this visit . <sssss> first , i hate restaurants where the bar makes you close the tab with them before you head to your table . <sssss> any quality establishment should put the diner 's convenience before the bartenders tip and allow you to transfer your bar tab to your table bill . <sssss> on a business function , this makes accounting very sticky , and is awkward when you have to stop , ask for the bar bill , run your card , sign it , then proceed to your table . <sssss> i know that bartenders do it to maximize their tips -lrb- i used to be one -rrb- , but it is bush league , and should have no place in a restaurant like durants . <sssss> our waiter was flat out terrible . <sssss> this little weasel obviously did not want to be there and let the world know it . <sssss> not only was his attitude poor , but his timing was awful . <sssss> we sat for almost 3 hours , most of the time waiting for him to take orders or bring food . <sssss> we never saw the guy . <sssss> our drinks were rarely if ever full , but he was sure to try and up-sell more bottles of wine when the time came . <sssss> when you are paying that kind of money to eat in a place like durants , the server had better be representative of the price . <sssss> he was not . <sssss> durant 's has a very , very strange pricing scheme . <sssss> some things are priced well , other things are absolutely obnoxious . <sssss> specifically the appetizers are way out of line . <sssss> apps were in the $ 15 + range which is flat out absurd . <sssss> i dont mind paying for food , but i do expect value , and you will not find it at durants . <sssss> i ordered a stuffed potato with my steak instead of the standard baker and it was a $ 5 upgrade . <sssss> that is ridiculous . <sssss> the food was pretty good - the oysters rockefeller were outstanding and were clearly the best part of the dinner . <sssss> my steak , a $ 51 bone in ribeye , was on the poor side of average and worth about $ 11 . <sssss> very tough and fibrous , i was not impressed . <sssss> it was tasty , but i have had far , far better elsewhere on many occasions . <sssss> again , it was the value that annoyed me about this place . <sssss> avoid the crab macaroni and cheese at all costs . <sssss> horrible . <sssss> barely edible , no flavor , the large rigatoni 's didnt really go with the white cheese cream sauce and chunks of crab . <sssss> pretty bad . <sssss> i will say that the wine was very well priced , and we appreciated that . <sssss> once again , the inconsistency in pricing was perplexing . <sssss> the thing that really , really blew it for me though was the 48oz porterhouse challenge . <sssss> the thing is like $ 85 and `` if you can eat it all '' your name goes on the wall . <sssss> we bet one of my colleagues that he could not finish it , and each guy threw in $ 20 as a prize . <sssss> the steak arrived and it was about 35oz of bone and about 12oz of meat . <sssss> my mother could have finished that steak and ordered desert . <sssss> this is one of the biggest marketing scams that i have ever seen in a restaurant . <sssss> the whole `` challenge '' concept is obviously designed to get you to order an $ 85 steak . <sssss> my ribeye had more meat on it and was probably harder to eat . <sssss> we should have known what to expect when we asked the waiter how many people finish it , and he said `` about 5 people order it each day , and about 3 out of 5 finish it . '' <sssss> pathetic . <sssss> so if you are going out for a drink in phoenix , head to durants and have a martini at the bar . <sssss> order the oysters rockefeller while you are there . <sssss> these aspects of the restaurant are really , really great . <sssss> then finish your drink and head to another steakhouse for a great steak that will not disappoint you like durant 's . 
2		my rubric for a coffee shop is pretty simple . <sssss> the first and most important question is `` how 's the coffee ? '' <sssss> i ordered a regular drip coffee and the barista -lrb- who was very nice and eager to answer my questions -rrb- served it to me ... cold . <sssss> the hot drip coffee was cold . <sssss> and it tasted burnt . <sssss> bad on two counts . <sssss> my cohort ordered an espresso and was served promptly . <sssss> unfortunately , his espresso was also subpar due to it 's over-extraction . <sssss> the furniture was mismatched -lrb- but not in that fun , quirky way ... more of a `` we stopped by a garage sale and this is what we found '' way -rrb- . <sssss> the light fixtures were interesting but cast shadows directly on the artwork . <sssss> typically , i 'd say that 's bad form . <sssss> on a positive note , the concrete floors were nice , and i was partial to their rugs . <sssss> their menus looked like a ripoff of lux 's glass window pane menus , but their merch area felt like a cross section of a duty-free airport gift shop . <sssss> pairing that with the chairs from various time periods and places , urban beans felt like it was trying to be several different shops at once . <sssss> if you try to please everybody , you 'll please nobody . 
2		food is barely average and going down hill fast . <sssss> service is not great but they try . <sssss> but they might think of asking the waitress to shower once in a while . <sssss> gross . 
2		i really wanted to like this place , since it has such good reviews and nice happy hour prices ... but i just did n't . <sssss> the decor is rather lacking and the booths were uncomfortable . <sssss> the service was decent , not great . <sssss> we ordered gyoza , which was ok . <sssss> it 's pan fried instead of deep fried , so it 's not very crunchy . <sssss> we also ordered a volcano roll and a rainbow roll , the rainbow roll was n't that good , the shrimp on it was chewy and the avocado tasted a bit old . <sssss> they brought us a thunder roll instead of a volcano roll . <sssss> i 'd been debating between the two so i thought i 'd ordered the wrong thing and did n't make an issue of it , but when we got the receipt it said we had , in fact , ordered the volcano roll . <sssss> the thunder roll was , again , just ok . <sssss> the tea and miso soup were good . <sssss> all in all we just were n't impressed and we wo n't be going back . 
2		my girlfriend had 2 skirts altered by this place . <sssss> both for work purposes . <sssss> the reason i am posting about this and not her is because i was the one who had to go pick it up and pay for it . <sssss> i was amazed at how much it had cost for two business style skirts to get altered . <sssss> they had both sides taken in -lrb- to make smaller -rrb- . <sssss> $ 36 a skirt for a grand total of $ 72 . <sssss> i came with $ 45 thinking that would cover the `` cash only '' rule that still exists in today 's world . <sssss> so then i had to leave , go to an atm then back to the place . <sssss> thinking the whole time , `` might as well go buy her a new skirt , '' but i have no fashion and she needed them ! <sssss> so two weeks later and $ 72 in the hole we have skirts that fit . <sssss> is it great work yes . <sssss> the people were really nice . <sssss> if i needed it done over night i would probably pay that price . <sssss> inflating prices because of slow business . <sssss> business denied 
2		why did i think going here was a good idea ? <sssss> for some reason , i thought that mellow mushroom was going to be some kind of pizza bistro , with emphasis on the 60 's . <sssss> boy was i wrong . <sssss> first off , this sports bar does n't know what it is . <sssss> being a graphic designer , i know about the funky concept of branding , which this upscale tgi-fridays completely tosses out the window . <sssss> from the 60 's font on the outside of the building , to the modern skyline artwork on the walls , to the 10 different genres of t-shirts the servers wear , this place is chaotic and terrifying . <sssss> and the food experience was even worse . <sssss> first off , we got the artichoke dip , which was ok . <sssss> it was hot , which was nice , but i prefer a nice crust on the top of mine , which did n't happen . <sssss> then came the 45 minute wait for our pizza , which was then delivered to another table . <sssss> 15 minutes after that , our server realized what happened , and to be fair , she was very apologetic , and it was n't her fault , it was the fault of the runners . <sssss> so , they made up another pie , and a manager gave us a comp meal and 2 free pizzas , which is nice and earns them a star . <sssss> as for the pizza , we got the buffalo chicken pizza , which really needed more chicken and hot sauce . <sssss> most of what i had was a cheese & ranch pizza . <sssss> the chicken was tasty , though very sparse , and the hot sauce was tangy , which is what i expect . <sssss> i only wish there was more . <sssss> the dough was very good though , and the pizza tasted decently cold the next morning . <sssss> slight hints of sweetness come through the crust , which was nice . <sssss> however , the disaster that occurred there , along with the schizophrenic atmosphere has chased me away for good . <sssss> i will be using those coupons though when the time arises . <sssss> lastly , looking around at other tables , i do not recommend the pretzels . <sssss> i see that there is an image of them on here , do not be fooled . <sssss> i see no reason to have to wait 20 minutes for pretzels that are not even the size of a hand . 
2		as an arizona native , i have been going to the improv for years . <sssss> i 'm sorry to say that although it showcases some big names , the talent and atmosphere has really gone downhill . <sssss> despite the increase in comedy theatres in the east valley , the improv has not decreased their prices or upgraded the experience . <sssss> i can go to three other comedy clubs in the area for $ 5-10 cheaper , and lmao ... which is the point ! <sssss> the last show i went to , i spent premium pricing to see david spade , and i have to say it was joke . <sssss> the show started about 30 minutes late and he appeared to be pretty intoxicated . <sssss> it was n't funny at all . <sssss> after that debacle , i held off on the improv for a while and just hit up the other comedy clubs when i needed a laugh . <sssss> we decided to give the improv another shot on friday , because we really wanted to see michael mcdonald . <sssss> i have nothing bad to say about any of the acts , unfortunately i could n't enjoy them because i was trying to make my way through the worst martini i 've ever had ... -lrb- cucumber -rrb- . <sssss> on top of it being awful , it was $ 12 -lrb- of course there was no pricing listed -rrb- . <sssss> what a rip-off ! <sssss> the terrible martini was not the worst of it , we were forced to share a table with another couple ... okay not so bad , except they had us all packed in like sardines . <sssss> the whole set up was ridiculous . <sssss> no one 's chairs were actually facing the stage . <sssss> i had so much back pain from having to twist around to see the comics , -lrb- because there was not enough room to move my chair -rrb- that i just wanted the show to end so i could leave . <sssss> to make matters worse , when we did leave , we realized that a large number of tables were actually left empty ... so i went through all that discomfort for nothing ! <sssss> big boo for the improv ... save your money and go somewhere else ! 
2		meh ... definitely the word to best describe this joint . <sssss> for $ 7.30 not including a drink you get a noodle bowl . <sssss> you also get to get in on their asian-style fried chicken wings , egg rolls , soups , jello , and fried biscuits with sugar . <sssss> for 2 people and 1 drink our total came out to $ 18.00 number 1 boo on the fact they do n't allow takeout dishes for an additional fee like all of the other mongolian bbq places . <sssss> number 2 boo on the fact that its a little steep in price for 1 bowl of freakin noodles with no dream of a doggie bag number 3 boo on the fact that all the servers and cooks have these odd blank stares the entire time we were dining number 4 boo and i know its gross but i got ta keep it real here ... we had violent urges to go to the bathroom soon after with pushes of ... ahem ... wind smelling of noodles ... perhaps the biggest poo . <sssss> . <sssss> i mean boo of all =-lrb- and no we didnt `` fill up '' on a most enormous amount of noodles to deliver such ridiculous movements as our serving sizes were reasonable . <sssss> however i can not boo on their fried chicken wings . <sssss> they were absolutely delicious . <sssss> although one more boo on them for making us wait 10 minutes for more . <sssss> mediocre mongolian bbq . <sssss> . <sssss> meh 
2		i ca n't say i found the food to be anything other than `` very '' americanized chinese food . <sssss> on the positive side , the staff are nice and the prices are extremely cheep . 
2		ok ... you 'd think by all the hype about this place it would be good . <sssss> eh ... not so much . <sssss> if you 're looking to drink ... this place rocks . <sssss> if your looking to eat . <sssss> . <sssss> stay away . <sssss> the food here is half-rate at best . <sssss> they bar and physical building is pretty cool and hip . <sssss> but , if i want to go to a bar , there are so many other places to go . <sssss> if they got their menu and kitchen staff up to par , this could be an excellent place . <sssss> please fire your chef and get a new menu asap !!! 
2		very cute locale and pleasant waitresses . <sssss> food was mediocre . 
2		i hate having to write this review , but i will stick to the facts ! <sssss> the weather was beautiful last night , so thought we would ride the light rail to tempe and enjoy some drinks and food on a patio . <sssss> i 've always been intrigued by the depot cantina , so that is where we decided to go . <sssss> we found a nice table on the patio and we were off to a good start . <sssss> but , it all went downhill from there ... the service was so terribly slow and she did n't really apologize for it . <sssss> it took us 15 minutes to get our drinks and then another 10 to get our food order in ... only because i asked another server to help us . <sssss> they cranked the music too loud and it caused it to cut in and out . <sssss> we told multiple servers multiple times that if they turned the music down it would go back to normal ... took 30 minutes for that to be fixed . <sssss> the food was just ok and the presentation was not impressive . <sssss> the soup was spilled all over the plate beneath it and they just threw a few tortillas on my friend 's burro ... seriously no attention to detail in this place . <sssss> i ca n't imagine a manager was on duty last night because i ca n't imagine they would let the restaurant run this way . <sssss> i hope they get their act together because this place is in a great location with a large patio . 
2		9/23 had a friend meet me here for restaurant week . <sssss> we both were n't dressed for the phoenician , but i did n't care -lrb- and soon , he did n't either -rrb- . <sssss> it 's a good thing , too , bec . <sssss> in the end , we found that this place was n't ostentatious nor that pretentious . <sssss> dressed casually , we still managed to have a good time , despite the overall lackluster dining experience . <sssss> first off , let me say that the service could pick up their heels a bit . <sssss> by the time we received our expensive alcoholic beverage choices , more than 20 minutes had elapsed . <sssss> -lrb- $ 15 for a glass of cab and $ 11 for a tiny glass of mimosa ? <sssss> are you serious ?? -rrb- <sssss> our first plate , a sub-par caesar salad , arrived close to an hour after we were seated . <sssss> but perhaps the fault was n't entirely j&g 's ... digestif 's caesar salad pretty much demolished all other competitors , i 'd say . <sssss> how about i testify that tonight 's salad was crispy . <sssss> that 's saying something nice , right ? <sssss> no flavor , no creamy eggy goodness , but somewhat crispy . <sssss> the decimated croutons did n't help the situation ... for the entree , we had the skirt-steak & frites . <sssss> the latter were n't any better than what you would find at mcdonalds ' . <sssss> -lrb- seriously , i 'm not making this up . <sssss> just check out the photos and you 'll see i 'm all about the truth ! -rrb- <sssss> but the skirt steak ! <sssss> this baby was n't much to gaze at , but it was tasty . <sssss> let 's just say it was delicious enough for me not to cry over the expense we spent that night on a barely-touched salad , a cheap cut of steak , three beverages , and tip . <sssss> now onto the star of the show ... chocolate cake w / caramel ice cream ! <sssss> wait for it ... homemade caramel ice cream ! <sssss> and chocolate-lava cake shaped like a star . <sssss> oh . <sssss> my . <sssss> freakin ' . <sssss> god . <sssss> this should be renamed `` foreplay . '' <sssss> nice ambience , despite it being darker than i would like and that we were seated far away from the panoramic views . <sssss> i appreciated the privacy , though . <sssss> women 's restroom was clean and orderly , and walking past little caches of wine bottles was a nice touch . <sssss> the grounds looked pretty , but i was more impressed w / the property at the arizona grand ... 
2		this is the perfect example of a time i wish there was a ` half star ' policy . <sssss> that does n't happen to me very often as i 'm rather opinionated and deliberate and honestly , in the interest of maintaining those qualities , i just ca n't give stingray 3 + stars ... so 2 it is . <sssss> where to begin . <sssss> the food was fine ... choosing to dine at a place like stingray , i 'm well aware of what i 've signed up for . <sssss> meaning pedestrian , cookie cutter , ` safe ' sushi , with lots of rolls covered in some form of mayo or sweet eel sauce . <sssss> nothing you ca n't douse in loads of wasabi soy sauce and call ` okay ' . <sssss> very ra-esque or kona style stuff we 're talking about here . <sssss> i actually like that kind of easypeasy ` sushi ' sometimes . <sssss> just bring me more wine so i can google eye at my fiance across the table and we 're fine . <sssss> that said , the experience was still severely lacking in many areas . <sssss> someone needs to tell the staff at stingray that it 's no longer 2004 . <sssss> everything from the decor to the servers uniforms to their air of pretension screamed mortgage boom . <sssss> a time when everyone thought they were millionaires in training , had $ 850 a month car payments , raging strip club habits and not a lick of common sense . <sssss> guess what guys , those days are long gone . <sssss> the service was just plain not good . <sssss> think pretty and vapid . <sssss> all style -lrb- though , honestly , there was no real ` style ' going on -rrb- and no substance . <sssss> what i can only assume was the manager dropped our check off and did n't look in our direction or say a word . <sssss> it was rude and weird , almost as if we should feel special to be allowed to dine in their establishment . <sssss> our server appeared to be pretty young and i try to give a little leeway to the young and dumb but it was pretty evident that the young part was coincidental . <sssss> she was a dolt , complete with eyes rolling around in her head like creepy little black marbles ... ugh . <sssss> how this girl has survived on the planet this long is beyond me , what with busy streets to cross and rohypnol availability and all . <sssss> i dunno , the whole thing was just uncomfortable and strange . <sssss> luckily as soon as we walked out the door all was restored with the universe . <sssss> it was 2011 again , we were all poor , people were still being foreclosed on and i was still 35 ... meh . <sssss> whatever , i was glad to be living in the present and i doubt i 'll time travel via stingray sushi again anytime soon . 
2		wait , is this a joke ? <sssss> i feel like i 'm five years old again with my menu on the placemat . <sssss> how come i do n't get the free box of crayons ? <sssss> wait , there are only like three things to choose from ? <sssss> pizza , calzone , salad . <sssss> seriously ? <sssss> wait , how come there 's no sauce on my pizza and the crust is so thin there are holes in it ? <sssss> why does the chicken taste like rubber ? <sssss> went here on new years eve and the atmosphere was like a freakin ' funeral home . <sssss> lots of stuck up scottsdale people drinking robert mondavi wine and acting very proper . <sssss> next time i want pizza i 'll be at domino 's . 
2		wow ... being from new england area `` mass-hole '' , i usually am pretty lenient to places since we are `` land locked '' . <sssss> . <sssss> sourdough bread to start . <sssss> . <sssss> hard exterior , did not taste anything close to fresh , , anyways , , looking over the menu , and was a little shocked . <sssss> . <sssss> prices higher than `` pappadeaux '' n thinking the food quality better match . <sssss> . <sssss> appetizer pei mussels - decent flavor , but 1/3 look over dehydrated , almost as if they were dead way before cooking time . <sssss> or recooked or something , , those we un-edible . <sssss> wife got the clam chowder which was actually really good . <sssss> . <sssss> hence 2 stars i thought , 22 bucks for some scallops , , hmm , let me try that out . <sssss> . <sssss> huge plate came out with these little marble sized scallops , 12 of them . <sssss> . <sssss> thats almost 2 dollars a piece for each lil scallop , side zuchini was ok , but the cole slaw definitely not great , , some bites had that sour weird rubberband taste , , waitress , awesome , always smiling , refilling our drinks , , finished with a $ 60 bill , , not even close to satisfied and never going back . <sssss> . <sssss> if you want seafood on the east valley , go ahead n hit up red lobster , if you want some great seafood , hit up n. phoenix to pappadeaux -lrb- worth the drive and time , will never be dissatisfied -rrb- lesson learned . <sssss> : - -lrb- 
2		this place was extremely disappointing . <sssss> the chopped salad was the only good thing . <sssss> . <sssss> everything else had a similar `` smoked '' flavor that was n't good . <sssss> do n't get the olives , tomato soup , mixed nuts , etc. . <sssss> maybe it needs a little more time to get the kitchen up to par but this was no where near as good as citizen public house and i hear they are the same owners . 
2		i 've finally been there enough times to realize that i do n't like it . <sssss> the beans are bland and the rice is salty . <sssss> the salsa is n't right , either . <sssss> they have all of the typical tacos , enchiladas , and other stuff you 'll find in a similar mexican place , it 's just not as good . <sssss> the service is sub-par . <sssss> i 've noticed that the bussers do their thing right ; refilling water , cleaning up , etc. . <sssss> the servers are happy to take their time with everything and leave you hanging . <sssss> the last few times i went to this place , it was the decision of someone else . <sssss> i 'm not going back . 
2		food : mediocre , menu is pretty extensive for a small chinese joint , basic lunch menu for under $ 6 . <sssss> i typically come here with my co-workers and we do it family style . <sssss> service : mediocre , not too much too complain about , generally nice when ordering ambiance : dive -lrb- x3 -rrb- inside and out , same goes for the parking lot . <sssss> while its a pretty small place , they do have tables that can accommodate a group of 12 . <sssss> conclusion : while the food and service is a respectable 3 and 1/2 stars , the overall dingy appearance inside and out brings it down to a 2-star . <sssss> i have noticed a bug crawl up one of the picture frames one time in the dining room . <sssss> i have not been back since . 
2		this theatre is a great place to go catch a movie if you want to have dinner and drinks afterward on mill avenue . <sssss> if not , you should go to another theatre . <sssss> also , if you do n't like to fight crowds to watch a movie , then this would be a good theatre . <sssss> it never seems very crowded . <sssss> first , no stadium seating . <sssss> i think i 'm spoiled because back in ohio , all of our amc theatres had stadium seating . <sssss> the chairs were nice and comfy and made you want to snuggle in them especially if the movie was going to be 2 + hours . <sssss> the harkins on mill has the old movie theatre seats , and i had to move around quite a bit during our 1 hour and 40 minute movie so my butt would n't fall asleep . <sssss> second , only one concession stand was open and the selection was pretty limited . <sssss> prices were standard movie theatre prices ... my medium drink was $ 4.00 . <sssss> the worst part of this theatre is that because it is located so close to asu , it means that annoying frat-tastic douchebags go to this theatre to watch movies . <sssss> you know , the really annoying guys who a -rrb- feel that they are the only person there so they talk super loud before the movie starts , as if i really care about their sex life , b -rrb- talk incessently through the movie , as if i really care about their feelings on what is going on , and c -rrb- get up constantly during the movie because they probably snuck beer into the theatre and now have to go to the bathroom . <sssss> the few times i have gone here to watch a movie , i have been stuck with these kind of guys in the theatre and it makes the experience horrible . <sssss> i mean , if i 'm already watching a crappy movie -lrb- ahem , spiderman 3 -rrb- , i do n't want to have it worsened with jerks chit-chatting through the movie . 
2		was craving a torta tuesday night 7/3 , and i knew that my fave was already closed by 830pm -lrb- tortas el guero -rrb- . <sssss> also had my g/f that night , who 'd never had one . <sssss> she ordered the paquime , and i had the cubano w/o beans . <sssss> i was highly disappointed . <sssss> those two sandwhiches are nowhere approaching the same league as my fave , or tortas del rey . <sssss> tiny , thin , and so-so on the taste . <sssss> my g/f loved hers , and kept wondering why i was disappointed . <sssss> on july 4th , i called and found t el g was open , and i promptly took her there . <sssss> then , and only then , with close comparison , could she understand the vast chasm of difference between a true torta , and those two jokers we had the night before . <sssss> now , i want to be clear i 'm only disappointd in their sandwhiches . <sssss> the place is large , clean , friendly and open late . <sssss> i saw a salad and a plate dish or two coming out of that kitchen for which i will return to sample.it 's just that when i want a real - deal torta , it wo n't be there . 
2		slow service in the bar when there was no other patrons . <sssss> i 've been to frank & albert 's many times , but what i 've found is that unless your over the age of 55 and wearing designer clothing the staff would rather not serve you . <sssss> the food was fairly good and the atmosphere nice . <sssss> the prices are reasonable , however i probably wo n't return . 
2		food was good . <sssss> service very slow , even on slow monday afternoon ! <sssss> had 4 cabo wabo margaritas & not pleased w the fact that i dont even have a buzz . <sssss> $ 80 bill & no buzz = 2 stars . <sssss> i mean u shld really kno how to make a descent margarita for a `` sandbar . '' <sssss> . <sssss> ambiance was ok . <sssss> expected more sand ... & shade . 
2		it 's a hooters ... so yea greasy food , cheap beer , tight shirts . <sssss> ya dig ? <sssss> maybe do n't bring your girlfriend on the first date . <sssss> good place to watch a sports game with pals . <sssss> service is friendly , all of the girls are very amicable . <sssss> welcome to hooters . 
2		i like the design of this place . <sssss> it has a huge outdoor patio area , plus balcony , plus indoor seating . <sssss> we were seated pretty quickly and our server was fairly prompt with our drinks and order even though it was busy . <sssss> i ordered the vanna white veggie wrap which is described as grilled veggies and feta cheese in a wrap . <sssss> unfortunately there were no grilled veggies in it ! <sssss> it was filled about 85 % with lettuce and raw , red onion . <sssss> the rest was cold black beans , corn , and zucchini and a very light sprinkle of feta . <sssss> the fries and coleslaw were good . <sssss> ketchup and mustard bottles on the table were on their last leg and basically empty . <sssss> bathrooms were very dirty with broken soap dispensers , broken door locks and sanitary bins hanging sideways by one last bolt . <sssss> i want to like this place more , but it felt like no one cared anymore about general upkeep and food quality . <sssss> too bad . 
2		i 've now shopped here twice . <sssss> twice now i 've walked around this place trying aimlessly to find something worth buying . <sssss> it 's futile for me . <sssss> now we have two `` specialty '' marts in downtown -lrb- the phoenix public market being the other -rrb- that do nothing to add the the sustainability of cenpho . <sssss> sucks to be us . <sssss> we really need a full service store . <sssss> come on fresh & easy ! <sssss> the market is ready and waiting ! 
2		it 's not the people , but how the bank itself runs that pisses me off . <sssss> the fees , the red tape , the general bs i seem to have problems with these buttheads . <sssss> i have three -lrb- 3 -rrb- business accounts here and they tell me time - and-again that i need to open a personal account to cash my paycheck with them . <sssss> i own my business , the check is from them bofa , it 's made out to me . <sssss> f *** ers give me my money , it 's mine not yours . 
2		lonnie 's has a nice supply of materials and tools , and if you 're into jewelry-making , you 'll probably find something to buy there . <sssss> unfortunately , you 're gon na have to wait for it . <sssss> service is slow , and not always friendly . <sssss> the staff generally wo n't look at or speak to you as you stand there waiting for the interminable line to move , and they are n't any nicer when it is your turn . <sssss> i 've been there many times , and this is the case every . <sssss> effing . <sssss> time . <sssss> service is important to me , so i only go to lonnie 's when i need something now and they happen to be open . <sssss> otherwise , i 'd rather give my money to people with manners . 
2		meh , it 's alright . <sssss> honestly , after a couple of slices , every pizza tastes the same . <sssss> they do have a large variety though and on request , they can make a special pizza for you . <sssss> overall , it 's an ok place when you wan na spend about $ 7 
2		my husband really likes this place , he likes the # 1 . <sssss> i think the fries are good . <sssss> i have had a pizza silce , it was ok . <sssss> i also found the service slow and unfriendly . 
2		the only good thing i can say was the service was fast . <sssss> the food was pretty bad , i would not go there again . 
2		i tried yum yum right before a movie at tempe marketplace . <sssss> i ordered a combo plate with chow mien , orange chicken , beef broccoli and bbq pork . <sssss> you can get several types of combo platters with either chow mien , rice or fried rice . <sssss> the chow mein had almost no flavor . <sssss> probably the worst chow mien i can recall having in some time or ever . <sssss> the beef broccoli was good and flavorful , but not means exceptional . <sssss> i wish there was a bit more beef . <sssss> the bbq tasted pretty good , but had quite a bit of fat/gristle on my pieces . <sssss> not a fan of that . <sssss> i had to nibble around the fat pieces . <sssss> the orange chicken was superb ! <sssss> i would go back for this item . <sssss> compared to other buffet , fast food chinese places , yum yum falls short in the number of menu items and quality of their food . <sssss> the dining area is pretty big and has a tv . <sssss> drinks are from the fountain . <sssss> overall , some menu items were good , but others were sub-par . <sssss> 2.5 
2		extremely over-rated , not at all worth the hype or the price . <sssss> would not recommend this place to anyone - unless you are truly desperate to waste your money . 
2		i was worried when i walked in because of the cheesy decor you might find in a chain . <sssss> this place is pretty good - i am a spicy addict . <sssss> however , with so many other great mexican choices in the area , it may be a while before i go back . 
2		stayed here this past tuesday night . <sssss> the light rail is close by -lrb- right across the street -rrb- which is a big plus and the hotel is pretty clean and nice . <sssss> the issue is with the noise ! <sssss> you can hear the light rail and on occasion , aircraft taking off from sky harbor airport ! <sssss> it 's a noisy hotel ! <sssss> be warned ! 
2		worth a visit for the atmosphere and the beer . <sssss> the food was just ok . <sssss> even the famous chili was so-so . <sssss> yeah , it was damn hot . <sssss> but not that tasty . <sssss> the waitress we had was indifferent and acted as if we were an inconvenience . <sssss> i would n't go back . 
2		lets start with the positives . <sssss> the staff here is super friendly . <sssss> everyone behind the counter is in good spirits and looks to be enjoying their time as much as possible during work hours . <sssss> they also have free peanuts upon arrival , much to the like of the teakwoods bar establishment in the valley . <sssss> those would be the two positives encompassing the lack of just wiping the floor with five guys and giving them the one star rating . <sssss> i ordered the normal burger , which is actually two patties as opposed to the little burger which is just one patty . <sssss> i added the bacon , grilled mushrooms , grilled onions lettuce , tomato , and light mayo . <sssss> i made sure to ask for light mayo , because there does not need to a gallon of it on my hamburger , like most places in town like to garner . <sssss> of course i am going to try the french fries , so an order of those went on the bill to conclude . <sssss> after a short wait , i collected my order and proceeded to survey the land . <sssss> the hamburger is tasteless , there is no other way to say it . <sssss> it is not good . <sssss> its not an opinion , this burger is just plain garbage . <sssss> perhaps the staff could take the half gallon of salt they are putting on the fries and move a partial amount to the meat , because there is quite simply no seasoning and thus no taste . <sssss> ah yes , a nice treat , my light mayo was in fact slathered all over the top and bottom of the bun , always fun to take the mass napkins given to me to deconstruct the burger , wipe off superfluous mayo and return burger to original state . <sssss> i took two bites and through the burger away , its just not good . <sssss> the fries are decent , i suppose . <sssss> maybe i was just really hungry from not eating the burger i had such high hopes to enjoy . <sssss> so much for five guys , total bust . <sssss> note of review , the establishment does happen to have those cool tech soda machines that let you mix all sorts of different soft drinks together . <sssss> i made a 50/50 coke zero lemon/lime mix . <sssss> take my advice , avoid this place and make the trek to zinburger , you will not be sorry . 
2		to salvation army : do n't you want my money to do good ? <sssss> you have some furniture and knick knacks that i wanted , but for whatever reason you seemed not to want me to buy them . <sssss> the store clerks were watching tv and talking in the mock living room setting . <sssss> i even checked with them to see if they worked there so that i could get some assistance . <sssss> assistance is not what i got . <sssss> there was a broken down couch and a broken down chair for sale for $ 300 !! <sssss> i thought i might be able to afford the arm chair -lrb- which is actually all i wanted -rrb- so i asked if i could only buy the chair . <sssss> the guy just gave me a short `` no . '' <sssss> i asked why , and he just told me meanly that `` they do n't do that . <sssss> it 's a set , take it or leave it '' . <sssss> i 'm sorry ... did i stumble into crate and barrel ? <sssss> i kinda wish i had , i might of gotten nicer service . <sssss> next time i need to thrift it up , i 'll go to good will . <sssss> change the tune salvation army , you 're no sisters attic . <sssss> - whitney 
2		bus load , after bus load , after bus load of kids with few adults to manage them . <sssss> holy cow , what a disaster . <sssss> throwing balls , running kids , and no adults from the schools nor enough science museum staff to manage it all . <sssss> this was quite an annoying experience , and hard to enjoy the exhibits . <sssss> they really need to get this under control . 
2		got my nails done on friday and by monday they were chipped . <sssss> pedicure lasted less than 2 weeks . <sssss> the # 4 pedicure is wonderful but not enough to keep me coming back . 
2		i had written a review when i returned home ca n't find it on here . <sssss> the place is pretty but internet is horrible . <sssss> spent every morning trying to get someone to help us get connected even though it was paid . <sssss> do n't order room service . <sssss> we did a lot and the staff left our trays there overnight . <sssss> was swarmed by birds and their poo was all over table chairs tray . <sssss> this napped twice i had to return tray clean up poop . <sssss> not what u want to do at several hundreds dollars a night ... front desk was n't too concerned ... do n't know if ill would stay there again ... . <sssss> . 
2		as with many asian restaurants in the valley , meh , meh , meh , meh ... in other words , just ok . <sssss> you wo n't be wowed nor grossed out from eating here . <sssss> you can get your dim sum fix and forget about it . <sssss> perhaps if you 're new to chinese food or looking or something outside of panda express , you may find this place decent before going back for the orange chicken at panda . 
2		well , it 's been a little over a year since visiting this nearest to my house buffet , so i dropped in here today joined by mike c. to see how they 're doing . <sssss> the good : * friendly host . <sssss> :--rrb- * low price of $ 6.88 / 6.30 sr. including beverage . <sssss> :--rrb- * moderate selection of 64 food items , plus sauces & dressings . <sssss> * good drink selection including coffee & horchata . <sssss> :--rrb- * good food overall , including treats such as albondigas soup , jalapeño chicken , pork spare ribs , & rich , tasty soft ice cream . <sssss> :--rrb- then why only 2 stars , you ask ? <sssss> ¿ ? <sssss> well ... * there 's a snarky smell to this place . <sssss> it was here last year too , although i did n't include it in my review . <sssss> has the carpeting ever been cleaned in this place ? <sssss> it does n't look like it ! <sssss> :-o * the men 's bathroom is a disaster case with graffiti all over the place . <sssss> :-o * four tvs now blab away , all in spanish , & all on different station ! <sssss> :-o whatever . 
2		what happened to all of the coverage on the local sports ? <sssss> the arcadia news used to be very supportive and involved in arcadia high school athletics . <sssss> no articles and only some pictures of some of the sports these days . <sssss> should n't a local paper support its local high school ? 
2		pizza is good and wings are just right ! <sssss> . <sssss> 2 stars for great pizza and wings . <sssss> minus 3 stars for being so filthy and dirty this place is super dirty . <sssss> get your pizza and wings to go 
2		i usually love qt . <sssss> but this one scares me . <sssss> it 's always busy , and i guess for them , that 's a good thing . <sssss> once i had to pee really badly , and i 'm usually okay with the cleanliness of qt restrooms . <sssss> but when i went to grab a seat cover , a frikken syringe fell to the ground ! <sssss> yikes ! <sssss> get me outta here ! <sssss> o. 0 that was a long time ago , but i still avoid this qt if i can . 
2		lola 's coffee is better than fair trade coffee -lrb- 4 blocks away -rrb- . <sssss> other than that , it 's just a coffee shop , nothing more , nothing less . <sssss> one couch , two comfy chairs a table and the rest are rather ridged metal chairs . <sssss> the high ceiling gives the place a airy if not vacant feel . <sssss> they do have lots of space for laptops and lots of outlets to go with . <sssss> the coffee is ... well ... it 's coffee . <sssss> nothing outstanding nothing horrible , but it does n't come anywhere near the awesomeness of lux or conspire . <sssss> the the biggest complaint i have is they only have one set of stereo speakers so the music comes from one area of the room and just bounces around the single room venue . 
2		mixed feelings about this place . <sssss> good food was a plus for sure and the outdoor patio is very pleasant . <sssss> drinks and food are pricey but thats to be expected but the service really blew . <sssss> we were with a large group but man the waitress never even came to my end of the table except for my initial order , i had to get up twice to get service and they never even brought chips and salsa . <sssss> we were the last table in the place and they practically ignored our table . <sssss> wont be returning with so many choices . 
2		i rent from enterprise all the time . <sssss> i just was n't feeling the customer service love so i split & hit another enterprise . 
2		quality of food is good overall , although nuking your food in the microwave is not unknown -lrb- `` we do n't have an oven hot enough to heat it in less than 30 minutes '' -rrb- on a kasha knish . <sssss> they nickel and dime -lrb- one dollar for a bagel and a buck 99 for a bagel with butter -rrb- . <sssss> look carefully on the menu if you want to know that it costs an extra buck for a pastrami/corned beef sandwich . <sssss> the owner wo n't tell you until after she 's run your card . <sssss> i mean the printed menu . <sssss> the giant one in your face does n't mention it . 
2		being the only gay bar in scottsdale aside from bs west , i 've found myself at forbidden a few times . <sssss> forbidden is an ambitious concept -- a gay club with two rooms and two deejays in a city not known for its gay nightlife . <sssss> sadly forbidden does not deliver . <sssss> the club is usually pretty busy on a saturday night , but the crowd leaves a bit to be desired . <sssss> the patrons are mostly unattractive , kind of trashy in fact , and not very friendly . <sssss> i believe deejay in the main room does not change on the weekends , where he spins top 40 dance/pop to a drunk college-aged crowd . <sssss> in the oz room -lrb- the smaller room -rrb- they have different local deejays , who , from what i 've seen , spin a variety of different types of music -- sometimes it 's circuity music , sometimes it 's eighties music , it all depends on the deejay for that night . <sssss> the oz room has been pretty empty the few times i 've been there . <sssss> the sound system in both rooms leaves quite a bit to be desired from a place that calls itself a club . <sssss> the drinks are reasonably priced for a bar in scottsdale . <sssss> the décor is okay , but not very interesting . <sssss> forbidden is n't terrible . <sssss> it is , however , just plain boring -lrb- bad music on a bad sound system , uninteresting décor , and an unimpressive and unfriendly crowd -rrb- ! 
2		fell into the `` it was on food network so let 's visit '' trap . <sssss> it was an okay breakfast , but the service was pretty lackluster . <sssss> not worth driving from phoenix for the food , however ; the drive itself is very nice and they have a lovely patio on which you can eat your eggs . 
2		this was tough to write . <sssss> we were big fans of joe 's , but recently returning to the valley and looking forward to it , would have to bow out next time . <sssss> we got pulled pork meat plate and pork with salad . <sssss> how do i put this ... the pork tasted like moth balls . <sssss> i know , ew . <sssss> could n't believe it . <sssss> we tried smothering it with bbq sauce and just could n't take it . <sssss> it used to be so good - what happened ?! <sssss> i understand the older crowd , we got there early around 4:30 pm , but it used to be a friendly atmosphere . <sssss> not sure what happened this time , but did n't feel the love in the food or the people . <sssss> would n't go back . <sssss> now joe 's bistro out there in agritopia ? <sssss> - much better ! <sssss> plus , their onion rings rock ! <sssss> ; - -rrb- 
2		oh munchies , i had such high hopes for you . <sssss> i mean , okay , i did n't expect the best food ever , just something to help with those late night gyro cravings . <sssss> and honestly ? <sssss> the gyro i got was okay . <sssss> in fact , what i had a problem with was n't the food or the customer service i got , but the mistreatment of one of my fellow customers that left a bad taste in my mouth -lrb- hypothetical bad taste , that is . <sssss> because . <sssss> okay . <sssss> i was eating a decent gyro . <sssss> it 's hard to truly have a bad taste in that situation -rrb- . <sssss> the other customer came in and from her place in line started demanding they switch out her philly for a chicken philly . <sssss> i will say , i would have totally understood if the guy behind the counter had chosen to refuse to serve her and just kicked her out due to her behavior , but that is n't what he did . <sssss> instead , he refused to remake her sandwich for free , despite the fact that the two sandwiches are the same price , and made her pay for a second one because he apparently made a mistake when she placed her original order . <sssss> i 'm sad to say that , due to counter guy 's behavior , i sincerely doubt i 'll ever be back . <sssss> meh late night food is one thing , but bad customer service definitely outranks late night , post drinking cravings . 
2		ate here at lunch today for the first time . <sssss> `` eh '' is all i can say . <sssss> i came in around 12:45 and even though no one was behind me in line the twerp at the counter made me feel very rushed . <sssss> i ordered a turkey tom . <sssss> this was basically a big white dried out sandwich roll with a couple of slices of turkey , a butt-load of shredded lettuce , a couple of sliced tomatoes and some mayo -lrb- i requested no sprouts which are normally also included -rrb- . <sssss> what is supposed to be gourmet about that ? <sssss> the sprouts ? <sssss> i also grabbed a chocolate chunk cookie . <sssss> not even worth eating the whole cookie . <sssss> really . <sssss> i see no reason to return and do n't understand how they can call themselves gourmet ... 
2		terrible , terrible experience that lasted hours and felt like a taste of hell . <sssss> service was dysfunctional and slow . <sssss> server made assumptions about timing that led to a disagreeable experience ; she also was n't wise to gluten free options . <sssss> food was ok . <sssss> the menu changes often , so i 'm not sure how my review would help . <sssss> the lobster , squash soup app was quite good . <sssss> the cheese plates are an outrageous rip-off . <sssss> i was n't a fan of my poached sausage entree ; which was an alternative pick as they ran out scallops , my first selection . <sssss> strange location in the woods . <sssss> lots of foul smell as you approach . <sssss> in the end : i would n't return , nor should you venture there . <sssss> the value was absent and i was annoyed as i left . 
2		chalk this one up to `` sh * t that was cooler when i was a kid . '' <sssss> i think it was cooler mainly because i still believed in santa claus or did n't wonder how and why stores would stock all the stuff they do and why american consumers feel so inclined to buy as much stuff as they do ... took the gf here this weekend and i was disappointed . <sssss> we had some good food but the overall old town experience was lacking even at the best of the galleries and sh * t shops . 
2		i really wanted to like this place to support local small businesses ... however , the food was not all that exciting . <sssss> the best part of the meal were the mini-muffins . <sssss> it went downhill after that . <sssss> i ordered the cajun eggs benedict . <sssss> the eggs were cooked nicely but the cajun sauce just did n't taste right . <sssss> when i was in nola the sauce had a much better flavor and depth . <sssss> this one missed the spot . <sssss> the kielbasa tasted more like hot dogs . <sssss> sad to say , if it were n't for the muffins , i would have only given 1 star . <sssss> the mini muffins are worth a trip but that 's it . 
2		was visiting this establishment often until our last visit on friday . <sssss> usually we 're here for there happy hour . <sssss> very small happy hour menu with the regular stuff , pizza , cesar salad , and artichoke dip . <sssss> they were understaffed and after having to wait 20 + mins just for the check . <sssss> well , never again . <sssss> cool spot , horrible service . 
2		i had a waffle cone with a scoop of peanut butter cup and a scoop of rocky road . <sssss> the ice cream was n't great ; the flavors seemed off , and the texture was grainy . <sssss> the cone was flavorless and fell apart before i finished the first scoop . <sssss> for the price , it did n't really seem worth it . 
2		unfortunately , i think this coffee shop relies on its `` artsy '' location for repeat business instead of actual customer service . <sssss> every time i have been here it is terribly long waits . <sssss> another inconvenience is they pretty much make their own hours , they do not keep the hours they post on their website . <sssss> i do n't see what the big deal is about conspire . 
2		because of the good yelp reviews , my wife and i decided to try this joint out . <sssss> it is just a whole in the wall . <sssss> there was no one else inside when we showed up around 7 15 on saturday night . <sssss> i ordered three tacos -- chicken , fish , and steak . <sssss> my wife ordered chicken enchiladas . <sssss> we got it to go and it was ready in about ten minutes . <sssss> we got home and were excited to try our food . <sssss> unfortunately everything was under par except the chips and salsa . <sssss> the chicken and steak were a little over cooked . <sssss> flavors ok , but nothing amazing . <sssss> enchiladas were just ok . <sssss> the beans tasted like they were from a can . <sssss> my tacos were a little bland . <sssss> really , nothing was great . <sssss> i really wanted this place to be great . <sssss> i 'm always rooting for little places like this ... but i cant tell people to go here over carolina 's . <sssss> cheap food and cheap taste . <sssss> maybe other items on the menu are good ... but i do n't think i 'll be going back to see . <sssss> good luck taqueria los angeles . 
2		horrible service . <sssss> i went at 1pm , and they were out of many flavors of bagels and were not willing to make more . <sssss> of course , they had plenty of the `` gourmet '' flavors that cost almost twice as much . <sssss> they had also clearly labeled their pastries , but unfortunately had done so with the wrong labels and prices and did n't seem to care that they were n't accurate . <sssss> the staff was rude and could n't have cared less about customer service . 
2		it has been a while since my previous visit to this place and the meal i had then was far from memorable . <sssss> today i decided to give it another try while my car was being serviced at the aaa service facility a block away . <sssss> i ordered the spicy bento to get a better sampling of things this restaurant offered . <sssss> the meal was a disappointment : the rice of the sushi had a watery texture , the spicy chicken and spicy beef were overly salty , and the vegetable curry was no more than a starchy gravy with some bits of overly mushy vegetables . <sssss> on the positive side , the place is bright and clean and the service is fast . <sssss> those are not enough to bring me back , though , since food is the main draw for me as far as dining establishments are concerned . 
2		ok , here 's the thing . <sssss> my florist should be the bomb . <sssss> it 's got the right location , the right crowd and the right vibe -lrb- especially when the pianist is on -rrb- . <sssss> the drink menu is inventive , though inconsistently priced , and makes good use of the building 's former incarnation with lots of floral inspired beverages . <sssss> my florist has been open for years , but it still feels like opening weekend . <sssss> confused host service at the door , no linens or silverware on the table , -lrb- our party was actually supplied paper towels that looked like they came straight out of the bathroom dispenser ! -rrb- <sssss> how especially unfortunate it was that they were so ill prepared on what could possibly be one of their biggest days of the year : the willo district home tour and valentine 's day . <sssss> our server had to apologize too many times for the shortcomings of the management , kitchen staff , bar , etc. . <sssss> as for the food , i had the turkey and brie , which was passable . <sssss> the cranberry relish had an unexpected kick , which i liked , but the pumpernickel bread was dry and hard . <sssss> in fact , `` too dry '' was a common complaint for more than one of my lunch companions , whether it be not enough salad dressing or a reuben sandwich that was not `` hot and juicy '' as requested . <sssss> -lrb- and really , who wants `` too dry '' on valentine 's day ? -rrb- <sssss> come on , guys , get it together . <sssss> this could be a great place with some attention to basics . 
2		looks like they re-arranged behind the bar . <sssss> now all of the bottles are compressed into one small section , and appear to be a little more full . <sssss> now , they other half is populated with many , many , many jars of peanuts . 
2		this place belongs in scottsdale where they are more concerned with appearances than substance . <sssss> the place looks cool but the two times i have been , the main courses have been over cooked and last night , it was over cooked and cold ! <sssss> funny thing was it came out before we had taken two bites of our appetizers . <sssss> my guess is the waiter screwed up the timing when he put the order in . <sssss> there are better places if you want to enjoy the food but few places better in town if you want to be seen . 
2		pretty good but could b better . 
2		i loved , loved , loved the fair when i was a child . <sssss> i loved it . <sssss> i got to see the beach boys in my first ever concert ... such good times . <sssss> i was so happy when we went . <sssss> i would go at least 3-4 times while it was in town . <sssss> well , i definitely do not love what the fair has become . <sssss> its a travesty , a sham , and ... well ... a mockery . <sssss> guys : its a travishamockery . <sssss> let me explain why ... now : ~ what to do ~ well , you will blow boatloads of cash . <sssss> . <sssss> that 's numero uno . <sssss> besides that , you can check out all the rides they offer , as well as exhibitions ranging from animals to crafts and baking , as well as the expo area , where retailers hawk their products . <sssss> oh and the food , its the one time of the year where most people wont judge you for eating your soul away . <sssss> ~ the good ~ eh ... there are some `` bright spots '' . <sssss> the food is fun and different . <sssss> i love the indian fry bread stations , although every single vendor is not the same ... you have to be picky . <sssss> the food options are abundant as well , and if you do not care about what you put in you , its a field day for you . <sssss> the expo they hold each year has some fun vendors each year . <sssss> in 2013 , they were n't as much fun as previous years , but still they held my attention for a bit . <sssss> i did try some of the extreme rides ... holy hell , scary , but fun . <sssss> i will admit i did enjoy hanging out with my fiance in cool weather , it was refreshing and relaxing to stroll around and have some fun . <sssss> also , the concerts and events they offer each year are pretty good for free admission , i simply have n't had the time or i would 've hit up a number of them over the years . <sssss> ~ the bad ~ oy vey ... so , lets say about 7 + years ago -lrb- approximately -rrb- the whole re-invention of fairs began nationwide . <sssss> with that change came increased prices , lower quality prizes , insanely fatty and poor quality foods , and whats worse : a really crummy corporate feel , by way of rcs out here in phoenix . <sssss> so now , we are left with what rcs has provided us . <sssss> its really a shell of former fun times . <sssss> we still have the awesome destruction derby and concerts , as well as some fun rides still . <sssss> . <sssss> but they have stripped all that away with the watered down prizes and games that are pretty much rigged ... and the prizes ... i mean , come on . <sssss> they deduce down to dog chew toys really . <sssss> perfect size for our yorkie and chihuahua . <sssss> rips in about 3 days time . <sssss> prices are outrageous and i am consistently keeping an eye on spending ... you are a fool to go to the fair and just spend whatever ... because you will spend 100 + easy with that mindset . <sssss> i see a number of people defending the current incarnation , and it amuses me . <sssss> i remember the balloon darts , when i could win a huge framed picture to hang up on my wall -lrb- i remember choosing a michael jordan picture -rrb- ... well , now , we have balloons , with hackisack-style balls filled with pellets . <sssss> the balloon dart signs , with pictures of darts are still out there !!!!! <sssss> ruining my childhood memories , that 's what rcs is doing . <sssss> and diets too , they just ruin so much...up-charge me at the gate , and get rid of rcs . <sssss> i do not care about spending more to get in , for a quality product . <sssss> getting in for free is not worth it . <sssss> just wretched . <sssss> i could go on and on . <sssss> . <sssss> deplorable . <sssss> ~ the down low ~ i really am not sure where to go from here . <sssss> really am not . <sssss> it 's a rubbish product , really . <sssss> its like paying for a jaguar , and getting an aveo ... its not right . <sssss> i am giving 2 stars , because it actually could get worse , and if it does , i have an option to downgrade . <sssss> i mentioned the redeeming factors already , which all make up the 2 stars they receive ... but they do not help . <sssss> not a bit . <sssss> i 'll spare writing further , and let the review speak for itself . <sssss> save the money and go up north and hike and get your palms read by a hippy ... or go golfing ... or go to castles and coasters and mess around with your family ... or go to scottsdale and steal someone 's audi ... or do a meth lab bust in aj . <sssss> all of these are equally invigorating and less expensive options , than spending $ 10 to throw a ball in a basket , attempting to win a cheap stuffed 1000 '' stuffed bear . 
2		cracker barrel is one of those places i have been eating at for many , many years , but unfortunately , i feel their quality is going down and their prices going up . <sssss> on our last visit , the service was as good as it gets - they get an a + on service . <sssss> i ordered the 4 vegetable plate and substituted 2 veggies for a baked potato and a dinner salad . <sssss> one of the veggies was green beans - the bowl was not heaped high like it used to be - i ate the entire contents with two bites . <sssss> the potato came with butter and a packet of sour cream - no bacon , no chives , no cheese - this was a big change from the past and i felt like i was totally ripped off . <sssss> wendy 's has a sour cream and baked potato for a buck . <sssss> the salad was small and had lettuce , tomato and that 's it . <sssss> no onion , etc or anything - plain . <sssss> my total bill for my plate was 12 dollars . <sssss> i wo n't be going back anytime soon , that 's for sure . 
2		old spaghetti factory : the place where fat suburbanites bring their fat children to eat fatty , salty and bland pasta . <sssss> the parking lot is a camry convention and the clientèle is as white as the bread that they serve with your meals . <sssss> on the plus side , kids love the trolley and they get to ring the bell when they finish eating . <sssss> always good motivation . 
2		i was disappointed . <sssss> i have not been to a sweet tomatoes restaurant for about 3-4 years due to their higher prices , but i went to join a friend for lunch on friday . <sssss> their pricing is still high -- about $ 12 for lunch and a standard drink . <sssss> the salad selection was sparse . <sssss> a few green salad types and additives . <sssss> dressings were thin and not very tasty . <sssss> toppings were sparse -- no cold cuts of chicken , pepperoni , nor any bacon crumbles . <sssss> and even the soups were not very hearty or tasty . <sssss> i remember them being better some years ago . <sssss> i think i will stick with the salad bars at soupersalad ! <sssss> , golden corral , or even sizzler 's . <sssss> better salads and better prices . 
2		i have been here 3 times in hopes of it being fantastic just one time . <sssss> but honestly it never has . <sssss> i tried 3 different steaks each time , their black tiger shrimp , their stuffed mushroom appetizer , their calamari , their goat cheese appetizer , and all were okay . <sssss> nothing to rave about . <sssss> the best items out of all those listed were perhaps the calamari and the goat cheese . <sssss> i have had way better steaks elsewhere . <sssss> not much flavor to them . <sssss> for the prices i expected more . <sssss> i probably wo n't be back . <sssss> service is great . <sssss> but if you are looking for an awesome , melt in your mouth steak , this is not the place . 
2		has is $ 3.11 here today . <sssss> not bad . <sssss> pretty decent price on gas for this quick being one block from the on and off ramp of the 101 there is a low 's , burgerking , $ .99 store and mcdonald 's and golds gym on the same road . 
2		i used to love this place but now service has gone down and the prices have risen . <sssss> it used to be nice to get a pedi and gel manicure and not spend all day there . <sssss> i did n't get my massage on my hands because she took too long trying to figure out how to shape my nails -lrb- that i ended up having to do myself -rrb- . <sssss> i am not planning on going back until it gets better . <sssss> bummer . 
2		it pains me to write a negative review of pj , but i just have to ... i was so excited for the new location to open because my husband and i go to the indian school location any time we 're down that way , and this is way closer to home . <sssss> we were impressed by all the room up there ! <sssss> not cramped like the other locations . <sssss> unfortunately , the food was not nearly as good ! <sssss> both of our meals were not nearly as good as we 've had before -lrb- at the other locations -rrb- . <sssss> also , our service was terrible . <sssss> we asked another server if ours was new , but nope : she 'd bee there since it opened a couple months ago . <sssss> she forgot jalapeno our hummus appetizer -lrb- to their credit , they brought it out after our meal and gave it to us for free , but it was bland and not that good -rrb- . <sssss> she charged me for a side of tahini , even though it was supposed to come with my veggie burger , and she never refilled our drinks . <sssss> overall , this was a very disappointing pj experience . <sssss> i 'll try again one more time , but if it does n't improve , i wo n't be going back to this north valley location . <sssss> : -lrb- 
2		they do have some good chicken fingers but other than that they are over-rated and over priced . <sssss> their lemonade is excellent but they charge for refills . <sssss> cane sauce was good . <sssss> overall , i will not be a repeat customer . 
2		we were driving around the summit and saw the diner . <sssss> thought we would give it a try . <sssss> when we walked in , no one smiled and said welcome or anything . <sssss> we sat at the bar . <sssss> the server came up , did n't introduce herself , and just said '' what do you want to drink '' , that was it . <sssss> we ordered food , which was good , a little pricey and the presentation was lacking . <sssss> it looked like the food was just thrown on the plate . <sssss> i will give it a second try to check out their breakfast , but if the service and presentation stay the same , we will probably not come back . <sssss> i hope the place heeds some advice from its customers . <sssss> it 's nice to have something local at the summit . 
2		gosh , where do i start ... went for breakfast yesterday and was excited to try brunchies as i had been hearing about it for years . <sssss> i love serrano 's so i figured that this place was going to be good as well . <sssss> not even close to being like serrano 's . <sssss> first off , you can definitely tell that brunchies takes a back seat to serrano 's in the owners eyes . <sssss> my first impression was not a good one based on the atmosphere and cleanliness of the restaurant and the service from the hostess . <sssss> we came in the back entrance and walked to the front . <sssss> the hostess was not very polite or friendly and seemed a bit slow . <sssss> i know that sounds mean but she acted like she really was not excited to be there . <sssss> i get it , a hostess job is not exactly exciting , however , she could have at least acted somewhat happy to seat us . <sssss> in any event , the booth she sat us at was filthy . <sssss> the table was clean but the seating had crap all over it and looked like it had n't been cleaned in god knows how long . <sssss> it especially grossed me out when i went to wipe the seat with my hand so i could scoot over and some of the gunk from the seat stuck to my hand . <sssss> eeeewwwwwweeeeeee . <sssss> not only that , the cups were dirty and old . <sssss> in fact , i know for a fact that they are the old cups from serrano 's . <sssss> how do i know ? <sssss> because i have eaten at serrano 's for a long time and i actually commented on how serrano 's needed new cups on one of their comment cards . <sssss> a week later , new cups at serrano 's which was great but now i know where the old ones went ! <sssss> anyways , on to the menu . <sssss> it was your typical greasy spoon diner breakfasts . <sssss> sometimes i do n't mind that but i have really been trying to watch what i eat lately so was hoping to get something with egg whites in it . <sssss> it did n't appear that was even an option on the menu . <sssss> in fact , there was n't a whole lot of anything healthy on their menu . <sssss> i opted for the veggie omelet on their special menu with home fries and wheat toast . <sssss> the hubby had their special of the day which was chicken fried steak with gravy , eggs , and a biscuit . <sssss> the portions were definitely large which also warranted the prices -lrb- the prices were good too -rrb- . <sssss> so this was a definite value for breakfast , however , the food was very mediocre . <sssss> both my husbands and my eggs were not seasoned whatsoever . <sssss> on the plus side , the hubby said that the biscuit definitely tasted home made . <sssss> a few other notes , i was especially disgusted when i saw one of the waiters -lrb- not ours thank god -rrb- picking his nose as he walked into the kitchen . <sssss> yuck . <sssss> lastly , the big creepy statue of the old man with a tray of candy needs to go . <sssss> halloween is over and wont be happening for awhile . <sssss> needless to say , this place a big let down and i am not very thrilled to go back again . <sssss> however , i most likely will have to go one more time because the hubby wants to try the hobo omelet . <sssss> : -lrb- 
2		products are good , but do not count on them for technical support . <sssss> their staff is either unknowlegable or just does not care about customer support . <sssss> my two order inquiries were answered quickly , but the both responses were akin to ` go away and do n't bother me . '' <sssss> i found another company that would support their products . 
2		i should really be writing a 5 star review . <sssss> i love the food , i love the atmosphere and it 's reasonably priced -lrb- for most things -rrb- . <sssss> but i 've several bad experiences here and have had to leave twice because the food took so long that i had to go to work . <sssss> and i 've arrived with ample time . <sssss> the first time i came in an hour before i had to be at a work meeting and ordered some breakfast . <sssss> the open faced breakfast sandwich is great and i do n't normally mind waiting the average 20 minutes to get my food . <sssss> but after sitting patiently on the patio for over 40 minute and my food did n't arrive i had to go inside . <sssss> i never got an answer as to what went wrong , but regardless my food was n't even started being made and so i demanded my money back and left hungry . <sssss> the manager apologized and told me to ask for him next time and he would help me out . <sssss> i do n't want hand outs , i just want my food when i order it . <sssss> but i gave them the benefit of the doubt . <sssss> i 've worked in restaurants and i know how things go . <sssss> several times after this incident -lrb- i end up here at least twice a week some times -rrb- i have had to wait unreasonable amounts of time to get food . <sssss> i 've ended up having to take it to go and eat at work a few times because it took so long . <sssss> i might understand this when it 's busy , but these are times when it 's slow . <sssss> i 've learned to not even try eating there if i have less than an hour to spend during lunch . <sssss> this morning was probably the final straw for me though . <sssss> i went in with 20 minutes until i had to be at work . <sssss> -lrb- my work is a 3 minute walk from this place so it 's extra convenient -rrb- there place was pretty empty with two people ordering and two people in front of my in line . <sssss> after waiting about 5 minutes or so to get up to the register i placed my order for the jacked up pb + j shake . <sssss> it 's pretty stellar . <sssss> but then i waited , and waited and waited . <sssss> i watched people who ordered after me get food and drinks . <sssss> before i knew it , it was after 10am and i was late for work . <sssss> looking in the kitchen i saw the cook starting what might have been my order , but i was already late by this point . <sssss> i did n't even have time to ask for a refund i just left . <sssss> i 'll eat the $ 6 -lrb- which is a little over priced anyway -rrb- as a reminder not go back to this place until they can figure out how to get food out in a timely manner . <sssss> it could just be me , but i thought 20 minutes to order a smoothie would be plenty of time . <sssss> apparently i was wrong . <sssss> i should have gone to starbucks . 
2		not sure what the hype is here . <sssss> small tvs and empty during the boston red sox world series game 5 -- and most of the tvs were on mnf !!! <sssss> so much for this being a true red sox bar ! <sssss> i just do n't understand what happened to this place ! ' 
2		reading the reviews , i was expecting a lot more . <sssss> simply put , this is one of those places that tries to be better than it is . <sssss> if you 're expecting a true `` public house '' with local or interesting beers , this restaurant has no different beers than dozens of other places . <sssss> so go someplace cheaper . <sssss> on the food front , everything was `` meh '' , suffering from the symptom of having too much going on . <sssss> the famous chopped salad was smoked salmon , arugula , israeli couscous , dried corn , tomatoes , and i ca n't remember what else . <sssss> it tasted like it sounds : a bunch of divergent stuff thrown together on a plate because those ingredients should be interesting together . <sssss> but they 're not . <sssss> i also had the roast pork sandwich . <sssss> i ca n't quite tell you what it tasted like . <sssss> but , the menu said it was `` fennel roasted pork sirloin , rapini , scamorza cheese , serbian lepinja roll , pickled vegetables . '' <sssss> i do n't even know what half of those things are , so it must be interesting , right ? <sssss> meh , not so much . <sssss> but , everyone else seems to like it , including the arizona republic , so what do i know ? 
2		i do n't care for this place all that much . <sssss> but my friends do , and i can see how uneducated normal folk get sucked into the `` cheesecake factory vortex of doom '' . <sssss> i came here for a get together with friends the other night . <sssss> the menus are a bit much with all that advertisements in them . <sssss> the menu is eclectic , but i definitely think the prices are borderline gouging . <sssss> the portions are big , that is correct . <sssss> but , chicken is cheap , and a plate of it with mash and gravy for $ 16 is a bit much . <sssss> the cheesecakes are delicious , all though we were a bit bummed to find out that the cheesecake is not made in house . <sssss> my friends first choice was said to be unavailable because it was frozen . <sssss> that means the place is not a cheesecake factory , but merely a cheesecake depot , where the real factory trucks in the baked goodies . <sssss> i strongly feel this place is way overpriced for what it offered . <sssss> it is a casual , family restaurant with upscale dining prices . <sssss> if they had a better product , i could stand spending $ 60 for 2 , but not when it 's a sandwich and chicken and biscuits . 
2		it 's funny what a difference a couple years , and some positive buzz , can make . <sssss> this place has gone from a quiet little neighborhood haunt to a hangout for jersey shore rejects looking for a fight to a trendy hotspot - all while remaining essentially the same . <sssss> nothing extraordinary in the way of decor , selection or service - but popular , so if that 's your thing enjoy it while you can - who knows what it will be in another year . 
2		very bland , poor tasting pizza ! <sssss> does not live up to the hype !!!! <sssss> this was the first and probably last visit to nellos . <sssss> this pizza does not live up to all the hype here on yelp . <sssss> i ordered a pizza with black olives and beef . <sssss> i had the `` original '' crust . <sssss> the crust was thick , chewy and tasteless . <sssss> it looked as thought it was put on a conveyer oven , not woodfired . <sssss> after the second slice the crust became too hard , bland and chewy to even eat , like cardboard . <sssss> it was a very bad product . <sssss> the sauce was very bland , and it looked very much like a frozen pizza , except some frozen pizzas are better . <sssss> i really do n't understand the pizza market in phoenix . <sssss> i grew up in on authentic italian pizza and cuisine , albeit here in phoenix everyone seems to sing high praises to very bad pizzas . <sssss> this pizza does not even compare to a good pizza . <sssss> i just think that the folks here in phoenix have n't tasted a real pizza , if they travel back east and try the pizza then they would know what real pizza pie is supposed to taste like . <sssss> for now if i want a good pizza pie , i 'll just have to make it my self . <sssss> i would not recommend this place to anyone . <sssss> one star for the food , one star for the service -lrb- service was good , pizza bad -rrb- 
2		had dinner here the other night for my birthday . <sssss> i 've been to teppanyaki restaurants before and have had a good time as the chef always told jokes while he was cooking and really kept us entertained throwing stuff up in the air . <sssss> so we decided to try benihana 's . <sssss> unfortunately , i think maybe our chef was new as he really just concentrated on his cooking and did n't tell a single joke . <sssss> his `` performance '' was boring , i think he only got 2 shrimp tails in his hat ! <sssss> the food was very pricey , but the shrimp was tasty . <sssss> you need to eat as you go otherwise the food gets cold . <sssss> they brought the rice too early and it sat there getting cold while the chef was cooking the meats . <sssss> they need little rice pots with a lid instead of the bowls . <sssss> they also kept pushing the birthday club and the manager even came around and handed each of us a form to fill out . <sssss> this just was n't the experience i was hoping for . 
2		i was only impressed with the seviche -lrb- hope i spelled that right -rrb- . <sssss> other than that the place is more about the atmosphere than they are the food . <sssss> the fish tacos were dry and lacking flavor . 
2		mcdonalds is obviously the most generic hamburger place . <sssss> it is also the most succesfull despite being one of the worst . <sssss> outside of the beloved french fries , what does good ole mcds have going for it ? <sssss> carls jr beat their $ 1 drink with one for 69 cents . <sssss> the new wings are horrible . <sssss> yes they are bigger then the kind you get elsewhere , but not the right kind of spicy and too expensive . <sssss> the `` special sauce '' always brings down the burgers which arent that good to begin with . <sssss> now that mcdonalds is planning on eliminating the dollar menu and replacing it with a $ 5 menu , maybe its time to try the sonic up the street . 
2		i 'm shocked by the good reviews this place has . <sssss> their burger has to be one of the worst ones i 've ever had . <sssss> it literally had no flavor ! <sssss> i had a bbq bacon burger with grilled onions , bacon , cheese , lettuce , tomato and mayo but none of the flavors stood out and all i could taste was the bun . <sssss> it was so bland . <sssss> also , there were way too many people working . <sssss> i think i counted 6 people yet it still took a good 15 mins to prep my to-go order of 2 burgers , fries and onion rings . <sssss> i feel like it was a waste of $ 15 . <sssss> the only reason i gave them 2 stars is because everyone working was friendly and their fries and onion rings were decent . <sssss> i do n't know if i went on an off night or what but i 'm seriously shocked people like this place . <sssss> soooo many better burger joints around . 
2		i really hate to give bad reviews on anything ... but , ra deserves it . <sssss> i mean , i went there once . <sssss> it was dim , too loud , and waaaay too crowded for my tastes . <sssss> they had some interesting sushi items up at the bar -lrb- the sushi bar was pretty decent -rrb- , but the chef delightfully forgets to tell you what a sushi is if you ask -lrb- i ended up ordering a salmon roe roll ... i almost threw up -rrb- . <sssss> plus , the waiters and waitresses could be better and a little more attentive . <sssss> all in all , if you want some all right food in a pinch , then ra is okay . <sssss> otherwise ... i would n't dare venture in there again to order food . 
2		i went there for my 30th birthday celebration . <sssss> we were greeted immediately by a friendly staff member and taken to a table that was not set up for the number of guests we had even though we had called ahead several days prior for a reservation . <sssss> we were given 2 dinner menus for 5 people . <sssss> we asked about happy hour menu and he brought back one menu and was n't able to answer questions about it . <sssss> he took the appetizer order from 3 people and left the table without taking order from the other two . <sssss> he didnt return till the appetizers came out from the original order . <sssss> the apps were fantastic ! <sssss> -lrb- stuffed shrimp , shrimp cocktail and salmon -rrb- . <sssss> we asked about the price fixed menu for $ 60 and he didnt really know much about it . <sssss> we ordered out entrees and they arrived rather quickly . <sssss> the entrees where very bland and lacked flavor and substance . <sssss> i have had way better food at olive garden , which is really sad for the price of the food . <sssss> very disappointed . 
2		i recently had a work event scheduled at the embassy suites on 44th street , and unfortunately i was not 100 % pleased with the experience . <sssss> i first of all will say that the hotel itself is very nice , pretty , nice courtyard in the center , and the event room was set up well and clean . <sssss> however the service was lacking quite a bit . <sssss> first , when i got there i was the first to arrive out of my group , my event coordinator did n't get in that early and was not there to greet me or show me around , nor did anyone else bother to show me to the event room or how to get where i was going . <sssss> i take that back , the girl at the front desk handed me a map and pointed me in a somewhat vague direction that did n't help much . <sssss> i was told i would have easy access to the room to unload my car at , well without any employees to show me the access door i had to hoof my boxes from the parking lot around the building the long way . <sssss> i did not find that back door until long after the seminar started . <sssss> the room we were scheduled in was changed last minute for some reason , i believe it has something to do with the final head count that we gave them . <sssss> the room we ultimately in was a bit cramped for the number of attendees we had . <sssss> i had to introduce myself to the catering manager and chef . <sssss> no one came in to remove the places and trash from breakfast until almost 11 a.m. nor did they check on us . <sssss> the boxed lunches were n't made right , only upsetting a few clients , but still ... i had to pop into the kitchen myself a few times and track someone down to help me . <sssss> with the amount of money we were paying , it should have been perfect . <sssss> for a cheap continental breakfast and a mediocor box lunch it was about $ 40 per head , kind of a lot . <sssss> over all my seminar went well at the hotel , but there were some behind the scenes issues that i really wish i did not have to deal with throughout the day . <sssss> i would n't not recommend this hotel for you event , just make sure to cover everything prior to your event . <sssss> such as on sight contact , exactly how the food will be prepared , appropriate signage and whatnot . <sssss> ** i have not spend a night at this hotel so this review should not reflect on making overnight reservations . 
2		we went on new years day and it was probably the worst day to go for brunch . <sssss> everyone and their mommas were there and it took them forever to seat 10 people , get our orders and give us our food which , by the way , they messed up so many times i almost wanted to just get out of there . <sssss> our waiter said he told the chefs the correct orders but they still managed to mess it up ... whatever . <sssss> it was a zoo in that restaurant . 
2		arrived and was told it was a hour wait . <sssss> fine . <sssss> after 1 hour and 45 i started inquiring more on how much longer it would take . <sssss> was told `` cleaning table now '' . <sssss> another 30 min passed and i was finally seated . <sssss> over two hour wait after told an hour . <sssss> :-lrb- pizza was weak ! <sssss> super dry and very little cheese . <sssss> salads were good though . <sssss> not up to oregano standards . <sssss> wo n't be back to this location . 
2		quite possibly the worst airport food i have ever had in my life . <sssss> ok , i 'm probably spoiled as i usually travel out of sfo , or get the opportunity to have bomb asian airport food in taipei , etc. . <sssss> i had four choices at my gate area . <sssss> a brewery , a starbucks , a mini to go deli , or this piece of sh * t. i opted for this piece of sh * t because i had a two hour layover -lrb- turned into six hours -rrb- out of las vegas and needed actual fatty food to soak up the copious amounts of alcohol my liver endured . <sssss> also , they seemed to have the shortest line . <sssss> `` i 'll get chili cheese fries and a bacon cheeseburger , '' i thought to myself . <sssss> the girl at the register was relatively sweet -lrb- as she called me `` sweetie '' -rrb- , so that 's why they get a +1 star from me . <sssss> just for you , babe . <sssss> i think my wait was over ten minutes . <sssss> and for what ? <sssss> a cheeseburger that had plastic meat and cardboard bread ? <sssss> mediocre fries with taco bell chili and no cheese ?!! <sssss> i did n't even realize there was no cheese until i posted a picture of my food on instagram and my friend asked me where is the cheese ? <sssss> there was no cheese on my burger as well . <sssss> do n't call yourself a cheeseburger if there 's no cheese . <sssss> you are actually a hamburger . <sssss> at least my diet coke was consistent . 
2		service is usually slow and the food is meh . 
2		expected an amazing experience ... was a bit let down . <sssss> sushi was ok - but not creative at all . <sssss> was trying not to compare , but the sushi at virago in nashville is leaps and bounds better -lrb- try the ecuador roll ! -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> server was pushy and annoying . <sssss> was glad to get out of there and get to the `` living room '' at our hotel - the w scottsdale where sushi roku resides . <sssss> tip : if you stay at the w you get a card for a free `` appetizer tasting '' at sushi roku . <sssss> this ended up being just an amuse from the chef that they `` took off the bill '' because of the card we received - and after lots of questions about what we liked and did n't like - 2 meatballs came out as the amuse . <sssss> that is not an appetizer tasting experience - it was an amuse - which in nashville means super cool thing a chef makes that is free and makes you happy . <sssss> not the same at sushi roku . <sssss> left me disappointed . 
2		i 'm typically a fan of rubio 's . <sssss> i 've been to many of their locations . <sssss> however , this one disappointed . <sssss> i ordered : steak burrito especial , $ 6.99 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rubios-fresh-mexican-grill-phoenix-5?select=zozrhgzhjp_mipyqg2kn6a#zozrhgzhjp_mipyqg2kn6a steak street taco , $ 1.89 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rubios-fresh-mexican-grill-phoenix-5?select=4kj_ntl5g2exkqica2zeha#4kj_ntl5g2exkqica2zeha the food came out in a short time . <sssss> while i was waiting , i went to the salsa bar to grab a few cups of their spicy salsa . <sssss> the first item i ate was the steak street taco ... the meat was dry and guacamole was bland . <sssss> i poured a lot of the salsa on it to add flavor and give it some moisture . <sssss> very disappointing . <sssss> next , i had the burrito . <sssss> that was dry too ! <sssss> even with the sour cream in the burrito , it was dry ... the steak , rice , beans ... all was dry . <sssss> needless to say , i used a heavy dose of salso on that as well . <sssss> to make it worse , the chips that came with the burrito were 1/2 fresh & crispy and 1/2 were covered in oil or stale ... so they were chewy ... that means they combined new , fresh chips with a batch of old ones ... bummer . <sssss> one positive thing is that the service here was outstanding . <sssss> the cashier was very friendly and had a nice , welcoming smile . <sssss> i also watched a customer complain that one of the sodas was out of syrup on the machine ... the employee sincerely apologized and quickly remedied the situation by replacing the empty container with a new one . <sssss> i 'll have to come back and give this place another try , it may have been an off day for them . <sssss> return factor - 60 % 
2		mediocrity , thy name is gordon . <sssss> came here on friend 's recommendation to enjoy the outdoor patio and presumably from the name , large amount of fine beers . <sssss> the patio was ok , but that was about the highlight . <sssss> i found the beer menu surprisingly limited and uninspired . <sssss> my friend and i were both disappointed with our -lrb- $ 28 ! -rrb- <sssss> steaks . <sssss> our waiter was moody and uninformed . <sssss> when we asked for beer and food recommendations his reply was : `` well , i like it all . '' <sssss> thanks , buddy . 
2		oh , the good times that used to abound here ! <sssss> this used to be a great spot to see some tempe locals that wanted to slum it from casey 's or just wanted cheap , strong drinks and some good tunes on the jukebox . <sssss> at it 's height of trendiness , you could barely move or order a drink at 1 a.m. on the weekend , but it 's popularity has waned severely in the past two years . <sssss> it 's a great escape from the college scene , with a couple of pool tables and pbr in a can is the drink of choice type of atmosphere . <sssss> i miss when it was fun to go here , not cool . <sssss> p.s. it 's also the type of bar that opens at 6 a.m. , so if you 're still awake and partying , hitup this joint . 
2		ordered burger `` med . <sssss> well '' for take out even had the girl repeat back my order & made sure it will be med . <sssss> well only slightly pink she said . <sssss> well when i got home with it ... it was pretty much rare to medium rare !!! <sssss> will not be ordering food there anymore . <sssss> too many other places that will get your order correct . <sssss> the chips were good though . <sssss> the order was ready on time . 
2		reallllyyy salty food.i mean i love salty food but this is beyond ! <sssss> me and my fiance both had a stomach ache couple hour after eating there.should of give a one star but only good thing bout this place is the service . <sssss> not going back there again or any red lobster ! 
2		it 's time to update my review and give it a more fair assessment . <sssss> i 've been a member for almost a year now , and this gym just is n't the same . <sssss> before i continue , i am going to say that i cancelled my membership last night . <sssss> i had a brief conversation with stan w. on sunday about gyms , and it got me thinking about my choice in facilities . <sssss> i started thinking about la fitness in a more critical light . <sssss> the equipment is all the same , but is n't maintained the way it should be . <sssss> when a machine needs to be repaired , it may take two-to-three weeks . <sssss> this has become such an overcrowded gym . <sssss> during peak hours , and even on weekends , i 've found myself waiting for benches , cardio machines , cable machines and such for upwards of 15-20 minutes . <sssss> people do n't re-rack their weights here , both on the bars , and with the dumbbells . <sssss> it 's like the idiot meathead convention all showed up to this particular location . <sssss> you 'd think the staff would take care of this , but no . <sssss> they are too busy selling memberships and keeping this place overcrowded . <sssss> the overcrowding has taken it 's toll on the locker rooms too . <sssss> the men 's room used to be pristine , and regularly cleaned . <sssss> this is no longer the case . <sssss> it 's now a cess pool , and smells like a horrible burrito incident . <sssss> stay away . <sssss> pray to the good lord that you do n't need to take a leak after you work out . <sssss> parking at this gym ? <sssss> a joke . <sssss> it 's next to impossible if you go after work . <sssss> i 've spent several minutes of my life circling the lot , looking for a spot . <sssss> now , you are thinking ... dave , why are you being a dick right now ? <sssss> why so negz ? <sssss> well ... if you want to know the positives of this gym , try the spin class at 6:45 on thursdays . <sssss> fred is the instructor . <sssss> you ca n't miss him . <sssss> he has a mustache . <sssss> he is awesome . <sssss> his music is great ! <sssss> not really sure what is the deal with the juice bar . <sssss> i never saw it open , but a couple days back , i saw a sign that said `` business opportunity '' . <sssss> guess it 's for sale . <sssss> classy . <sssss> if you are still reading this , you are either bored at work , interested in what i have to say , or making a decision on a gym . <sssss> choose wisely . <sssss> i cancelled my membership last night . <sssss> i chose a smaller , local business . <sssss> afterall , i 'm a yelper . <sssss> an elite . <sssss> local business is where i prefer to spend my money . <sssss> this place is a chain , and you feel it when you walk in ... and not in the good way . 
2		carolinas , your enchiladas ruined it for me . <sssss> i ca n't imagine eating another one of your soggy tortillas swamped in a pool of the most horrifying enchilada sauce my taste buds have ever met . <sssss> mole overload and non-existent chile . <sssss> lacking any real taste to it whatsoever . <sssss> disappointed . 
2		wish i would 've read the reviews before eating here , red robin would 've been a better option . <sssss> had calamari as an appetizer , was really disappointed that it ha no flavor at all , did n't like the white sauce that came with it and marinara really did n't taste like much either . <sssss> ordered a california burger for dinner and that too was totally bland , i never salt my food even when cooking but had to add some to my burger bc the only flavor i could taste was the char from the grill , the few fries i did eat were actually pretty good and the best part of the meal . <sssss> service was n't too bad , but no one cared to clear the table , also our waitress was n't too responsive to checking on us or even when i told her about the calamari . <sssss> as soon as we walked out i had severe abdominal pain and felt like i was going to vomit in the parking lot , thankfully i live close by and was able to make it home before anything happening . <sssss> needless to say , i wo n't be dining at gordon biersch again . 
2		i 'm going to have to grab a tweed sports coat and an elvis wig from the goodwill before i go back to shady 's . <sssss> my `` modern '' style of dress does n't seem to be accepted among this `` non-judgemental '' group of individuals . <sssss> i 've been there 2-3 times and i always feel like i came from the future and the locals can not believe what they are seeing . <sssss> more then once i have felt like blood was about to pour from the ceiling and i was going to be swarmed by a secret society of hipster vampires as i played a game of pool on their table . <sssss> the inside is very small and cluttered with far too much furniture . <sssss> the front patio is too cramped and is in serious need of expansion . <sssss> alas , they make excellent drinks , and a relative works there , so i gave it two stars . 
2		i probably wo n't go back . <sssss> our server was awful . <sssss> my food was okay but the gal i was with had to send back her order twice because the cook could n't stick to the menu item -lrb- one of the wraps -rrb- . <sssss> after the second time going back to the kitchen we decided we would just get mine to go and leave , so my friend could get lunch at work . <sssss> the server then billed us for her food -lrb- unreal ! -rrb- <sssss> and would n't let me talk to the manager after i asked twice . <sssss> luckily , the manager ended up coming over because she had to approve taking my friend 's meal off the bill . <sssss> she apologized profusely after we explained the situation and comped the entire bill . <sssss> that made it right . <sssss> she also gave us two $ 5 chips to use should we go back . <sssss> i 'm not sure i will but i have to say the manager saved the day and this review from being a complete bust . 
2		two words `` tourist trap '' . <sssss> if you 've ever been to old tuscon , walls drug or the big texan then you have experienced this kind of place . <sssss> i guest if you are in town you have to do it once . <sssss> the food was not good . <sssss> my party had steaks and they were overpriced and not that good . <sssss> we all had stomach aches afterwards . <sssss> i was initially kind of suprised when the waiter told us they had there own micro-brewery . <sssss> my enthusiasm waned when i asked what styles of beers they brewed . <sssss> he said `` we have a brown one , amber one , black one and hefeweizen '' . <sssss> can you believe that ? <sssss> oh yeah do n't wear tie they have decorated the ceiling with ties they have cut off of people . 
2		i was sadly disappointed , after reading all the excellent i thought it was shoe in . <sssss> not so much . <sssss> long wait for food then it was just ok . <sssss> id rather pay more for food that tastes amazing and does n't take forever to get . 
2		over 150 reviews for you to read about this mediocre steakhouse . <sssss> i ordered the st. louis pork ribs which were very tender but slathered in a cloyingly sweet bbq sauce . <sssss> the corn on the cob was more like creamed corn on the cob , been in hot water a long long time ! <sssss> their cowboy beans were average at best , my wife had the all white meat fried chicken , fairly good and lots of it -lrb- 3 breasts with the bone deep fried -rrb- but we had to ask for some gravy twice and then received half a shot glass of tasteless milk and flour white gravy , enough to sparely cover one breast . <sssss> the salad needed more dressing but was refreshing . <sssss> best part of the meal was the indian fry bread . <sssss> the green beans were semi cooked and unseasoned . <sssss> the place was extremely noisy and on top of that a band played in the background . <sssss> i left with a headache and a resolve to never return for a $ 40 + meal . 
2		not impressed . <sssss> food was ok , server was average . <sssss> i guess i just expected more for the price . <sssss> most items $ 20 + . <sssss> i eat out 2-3 times per week and will pass by here next time . <sssss> i 'd say its worth driving a few miles to desert ridge and eat at bj 's if you want a brewery type restaurant . 
2		urgency and customer service is not one of their strong points at this location in the afternoon . <sssss> waiting in line while someone was figuring out what to order . <sssss> one gal at the cash register and 3 baristas just talking while there was a line . <sssss> it 's kind of annoying when you see employees just standing around talking while customers are waiting . <sssss> they could have opened the other cash register or started making the drinks for the others in line that knew what they wanted ; just like they do in other starbucks . <sssss> i will say i 've been to this location a few times before and have had great service . <sssss> the gal working the register was very kind and said thanks for waiting . <sssss> if you 're looking to get a quick drink in the afternoon , try a drive thru location . 
2		i love pane bianco -- but sadly they have priced me out of their market for the most part when it comes to sandwiches . <sssss> $ 13 for their tuna sandwich is outrageous -- and beyond a price point that i am willing to pay under any circumstances . <sssss> at 9 or even 10 i thought it was reasonably fair and allowed for a tip -- at $ 13 it is not affordable and there is nothing left over for a tip . <sssss> i am so sorry that i wo n't be having lunch there anymore with any kind of frequency . 
2		in a two day span , i frequented this monument to lard , not once , but twice ; making federico 's my defunct dinner for two days in a row . <sssss> how did this happen ? <sssss> why did this happen ? <sssss> these were questions i woefully pondered as i spent nearly 3/4 of a sunday perched upon the porcelain throne , evacuating my bowels like anderson cooper and his news crew amidst a chaotic tahrir square . <sssss> the only reason to my madness , that i could fathom , in the clouded and reeking haze i was brewing that sabbath day , was that i had literally drank or smoked myself retarded - so much so that my ravenous appetite overwhelmed my better judgement . <sssss> friday night , my mistake was assuming that the graveyard shift would care enough to properly cook an adobada burrito at 2 am . <sssss> it honestly tasted like they doused some chorizo in red chili sauce wrapped it in a tortilla and threw it out the delivery window like an unwanted baby in bath water . <sssss> saturday night for one idiot reason or another i ordered a green chili burrito , which i 'd assumed would be hard to fuck up , apparently not . <sssss> this didnt taste like green chili pork , perhaps it 'd be more apt to label it as `` boiled pork offal with a splash of tomatillo salsa '' it was proabably the worst green chili i 've had in a long while . <sssss> sunday , montezuma claimed his bloody revenge on this descendant of spanish immigrants -lrb- had this angry aztec spirit bothered to scan my family lineage on ancestry.com he 'd have realized that the spanish on my mothers side is hardly large enough to exact vengeance for atrocities committed by cortez and his cronies in the 16th century , but who am i to question undead central american monarchs -rrb- ahem . <sssss> lets just say i dont enjoy prolonged bathroom visits and this is what federico 's translates to in my vernacular . 
2		i 'm sorry kitchen 56 - i 'm not in love . <sssss> i went here a couple of weeks ago with friends for dinner . <sssss> the service was fine , the atmosphere nice but the food was just ... ok . <sssss> i had one of the pizzas and a salad . <sssss> my friends both seemed to enjoy their meals but no rave reviews . <sssss> i had the same feeling that i had a beckett 's table - lots of hype but it missed the mark for me . 
2		boy , was i disappointed ! <sssss> ... the rooms are small and claustrophobic . <sssss> . <sssss> and the check-in did not tell me about a pool party that day which was so loud that i could not relax . <sssss> . <sssss> i also could not use the hot tub because of it ... drunk kids were cursing and screaming in front of my door at 2 am ... i left more stressed than when i came ! <sssss> i would never stay there again , , , the room , the bathroom , the upkeep , the environment . <sssss> . <sssss> all made for a really bad stay ... 
2		so we come to sushi room often and have always enjoyed ourselves . <sssss> i definitely echo the majority of the reviews stating that prices are high and service is slow . <sssss> this has never been a huge concern as my gf and i time our visits around their specials -lrb- which are awesome -rrb- . <sssss> monday nights are half price roll nights and i would highly recommend visiting on mondays . <sssss> the truffled steak roll , as well as the primo are worth the money . <sssss> the reason for my review , and for the two stars is due to a rather unremarkable experience tonight . <sssss> so my gf and i planned our trip tonight to get the half priced rolls special . <sssss> we also had a groupon for $ 30 . <sssss> we understood that we would not be able to spend this 30 dollars on specials or happy hour . <sssss> . <sssss> as is the case with most groupons . <sssss> so prior to placing our order we explained to the server that the 30 dollar groupon can be applied to the $ 40 dollars worth of normally priced items on our order and the other $ 30 dollars in rolls will be at half price . <sssss> the server was befuddled and explained that they ca n't do that , i asked to speak to the manager who was equally befuddled . <sssss> i explained that we have followed the directions on the groupon , and we 're now entitled to the same specials as all the other patrons were . <sssss> he broke down the expense of providing groupon deals , and implied i ca n't get that kind of a deal and also get half priced rolls . <sssss> i asked him if we could get half priced rolls if we paid for our first order with our groupon , paid our check , then left , came back through the front door and started a new order for half priced rolls , he said no ! <sssss> i begged him to accept my business , to which he said it was too expensive . <sssss> it was one of the strangest experiences i have ever had in a restaurant . 
2		great service and nice ambiance , but the food does n't hold up . <sssss> i started with the spinach , apple and gorgonzola salad , which comes with chicken , and none of the flavors worked right . <sssss> the nicest thing i could say about the salad was that the spinach was n't wilty at all . <sssss> next , we had ordered the four-cheese pasta which features broccoli and chicken , and it fell flat . <sssss> the rich white sauce lacked flavor , and the broccoli looked good but tasted odd . <sssss> the chicken was completely different from the chicken on the salad - in a good way , but it was still kind of odd . <sssss> i could see myself coming back here just for the convenience factor , but it wo n't be with any anticipation for good food , unfortunately . 
2		just had lunch here . <sssss> the friendly staff is the only reason they get two stars . <sssss> ordered baby back ribs ... . <sssss> weak looking and tasted baked not slowly smoked for hours . <sssss> where is the pink smoke ring ???? <sssss> felt as if they had been sitting around since last night . <sssss> no moisture left in them at all . <sssss> my collegue had the `` smoked '' chicken and was similar in that it tasted baked and was dry as a bone . <sssss> the staff talked us into the `` homemade '' pecan pie which tasted and looked like it was right out of quick trip . <sssss> wont be back ... $ 37 for lunch for two and i could not have been more dissatisfied . 
2		ehhh ... it was ok . <sssss> quesadilla was ok ... . <sssss> carne asada burrito my daughter had was down right aweful . <sssss> queso dip was good . <sssss> i doubt i 'll be back . <sssss> great service tho , very attentive and polite waitress . 
2		the spicy garlic wings are the only reason i gave this place 2 stars . <sssss> the service is terrible !!! <sssss> i have been here several times over the last couple of months and every time it is the same thing . <sssss> i have to wait on the servers for 15-20 minutes to place my order and even then i have to flag them down . <sssss> the majority of people there do n't even look happy to work there . <sssss> if you 're not then do n't ! <sssss> the drinks are terrible too , stick with beer . 
2		ok food-clean 
2		too bad the food was amazing , because the kitchen focused on getting 1 party 's food out , 6 other tables had to wait for their food more than 45 minutes . 
2		i have a long love-hate , divorced , remarried , divorced relationship with christopher 's . <sssss> perhaps it is my overall disgust with the french offerings of late and their seeming laziness of effort in technique , but christopher 's just does n't cut it anymore . <sssss> paola was always too aggressive on her wine list . <sssss> impressive to look at , but a disappointment to order from ... sorry , do n't have that ... sorry , do n't have that either . <sssss> it was always something you just had to get used to , mildly expressing your disappointment and frustration with your server ; they 'll never get it . <sssss> recently , they 've been able to get a super discount on salt . <sssss> they use it liberally on everything . <sssss> my last two visits have been such . <sssss> i have such respect for christopher and his team , the first time i just grinned and bore it . <sssss> but this last time , i did send my main course back . <sssss> what happened to the godly veal reduction ? <sssss> it tastes manufactured ... does shamrock even do a veal stock ? <sssss> i shudder to think . <sssss> -lrb- i flee any building with marks of shamrock foods . -rrb- <sssss> my favorites have been the pastry of snails -lrb- escargot -rrb- , the filet of beef , the mushroom soup , the onion soup , the sautee d'fois gras , the pear salad , and of course the cheese plate . <sssss> oh , i almost forgot , the decadent osso bucco and accompanying pile of pasta . <sssss> i miss the days when christopher served a set of 10 tables on the other side of 24th street . <sssss> sure , the cd of chopin nocturnes played the same track over and over , but the fois gras was to die for and the bordeaux i had my heart set on was immediately available . <sssss> what is happening to fine dining in this town ? <sssss> where else can i go ? <sssss> please . <sssss> please ! <sssss> tell me . 
2		update : the owner/manager of the clarendon responded to my yelp review . <sssss> he is offering to refund a night of our stay , given some of the concerns i listed here . <sssss> i applaud this manager for addressing my concerns . <sssss> he has also agreed to work more closely with staff to improve training and to improve the overall hotel experience for guests . <sssss> it seems he really wants his hotel to be a top-rate boutique in phoenix , and he has the right attitude . <sssss> there 's certainly some work to be done , but i have to give him credit -lrb- and the hotel 1 more star -rrb- for making the effort . <sssss> ********************** i traveled to phoenix with my bf for a long weekend , hoping for a bit of relaxation and the chance for a little adventure . <sssss> we were looking forward to some warmth , a soak in the hot tub , a comfy room , and a little adventure on camelback . <sssss> unfortunately , we chose the wrong part of town to stay in -lrb- it was rather boring over there -rrb- , and the wrong hotel . <sssss> the clarendon is , in theory , a cool boutique hotel . <sssss> but the details are sorely lacking . <sssss> the room we got was nice enough , but there were issues . <sssss> check it out : 1 . <sssss> the light over the bathroom sink was out . <sssss> when i told the front desk , they said they 'd have it replaced . <sssss> it never happend , in our 3 nights there . <sssss> 2 . <sssss> the coffee maker in the room would not work when plugged into the power strip on the counter . <sssss> we had to set it up on a chair , next to another outlet . <sssss> 3 . <sssss> the housekeeper did not close our room door completely after cleaning , so it was opened when we returned . <sssss> we did not have the confidence to have them clean it after that . <sssss> 4 . <sssss> we ordered 2 glasses of wine from room service , to be delivered to us at the hot tub , a mere 50 yards from the bar . <sssss> after more than 20 minutes , we had to go and inquire about it . <sssss> and they never came back out to see if we wanted anything else . <sssss> we were in there for at least an hour . <sssss> 5 . <sssss> on our 2nd night at the clarendon , we woke up at 2am to incessant knocking next door . <sssss> this was the start of a 3-hour lovers spat , which was played out with lots of shouting , screaming and crying . <sssss> the drama started outside the room next to ours , continued inside the room for an hour , then some slamming doors , yelling out the door , and continued in the parking lot , which our bedroom window faced . <sssss> after 3 hours , we finally called the front desk to diffuse the situation . <sssss> 3 hours . <sssss> 6 . <sssss> after the drama , it seemed that someone next door , or maybe upstairs , had the tv on all night , at a volume high enough to come through the wall into our room . <sssss> we finally had to turn on the bathroom fan to create white noise to drown it out . <sssss> 7 . <sssss> the hotel 's wifi connection did not fully work in our room . <sssss> we could get 1 computer online , but it was really slow . <sssss> the other computer would not recognize the signal . <sssss> it was fine if we were down in the lobby or restaurant though . <sssss> 8 . <sssss> the gym is worse than dumpy , 2 tiny rooms crammed with equipment . <sssss> what a waste . <sssss> the bed was comfortable , and they provide l'occitane products , and all the basics are in the room . <sssss> pool and hot tub were nice . <sssss> but there are so many little things they can do to improve the experience at this hotel . 
2		the restaurant itself is a generic , sterile looking hole in the wall . <sssss> clean and the staff is friendly . <sssss> full belly `` used to have '' one of the best french dips in the area ... my how the mighty have fallen . <sssss> i am a sucker for a good french dip and full belly `` used to be '' be 5 stars . <sssss> their french dip used to consist of a fresh bun , a generous pile of real unprocessed sliced roast beef and a pretty good au jus . <sssss> they changed . <sssss> for the worse . <sssss> the french dip may still be on a fresh bun . <sssss> but the lighter softer cheaper flavorless roll . <sssss> the kind that falls apart when dipped in the au jus and no flavor . <sssss> they also switched to a tasteless , processed style of roast beef that makes the fast food chain that starts with `` ar '' and ends with `` by 's '' taste like prime rib at morton 's steakhouse . <sssss> the au jus may have been a generic beef broth poured out of a can with no seasoning . <sssss> to be fair , i have had other items and they were all good in the past , but i am fearful the other menu items have suffered the same fate and am not going to spend my money to find out when there are too many other options in the area ... the place that starts with `` ar '' and ends with `` by 's '' is just down the street . 
2		i used to love going here , but recently every time i call the phone has been disconnected . 
2		meh . <sssss> maybe it was just that we decided to dine in 10 minutes prior to closing , but i was definitely not impressed . <sssss> i had not been here in ages . <sssss> probably 10 years , maybe 15 . <sssss> no exaggeration . <sssss> i remember nothing but good things about miracle mile . <sssss> i remember being excited to come eat here . <sssss> so one night while shopping at arrowhead with a friend , i got a sudden craving for a pastrami sandwich with coleslaw and thousand island dressing . <sssss> i was very excited to walk in and find that it was on the menu ! <sssss> i did n't have to special order it ! <sssss> it was a good size sandwich . <sssss> big enough that when cut in half , you still have to use both hands . <sssss> i took my first bite and was immediately disappointed . <sssss> not that it was bad . <sssss> it 's just that i had fond memories of this place and i was really expecting something near the level of perfection of the # 19 at langer 's in downtown l.a. ... or at the least like gandolfo 's in tempe . <sssss> nope . <sssss> it was nowhere near as good as either restaurant . <sssss> it was just okay . <sssss> the bread had a slight toughness like it was day old bread . <sssss> the meat was chewy and lacking flavor . <sssss> the coleslaw was really good and had the perfect crunch . <sssss> the flavor of the coleslaw was not strong , but still masked the flavor of the pastrami . <sssss> i will stick with jason 's or heidi 's next time i have a hankerin ' for another deli style sandwich . 
2		it seems interesting to me that this place has gotten some really good reviews . <sssss> i guess neither i nor my husband `` get it . '' <sssss> my husband and i visited this place shortly after it opened . <sssss> so , maybe it had made some changes ? <sssss> we had the carnita 's burrito . <sssss> in my opinion , it was not that great and totally overpriced for what you get . <sssss> the carnitas was dry and there was an odd sweetness , perhaps a sweet salsa , in the filling . <sssss> i am a salty , savory , spicy person . <sssss> i do n't like my burritos to be sweet . <sssss> i do n't think i would visit this place again . <sssss> i am just not into it . <sssss> for some reason it is difficult to find a good mexican restaurant in tempe . <sssss> i really do n't understand why . <sssss> my go to is restaurant mexico or chipotle for something quick and cheap in the tempe area . 
2		we were excited to try this new restaurant . <sssss> we went in on a friday night right at 7 o'clock and the place was packed ! <sssss> it had live music and a great mexican theme . <sssss> we thought we are in for something really good . <sssss> unfortunately after ordering it took a full hour for us to get our appetizer . <sssss> we were starving by that point . <sssss> when the meal came it was less than impressive . <sssss> our total bill for two meals one salad appetizer and one beer was over $ 50 ! <sssss> i can say with certainty that i would n't have paid $ 25 for that meal and that i would much rather go to even a local mexican chain over this place ! 
2		jumped on the groupon offered last week for my arepa . <sssss> i had very high hopes . <sssss> tried the grilled meat medley -lrb- $ 14 -rrb- . <sssss> there was this gristly carne asada thing in there , along with a small link of chorizo , and a blood sausage . <sssss> none of these sausages were sufficient in size , and neither was the wad of hyde they tried to pass off as `` steak '' . <sssss> there was also a few lumps of fried yucca . <sssss> those were alright . <sssss> also ordered a few arepas -lrb- $ 4-6 each -rrb- . <sssss> they were the size of a mcdonald 's cheeseburger . <sssss> . <sssss> the corn bread the meat sat on was omg so dry and stale , and the filling inside -lrb- meat + gouda -rrb- was greasy , bland , and gloppy . <sssss> this is some really overpriced , sad food . <sssss> no me gusta ! 
2		we have been going here for several years and every time the only thing consistent is the rude staff behind the front desk . <sssss> my grandson was visiting from cali for spring break and wanted to go bowling yesterday . <sssss> i am on their email list and had received a coupon for two hours of bowling with shoes , food , etc for $ 7.99 . <sssss> i asked for the special rate and was very rudely told that it does n't apply during spring break and that lanes were $ 3 + and shoes were $ 4.50 . <sssss> when i asked about who has spring break now he rudely replied paradise valley schools . <sssss> really ???? <sssss> this was scottsdale , wtf ? <sssss> so i paid over $ 30 for three of us to bowl . <sssss> when i asked for two lanes -lrb- one w / bumper for grandson -rrb- he acted really put out . <sssss> we had a good time , but both my daughter and myself have our own shoes and i felt ripped off and hate rude workers , so i was mad . <sssss> then afterwords we went to the game part of the place and almost every game was broken or did not give out tickets . <sssss> my grandson wanted to play ski ball he loves and they were broken too . <sssss> of course the desk people could care less . <sssss> we will not be going back here again . <sssss> too many times they have treated us like crap and i would much rather take my money somewhere else where i am appreciated and provides even some sort of customer service . 
2		so i 've only been living in north scottsdale since november on the * other * side of scottsdale rd. for most of my life . <sssss> getting fed up with my nails chipping after a few days of being painted i recently decided i would start getting regular manicures so my nails always looked superb . <sssss> i live at thompson peak pkwy and flw so i have plenty of nail salons to choose from but on saturday picked paulene 's nails because it was on my way to running errands . <sssss> i got in and was seated right away . <sssss> for the most part , my experience was n't half bad until the nail tech asked me if i was pregnant -lrb- either for lack of conversation or just to be rude because i have never been asked this in my life -rrb- to which i just kind of got a sour experience from there on out . <sssss> she criticized my choice in color -lrb- black on valentine 's day -rrb- and was asking questions about my boyfriend and i that were frankly none of her business . <sssss> she was chattier than any other tech i 've ever had . <sssss> she ended up slightly injuring one of my nails from filing them down or perhaps cleaning them . <sssss> it 's just a small cut that has practically healed but not something i should be receiving when i get my nails done . <sssss> a simple manicure cost $ 15 -lrb- not terrible -rrb- but they wanted $ 38 for a mani and a pedi which is way too much in my opinion . <sssss> needless to say i will be looking elsewhere for my manicure next time . 
2		good lord . <sssss> i do n't ask for much . <sssss> i ordered a slice of quiche and an iced coffee . <sssss> they did n't have to bake the quiche , just warm it up . <sssss> i waited 15 minutes and then went to the counter to ask for it . <sssss> the server looked confused and the guy who took my order said he `` got lost . '' <sssss> i heard the server apologize to at least three tables -lrb- but not to me -rrb- . <sssss> she told one guy the toaster burned his cinnamon raisin bagel -lrb- the last one in the shop -rrb- and insisted repeatedly that she did n't burn it -- it was the toaster 's fault . <sssss> quiche was tasty , though . <sssss> the server said it was mushroom and spinach , so i had to wonder for a minute what the bright red things in my quiche were ... then , i figured out it was mushroom and chard . <sssss> coffee was `` eh . '' <sssss> the floor looked dirty . <sssss> there was a paper towel in the toilet . <sssss> ok , i 'm nit-picking now . <sssss> the place was moderately busy ; the small private parking lot was full . <sssss> fortunately , i was on my scooter , so i could squeeze into a non-parking space easily . 
2		ladies and drag queens beware , the `` sandbar '' actually has sand outside . <sssss> not very friendly to those trying to impress in heels . <sssss> i work very close to the sandbar on friday nights after work alot -lrb- 10-15 -rrb- of people from my work go there . <sssss> i have been there quite a few times but not somewhere i would encourage someone to go . <sssss> i have had some of the food , minichimis are ok , tasty when you are drunk but it 's no substitute for jack in the box tacos at 2 in the morning . <sssss> there are a lot of great options for happy hour this just ins ' t one of them . 
2		mediocre , overpriced food and a terrible wait for two containers of pre-made sushi and a salad , to go . <sssss> oh , and tip jars at the registers . <sssss> tips jars for what exactly ? <sssss> it 's fast food . <sssss> on the plus side , if you do n't count the well-worn signage , and the old faded décor it is very clean . <sssss> i almost forgot , for sheer entertainment purposes , make sure to check out the misspelled sign in the ladies room ! <sssss> -lrb- sorry guys , you are out of luck on this one ! -rrb- 
2		i have been very disappointed in avanti 's lately . <sssss> i used to love it . <sssss> a friend and i each got groupons to go so i thought great ca n't beat half off . <sssss> i had n't eaten here in years . <sssss> nothing has changed it 's dark and outdated . <sssss> they need a ramsey make over for sure . <sssss> the service was good although it was very difficult to understand our waiter he had an extremely thick accent . <sssss> the caesar salad was very good . <sssss> the veal parm which is my favorite of all time was not good . <sssss> the veal was rubbery and the breading soggy . <sssss> the pasta was way overcooked although the sauce was good . <sssss> the tiramisu was soggy as well . <sssss> the cake at the bottom was soaking wet . <sssss> yuck if not for the groupon i would have sent this back . <sssss> but half off an overpriced meal made me think i got what i paid for . <sssss> well we had another groupon to use so we went back . <sssss> the second time the service and atmosphere the same . <sssss> me thinks there is a microwave doing heavy duty in the back . <sssss> this time i had seafood risotto bluck ! <sssss> the risotto was undercooked and had no flavor . <sssss> the seafood tasted dirty and there was grit in my shrimp . <sssss> this risotto was a disaster ! <sssss> my friends vegetables were mush . <sssss> it was worse than the first visit . <sssss> the worst part of both visits is that the restaurant was almost empty on a sunday evening and the food was sub par it makes no sense to me . <sssss> the long and the short of it i wont be back . <sssss> avanti 's has slipped to olive garden level with macaroni grill prices ! <sssss> way over priced . 
2		first and foremost andreoli 's is an overpriced italian grocery store . <sssss> as it is a grocery store , visitors should not expect table cloths or good service , many of the unusual items it carries can be found for less at nearby ajs , but not the broad selection of cheeses or salumi . <sssss> the homemade hot lunches can be very good , but this is not the place to bring the boss . <sssss> because the food is homemade , it varies in consistency from day to day . <sssss> i will say , as one who lived in italy for many years , the dishes are indeed authentic and worth a try , if not worth the price . <sssss> one warning : do n't order the pizza and expect an ordinary pizza . <sssss> it 's a rustic pizza , made with bread dough . <sssss> we did not like it . <sssss> andreoli himself , incidentally , can be quite grumpy to those he does not know . 
2		this place gets a big meh ! <sssss> from me . <sssss> i was attracted to the extensive beer list and then saw a local dines deal for it , so my husband and i decided to try it . <sssss> i love blanche beer in europe and saw that they had it on the menu here , it was pretty bland . <sssss> we started with an order of the crab dip , in the description it stated it had bacon and corn in it . <sssss> it tasted like crab salad , basically crab and mayonnaise and was served with triscuits , we did not taste or see any bacon or corn in it , it was a small serving too , definitely not worth the $ 9 . <sssss> we also ordered the eggplant sandwich and crispy potatoes . <sssss> the eggplant sandwich was okay , the goat cheese and pickled onions had good flavor , but you could n't really tell there was eggplant on it , the bread was nothing great either , basic supermarket french bread . <sssss> the crispy potatoes had good flavor , but they were drowning in oil , super greasy and our stomachs did n't appreciate it after eating these . <sssss> the best part of the meal were the complimentary cheese biscuits , those were pretty good . <sssss> the service was also good , but the food just did n't hold up . <sssss> i would not return here again . 
2		i have never eaten here before and i do n't think i will ever come back . <sssss> i arrived around 5:30 pm with my parents , my son , and my niece . <sssss> chompie 's has a patio so we asked to sit outside . <sssss> there were other people sitting outside as well . <sssss> the hostess said , `` let me check to see if someone will serve you out there . '' <sssss> from my experience working at restaurants with patios , if someone wants to sit outside , you seat them outside . <sssss> anyways , she came back and said , `` oh the patio is closed now . '' <sssss> since when do restaurants close the patio especially on a beautiful day like yesterday ? <sssss> i wanted to complain , but just shrugged it off . <sssss> the menu is very large , but nothing looked very appetizing to me . <sssss> i ordered the caesar salad and baked potato soup . <sssss> the soup was okay , but the salad was not very good . <sssss> it was mostly iceberg lettuce and did not have much taste at all . <sssss> not impressed at all . 
2		stopped in for a quick lunch but it ended up taking about a half an hour to get a hot dog & fries . <sssss> the dog was good , the fries just ok . <sssss> the place was small , but clean , the menu is just burgers , dogs , a couple mexican dishes and a bunch of different iced teas . <sssss> the service was gruff , maybe even rude . <sssss> i might stop by and try again , if i have time to kill but probably would n't recommend them . 
2		ok it 's official . <sssss> i do n't like the cheesecake factory . <sssss> i 've tried it a few times , and i 'm not a chain snob . <sssss> bring me some bertucci 's and i 'm happy . <sssss> but here ? <sssss> no . <sssss> just no . <sssss> i do n't get it . <sssss> the food is utterly mediocre -lrb- i suppose what does one expect , from a * factory * -rrb- , and personally i find the portions an affront to good taste . <sssss> they are disgusting ! <sssss> it 's like a trough . <sssss> anyone who can eat a whole plate of their food in one sitting needs to get help . <sssss> it 's also waaaay overpriced . <sssss> i guess you 're paying for quantity , not quality ? <sssss> i mean you get enough food to feed yourself for a week . <sssss> the decor is so confused and charmless . <sssss> i feel like i 'm on an acid trip when i 'm in there -- an acid trip that 's gone very , very wrong and you 've forgotten that life is n't a lewis carroll-ian hellscape . <sssss> one extra star for good service and good cheesecake . <sssss> but overall i can definitively say i wo n't be back to this particularly wretched chain . 
2		i toyed with the idea of 3 stars here , because the service was attentive , the cocktails were good , and the food was at least passable . <sssss> but not much more than that . <sssss> what got me a bit perturbed was that the whole attitude here reeks of some giant corporate machine -lrb- and how are we doing today , sir ? <sssss> and how are we enjoying our meal sir ? -rrb- <sssss> everything was very expensive , too , and that knocks them down another notch . <sssss> a group of 6 of us arrived during happy hour , and had a wait of 20 minutes . <sssss> not bad , and they were true to their word . <sssss> we bellied up to the bar and were informed that drinks were $ 5 -lrb- or was it $ 7 -rrb- but only well drinks were that price . <sssss> four martinis cost over $ 40 . <sssss> now i 'm prepared to pay that in a big city , but this is suburban chandler . <sssss> and it was happy hour ! <sssss> who drinks a vodka martini in a supposedly nice restaurant with well vodka ? <sssss> arrghhh , i am ranting now . <sssss> i had a salad and a steak . <sssss> the steak was a little overdone but tasty . <sssss> but then again , you ca n't screw up a ribeye too badly . <sssss> nor a salad . <sssss> i ca n't even remember my side , i think it was mashed potatoes , and they tasted like , well , plain mashed potatoes . <sssss> great decor , but i wo n't be back to see it again . 
2		- wannabe in-n-out - my burger was dry , and not very tasty . <sssss> i ca n't figure out why this place was so packed . <sssss> the next time i feel like dropping 8 bones on a burger , i will go to delux . <sssss> mmmmmm . <sssss> . <sssss> delux . 
2		was connecting through phx on 3/8 and had the blue corn chicken tacos . <sssss> the chicken had the consistency and taste of an old leather shoe with the price of new nike 's . <sssss> would not recommend , but was the only choice at the time . 
2		i ca n't believe the bf & i wasted 30 minutes of our time at this place waiting for our cold cut ham , turkey & provolone on sourdough & pastrami on wheat roll sandwiches . <sssss> there were only a handful of people ordering at the time & in the store . <sssss> i 'm assuming they were short handed that day , or had to fly all the way out to italy to get our frickin ' sandwich fixings . <sssss> the sandwiches were mediocre at it 's best . <sssss> the sandwiches tasted bland and cold cuts were dry . <sssss> the crapeteria here at my work makes better sandwiches than this place . <sssss> i guess the saying , `` you get what you paid for '' is definitely true here & for a 1/2 sandwich at $ 4.25 , i should n't have expected too much , especially when i 've been accustomed to some awesome sandwiches from genova 's delicatessen & specialty 's cafe & bakery . <sssss> one good thing about this place was the guy behind the ordering counter . <sssss> he was friendly , upbeat & extremely helpful . <sssss> would i revisit this place next time i visit scottsdale ... ummm ... no thank you ! 
2		always packed ! <sssss> the atmosphere is always better than the coffee or the service but i just ca n't stay away . 
2		no , i do n't want to take the bus to get to the train . <sssss> in my opinion , they did n't go far enough for people who live in phoenix . <sssss> it may be a good solution for tempe and mesa residents commuting to phoenix , but it is n't effective for phoenicians who want to get from the north valley into cenpho . 
2		we dined here this evening with my daugher 's dance studio being located in the same plaza . <sssss> we were both super excited to get a greek place nearby and had waited anxiously since we saw the signage up prior to opening . <sssss> it was pretty disappointing , i am sad to say :-lrb- we had to wait about 5 minutes at the counter to place our order and finally , i think one of the owners , came over to assist us in our order . <sssss> we waited almost 40 minutes for one gyro plate and one souvlaki plate although they did bring out soup samples to all the tables which was very thoughtful . <sssss> the gyro was nothing to write home about , the meat on the top of the pita was very very crispy , crunchy in fact which oddly enough , added a pleasant texture . <sssss> the sauce was standard and was just the right amount . <sssss> the rice was a standout ... super fluffy but in need of a little more seasoning . <sssss> my husband 's souvlaki pita was tasty , the meat was lean , moist and cut in perfect sizes for the wrap . <sssss> fries were standard with a slight sprinkle of parmesan and parsley . <sssss> deco was a little weird ... ... . <sssss> a map of manzanillo mexico in a greek place was a little weird not to mention the asian/chinese art on the tables . <sssss> television was quite loud and obtrusive , maybe a little mood music would be a better choice at night . <sssss> the service was really slow , they have been open a couple weeks now so maybe they are still getting the feel for the layout . <sssss> it was super clean , a positive for me :-rrb- i may go back in at lunch time perhaps to try out another dish . <sssss> i am really hopeful that they are able to maintain and stay open as every other establishment in this corner has closed previously . 
2		my review can be summed as : i did n't love it . <sssss> to put in another way : this joint is perfectly mediocre . <sssss> mediocre service , mediocre menu , mediocre food . <sssss> i wo n't and do n't go back -lrb- even when there 's a wait next door at sakana sushi -rrb- . <sssss> i had the rustica -- basically a giant , extra doughy , over-priced slice of pie . <sssss> did not love . <sssss> my friend had an unmemorable pasta dish . 
2		after telling lisa i had been to 3 gaps looking for a sweater and coming here to get it , i asked her if she had an additional sweatshirt in a medium . <sssss> in which she replied after helping a phone customer . <sssss> yes we have a medium . <sssss> ok i say . <sssss> i did n't see one there . <sssss> well its probably sold . <sssss> hmmm wha ? <sssss> after using my gap sense from being a frequent shopper i looked for the proverbial mannequin wearing a medium . <sssss> there it is i say to another sales associate . <sssss> can i get that one ? <sssss> sure . <sssss> thanks . <sssss> lisa needs more gap sense . <sssss> and better customer service skills . 
2		ok if you like a place to take the kids to have a party or play games this is the place for you . <sssss> not as great as a chucky cheese but big enough to host a party of kids . <sssss> the pizza was mediocre at best . <sssss> and really the salad came in a pre portioned bowl like fast food . <sssss> quite a disappointment really . <sssss> first time there and probably the last unless we take kids with us . <sssss> it was edible and proably up to par for children but just not that great reaslly 
2		we went in for the sunday brunch and ended up ordering off the regular menu because it did not have a lot to choose from . <sssss> the kids menu looked good but my daughter ate most of our pizza . <sssss> the tea was watered down and the lemonade was way to sour to drink . <sssss> it was okay but nothing special . 
2		first of all let me say the place is clean and the staff is very nice . <sssss> my wife and i both joined a year ago and signed up our daughter as well . <sssss> i thought it was weird that they took out 3 separate payments each month instead of one payment for the 3 of us but now i understand why . <sssss> my wife and i have n't used our membership for months so we went in to close it out and found out there is a $ 25 fee for canceling the membership , and it is not just one fee , it is $ 25 per person . <sssss> so i had to pay $ 50 to cancel a membership that neither my wife or i have used for months . <sssss> i am very upset . <sssss> if you read many review sites you will see i will be re-posting this everywhere . 
2		i am no longer a fan of the yard . <sssss> the valet parking is a major issue , it fills up and then you have to park across the street and play frogger trying top make it back across 7th st. the drinks are overpriced as is the food and the place is always filled with kids . <sssss> i do n't go to outdoor patio bars to have screaming children running at my feet . <sssss> i love children , and if i was going to peter piper i would expect the raucous . <sssss> unfortunately this has prevented me from being able to take advantage of the fun games they offer -lrb- ping pong , corn hole and shuffleboard -rrb- . <sssss> perhaps i go to early but any later and you are waiting 2 hours for a table . <sssss> no thanks . <sssss> -lrb- but yes i will probably still go there because i can ride my bike when the weather is nice and sit out on the patio -rrb- . 
2		i mispronouced something on the menu and i got an entire lecture about it complete with the mocking laugh . <sssss> sad cause i could have actually liked this place . <sssss> word of advice : get rid of all the gimicky advertisements including the sign for the casino . <sssss> make it into a french cafe not a billboard in times square . 
2		paid $ 150 for a one-time clean up . <sssss> they spent about 30 minutes here , just weed-whacked down everything and then blew it onto the sidewalk . <sssss> i 'll have to go out and sweep the dust off the sidewalks . <sssss> there are even still weeds in the cracks of my driveway and front porch . <sssss> wish i had given the money to a neighborhood kid , they would have done the same thing . 
2		this is truly sad ... because it was a nice apartment before this all happen . <sssss> i never had a problem here . <sssss> at all . <sssss> if anything broke frank came ... and we never hassled him too much because things rarely broke . <sssss> i had a parking situation with another tenant but that 's another story . <sssss> the parking spaces are very close so it can be a problem if people do n't know how to park . <sssss> the problem came in when my apartment flooded ... because the apartment above me flooded . <sssss> she has about 2-3 inches of water and right before i went to bed one night it started ... my smoke detector kept going off , and it was super annoying so i told my bf to take it down and we can call frank in the morning . <sssss> as soon as he took it down water started to come through it ... that was already a huge sign and i no longer felt comfortable sleeping that night ... but i was still going to try because i had to work the next morning . <sssss> soon after others started going off around the house and actually started to leak ... i then called the hotline to get frank out because something was seriously wrong and i did n't feel safe . <sssss> no one would answer the hotline , i got nervous because by this time my whole apartment was leaking through whatever it could get through everything except my room and bathroom was leaking . <sssss> it was so bad that bubbles started forming in my walls ... anyway i called the fire department and they saw it said there was nothing they could do but we should try to call the hotline like we did n't do that before ... the went upstairs to check the apartment above because we all figured it was something upstairs . <sssss> they banged on the door and she came to the door , apparently she was sleeping but her living room was a mess ! <sssss> the fire department told me it was n't safe to stay in my apartment that night . <sssss> i knew by this time i was n't going to get any sleep nor work tomorrow . <sssss> frank finally came with some big vaccum and basically tried to blame her for the problem and vaccumed her apartment . <sssss> i asked him to call the manager joyce and he basically would n't ! <sssss> we then decided that we will stay at a hotel until tomorrow which is what we did . <sssss> the next day she basically tried to refuse to give me another apartment saying that we needed to wait til ours was fixed again , but we went back before we talked to her and it was horrible the smell was bad and i started reading reviews online saying that the whole complex has leakage problems ! <sssss> i even read deeper and it just turned into a nightmare . <sssss> i had to threaten to call the state before she gave me a new apartment . <sssss> and get this it 's smaller ! <sssss> but i still paid the same rent ! <sssss> she made me sign another lease for my last month and that was that . <sssss> i was never late with rent , always kept to myself no problems and this is what i get . <sssss> i would advise against this apartment but if it 's last resort make sure you have renters insurance and that you understand your apartment may flood . 
2		what 's the least you can spend for the most food at phx ? <sssss> i do n't know , that 's why i 'm asking . <sssss> but i do know that it 's not at oaxaca . <sssss> my choices were slim and fattening . <sssss> i almost just got cold stone for breakfast . <sssss> there was a pizza place that was serving up wretched piles of eggs and ghastly meat type things . <sssss> a nice green chili burrito sounded just right for 9am . <sssss> http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/v44bpucu4vm4amd0_2k1qq?select=qmsidowwkwnmgmbtdize-w $ 5.95 after tax , that 's what i got . <sssss> pretty small , very greasy and somehow simultaneously watery . <sssss> only saving grace was that the side of salsa was very spicy . <sssss> next time i fly , i 'm just going to bring some power bars and eat cardboard . 
2		not sure why i went outta my way for this place . <sssss> seemed good when we first walked in . <sssss> then the mashed potatoes were cold and the meat was n't that great . <sssss> the sweet tea and the corn bread were great but that was about it . <sssss> i would n't go back . <sssss> best bbq in the west my ass . 
2		this place is not that great . <sssss> shogun express has way better chicken teriyaki rice bowls and beyond . <sssss> the chicken is what really bothered me here . <sssss> it was really tough and extremely chewy . <sssss> and that was the white meat . <sssss> they 're bowls are around 5 bucks which i like , but they 're not even filled to the top . <sssss> all in all i came here because shogun was closed and there are n't any other rice bowl places in scottsdale that i know of . <sssss> eh . 
2		very good small plates , but i got the sense this place will probably not make it . <sssss> why ? <sssss> the plates are extremely small . <sssss> we were three and sharing small plates should n't be this tiny . <sssss> some dishes are more focused on presentation than quality . <sssss> server tried too hard and seemed fake . <sssss> do n't think i 'd go back for the $ $ / quality . <sssss> . <sssss> very disappointing considering this is the same guy who started roaring fork ! 
2		this place has a pretty extensive menu for just $ 4.99 however , i ordered the kung pao chicken and it was sooo flavorless ! <sssss> the egg roll was way greasy and the fried rice was kind of hard . <sssss> i wo n't be back and that 's for sure . 
2		conflicted on this review but i am going to stick to my guns . <sssss> i am a huge fan of papago beers and love that they have 25-30 on top plus 7682763 beers -lrb- not actual number -rrb- in bottles that you can drink there or take home . <sssss> it is extremely loud inside which some nights can be tolerable but if you get a table of guys shouting at each other it can be distracting if you are looking to hang with friends . <sssss> my meh review comes from the food . <sssss> their menu has a lot of variety and everyone loves pizza right ? <sssss> i ordered the pretzel which itself was amazing , just the right amount of chewy and fluffy . <sssss> the cheese sauce it came with did nothing for the dish . <sssss> i also ordered the california blt salad and here is where more disappointment came in . <sssss> i ordered the 1/2 size which was a huge portion but it really did disappoint . <sssss> the avocado slices on the salad were not ripe and were rock hard . <sssss> the diced chicken was so bland and dry it tasted like it had been boiled . <sssss> the worst part was the bacon . <sssss> it was clearly the kind of pre-cooked , thin sliced bacon you can buy in the store . <sssss> the whole thing was pretty half assed with ingredients that are n't that difficult to make . <sssss> over all i wanted to give 5 stars but the place gets 5 stars for beer , 3 for ambiance because of how loud it gets and a solid 1 on the food . <sssss> i know it is a brewery and i should expect much in regards to food but come on , it 's not that hard . 
2		service is friendly and fast . <sssss> i was in and out of there in less than 10 minutes even after being 4th in line to order . <sssss> it 's very clean . <sssss> but my sandwich was just ok . <sssss> hard to eat . <sssss> lettuce and onions are oddly chopped together in chunks that keep falling out of the sandwich . <sssss> the wheat roll was hard and chewy . <sssss> if you are going to make a great sandwich , you need fresh bread . <sssss> it 's kind of a no-brainer . <sssss> the fact that someone else pointed out the stale wheat bread in a review from 3 years ago makes it pretty clear that they do n't really strive for greatness . <sssss> also bring cash . <sssss> there is a 35 cent additional fee for cards . 
2		love the decor - they 've done a great job ... too bad the food does not have equal appeal . <sssss> tried a number of appetizers and there was not a single one that stood out ! <sssss> very large bar - personal bartenders , but if they get busy , not sure they will be prepared . <sssss> also runners who bring the food out to the bar , never know where they are going with it . <sssss> need to work on a better system . 
2		love the dance floor at rockin rodeo . <sssss> hate , hate , hate that they turn the music up so loud that it makes is sound horrible -lrb- even live bands -rrb- and you ca n't talk to the people you are with at all . <sssss> i had to quit going there because i like to socialize when i go out with friends and drink & dance . <sssss> it just got to be no fun there , always got a headache from screaming . <sssss> too bad too , and management does n't care . 
2		i really wanted to like this place , i had bookmarked it a while back and when the dinner opportunity came up i was super stoked . <sssss> it 's not too far from my house , and the prices did n't look to bad . <sssss> plus , they had a happy hour . <sssss> score ! <sssss> when we got there , it was n't too busy , which is good . <sssss> there must 've been a memo i did n't get about screaming children though . <sssss> i 'm all for family restaurants , but this restaurant is actually pretty tiny , and the tables are smooshed together . <sssss> we had the lucky opportunity to sit next to the loudest of the kids , so the first half of our visit was not great . <sssss> our waitress , that 's another review all on its own . <sssss> i do n't know why , but i have an issue with restaurant dress codes . <sssss> i do n't need to see a girl wearing shorts so short that the bottom of her bum is sticking out . <sssss> this was pretty much all of the female staff . <sssss> she greeted us right away , which was good , but then it took about 10 minutes for ice water ... then she only took one alcohol order . <sssss> i had said i was n't sure what i wanted , but she did n't come back for another fifteen or so minutes . <sssss> that was annoying . <sssss> she was pretty absent from then on . <sssss> refills were sporadic , so we had to hold on to what we had . <sssss> not sure when the next refill would come . <sssss> when we finally got to ordering -lrb- i 'll admit it took us awhile because we are pretty chatty -rrb- i was famished . <sssss> i ordered mac n cheese -lrb- duh -rrb- and everyone else ordered a burger . <sssss> the mac n cheese i ordered had broccoli and chicken in it , my favorite combination . <sssss> however , when the mean came out , for some reason there was no chicken in it ... and the cheese had hardened on the top , which makes me think it had been sitting for a while before being brought out . <sssss> the waitress noticed i had no chicken , so she brought me out a piece on grilled chicken on a side plate . <sssss> this was the tiniest , thinnest , piece of ` chicken ' i 've ever seen . <sssss> the food was tasty however , so no complaints -lrb- minus no chicken and cold mac n cheese -rrb- . <sssss> all in all , probably would come again , but not for beer , it was very expensive , -lrb- between 4 of us , we had bout 12 beers and it was $ 90 during happy hour ? -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> i also would probably not recommend it unless you are prepared for the unwatched screaming children and over priced beer . 
2		what a cluster this airport is ! <sssss> it is dark and drab and the people who work here are not very friendly -lrb- unlike they claim to be -rrb- . <sssss> my boyfriend and i recently had a layover here . <sssss> when we arrived , we were informed that our flight would have am hour and a half delay . <sssss> we were ok with this as it gave us time to get a bite to eat . <sssss> 20 min before our flight was supposed to leave , they made an announcment that our gate was changed to the opposite side of the airport ! <sssss> as we speed walked our way with the rest of the passengers on our 100 % full flight , we realized that they changed two more flights to the section we were going to . <sssss> once we arrived , they announced that a flight was changed back to the original gate . <sssss> the announcement was so unclear that many people on our flight started heading back when the airport personel finally clarified that it was one of the other flights that changed back . <sssss> these people need to get it together . 
2		why do you bring in the best bands and then torture me ? <sssss> parking is freaking ridiculous , at least i have been enough times to know to leave my car on mill and walk . <sssss> your security people are a bunch of freaking jerks who take their power wayyyy to seriously - take off my shoes ? <sssss> what kind of weapon or drugs can i be hiding in my open toed 2 inch heels ? <sssss> your sound sucks - seriously sucks . <sssss> for all the fees you charge on top of tickets - buy some new speakers already . <sssss> the bathrooms are gross drinks are reasonable so you get 2 stars -lrb- watch out for the glass walls leading to the patio if you have overindulged in booze . <sssss> . <sssss> i 've heard they are easy to run in to -rrb- . 
2		the only reason why i 'm giving them 2 stars was because i liked my waiter . <sssss> we have been waiting to visit this restaurant for a month now . <sssss> my husband , me and my brother in law all went to try it . <sssss> we have read all the reviews online and decided that we wanted to try the sunday special fixed dinner . <sssss> we came in super excited to try the four course dinner , australlia month , and even decided to order a $ 75 bottle of wine . <sssss> which by the way , i got this bottle at the keg for $ 20 cheaper and it was a 2005 instead of the 2006 they offered . <sssss> right off the bat , we had dirty silverware and had to ask for clean ones . <sssss> we started of with a soup ... taste was good , but eat one of us ended up with a different portion of pork ... me being the least amount . <sssss> the salad came out and we got 3 halfs of shrimp , when everyone else got 3 hole shrimp . <sssss> we got through the entire bottle of wine before our dinner came out , thats how slow eat course came out . <sssss> the main corse came out and we all got the kangaroo , once again not one of us got the same amount of food and each one of us had a different doneness of the meat . <sssss> finally dessert came out and i was super excited to try it . <sssss> the waiter brought us out new silverware for our dessert , and once again we had to ask for some clean ones . <sssss> once we got the dessert , we found that the meringue was too hard to cut with our forks and was n't worth all the trouble to eat it . <sssss> i would not recumend this place for people that like good food . <sssss> please spend less money and go to la stalla in down town chandler . <sssss> we are mad at ourselves for not going there tonight . <sssss> make sure when you go to la stalla , you get a shot of lemon chello at the end of dinner , its homemade , like everything they have there . <sssss> the bes part of la stalla is there prices are cheaper then the cork , and its worth every penny . 
2		well ... just got done with new year 's day brunch here , and it was such a horrible experience i felt compelled to write a review . <sssss> i 've only been to rebar for drinks and my friends said the food was great so i was looking forward to it today . <sssss> apparently bliss was n't prepared for the brunch crowd this morning ? <sssss> we got there at the time they were supposed to open and they were running around like chickens with their heads cut off even though there were n't many customers there yet . <sssss> when we were seated the restaurant was less than half full and they were acting like it was the biggest group they 've ever had to deal with . <sssss> they never took our drink orders before they asked what we wanted to eat . <sssss> the servers kept switching , the busers acted offended when you asked them for anything -lrb- like condiments -rrb- , it took forever to order , and most of the food was doused in pepper which bothered nearly everyone in our party of 6 . <sssss> i did n't really care for my sandwich , even though the menu stated their pretzel bread was `` famous , '' i did n't find it very tasty at all . <sssss> add on the obligatory 20 % tip for the size of our party and i left super disappointed . 
2		went to the bar for a nightcap and was utterly unimpressed -- no creativity by the bartender , basically just threw red bull in with some vodka and watermelon juice and called it something i wo n't repeat here . <sssss> i have n't tried the kitchen here , but the outdoor bar is thinly stocked with the standards and shows no signs of imagination . <sssss> at least nine | 05 had a dj - on my visit they were just pumping satellite radio . <sssss> for now , save your time . <sssss> there are better places to go in the area . 
2		great flaming cheese appetizers ... but entrees are on cold plastic plates . <sssss> nothing stays warm on their cold plastic plates . <sssss> if they could serve their hot food on heated plates like in most mexican restaurants , the food would be more enjoyable to eat warm . <sssss> same goes with the pizzas . <sssss> by the time the food is served , the plastic plates have sucked the warmth right out of the food , so the food is cold . <sssss> plastic is okay for salads , but , please turn up the heat on the hot food dishes . 
2		i 've had their food before and it was very good and last night was n't exactly an exception . <sssss> my issue is that my 8 year old had their chicken fingers , which i tried and were quite tasty . <sssss> after our meal my son stated he felt ill , and this morning woke up with a mild case of food poisoning . <sssss> i will be avoiding this place for the foreeable future . <sssss> this is unfortunate , as their enchiladas are delicious but i simply will not risk my son getting sick again . <sssss> sorry mi amigos , your apparent lack of food preparation cleanliness has lost you customer . 
2		i just left this chipotle & the guy was really cheap on both my bowl and my hubby 's burrito . <sssss> i have been to chipotle quite a bit and they have never been this cheap with the beans , meat , cheese ect . <sssss> i will visit here again but if the portion size is still super small for the price ; i wo n't be back . 
2		i 've had it with bofa and this branch in particular . <sssss> the parking lot is ridiculously small and presided over by a security guy who takes his job way too seriously -lrb- `` no , really , i 'm going to the bank ! -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> once in you 'll be greeted with the ubiquitous `` how 's it going ? '' <sssss> well , it would be going a hell of a lot better if we could drop the drivel and process my deposit , thank you . <sssss> i 've switched most of my accounts to alliance bank but still have a federal employee withholding account with the bank . <sssss> having carelessly run out of company checks i went in the other day to request a counter check . <sssss> `` i 'm sorry , we do n't do counter checks . '' <sssss> really . <sssss> is it that complicated ? <sssss> it seems they do just about everything else because every time i go i 'm stuck behind a horde of people with tales of `` the wire transfer was supposed to happen '' or `` there used to be a lot of money in this account . '' <sssss> does anyone at bofa do banking anymore ? <sssss> you know , deposits and withdrawals . <sssss> absent of drama , please . <sssss> i honestly believe bofa has made a strategic decision to be the bank for the masses . <sssss> that 's fine but it no longer includes me . 
2		over-rated ! <sssss> 2 hour wait on a wednesday . <sssss> service sucked . <sssss> -lrb- 1 server rolled his eyes on my wife while we ordering -rrb- really ? <sssss> after we wait for 2 hours i expext better service and food ! <sssss> pizza is ok not worth the wait and the hassle . 
2		we used to frequrent the native off guadalupe and dobson before we moved to this side of town , we loved the food there and the servers . <sssss> however we have gone to this location a half dozen times and the last 3 times we were very unsatisfied with the service and the warmth -lrb- lack of -rrb- of the wings . <sssss> the last time we went we had brought our 3 month old -lrb- first wing and beer outing in how long ?? -rrb- <sssss> after we were completely done and the server received her tip she told us that we could not have our baby in the bar . <sssss> really if that was your policy it would have been better to know at the onset . 
2		we keep coming back so that must say something ... the food is good . <sssss> . <sssss> sometimes it a miss though . <sssss> but hands down the worse service ever and that never changes each time we come back !! <sssss> food good . <sssss> . <sssss> could be better and do n't charge for sour cream but let 's get the service better please , would hate to stop coming here 
2		i have mixed reviews of this bar & grill . <sssss> warning : this place is only open on game days . <sssss> their answering machine does n't tell you that !! <sssss> first , it 's a cool place . <sssss> i went here before the diamondbacks game . <sssss> it 's cold inside , the 5 or so tvs are nice , nice low tables & hi-tops . <sssss> not over the top crowded . <sssss> this is a good place to drink before or after the game . <sssss> the bottled beer was $ 2.50 . <sssss> this is definitely priced below other places around the ballpark . <sssss> other places , on average , are about $ 4.00 a bottle . <sssss> however , we were n't impressed with the food . <sssss> there were no food specials , but then again , none of the other bars around the ballpark have food specials . <sssss> the menu is limited to sandwiches , brats , burgers , and typical appetizers like nachos & wings . <sssss> when i looked on their menu on-line , it was very different . <sssss> the menu was much more extensive offering steaks , ribs , chicken , etc. . <sssss> . <sssss> but none of this was on the actual menu . <sssss> this is why we went there , for the steaks . <sssss> we got a 1/3 lb burger plate and a brat plate . <sssss> the burger with cheese & bacon was $ 9.25 and had onion rings . <sssss> the burger was no where near the stated 1/3 lb . <sssss> it was a dinky , crappy little burger . <sssss> in my opinion , way overpriced for what you got . <sssss> the brat plate was $ 6.75 or so . <sssss> decent brat loaded with sauerkraut . <sssss> however , the brat was suppose to come with grilled onions and beer battered sauerkraut . <sssss> there was n't a single onion on it and the kraut was very plain and i thought tasted bad . <sssss> my side cup of potato soup was really good . <sssss> all in all , i would not go here for the food . <sssss> it 's overpriced and not so great tasting . <sssss> the drinks are priced well . <sssss> it 's a nice place to hang and have a drink . <sssss> food , i would go to cooperstown . 
2		went here on christmas day after church just to try it out . <sssss> food is what you 'd expect , nothing special , nothing horrible . <sssss> but , the service was atrociously slow ... waited 45 minutes before they took our order . <sssss> waitress was apologetic and very friendly , but maybe they were short handed because of the holiday . <sssss> nonetheless , nothing would make me return here ! 
2		i really want to like this place , i really do . <sssss> but , they have yet to get a single order correct . <sssss> still good sandwiches , but not what i order . <sssss> wrote in to the customer service e-mail twice and they could not bother themselves with even a simple acknowledgment that they got it ... just really really bad customer care ... 
2		i 've stopped here a few times on my way to vegas . <sssss> the alternative is to fight for a parking space at mcdonalds up the street and somehow fighting to park at mcdonalds just feels wrong . <sssss> the building is different than most burger kings and has what looks to be a nice shady patio for outdoor summer dining . <sssss> just before 9am they were out of biscuits . <sssss> and the restroom could use some attention . <sssss> i ended up taking a breakfast ciabatta sandwich , which was pretty good , and a small decaf on the road with me . <sssss> the seattle 's best version of decaf is no better than what it replaced and in the small version uses a cup that does n't work well in my cup holders . <sssss> i 'll probably stop here again in the future because it is convenient but i am still not very impressed . 
2		i ordered 2 eggs over medium hashbrowns & the griddle cakes . <sssss> my husband had the classic reuben . <sssss> service - 2 stars - waitresses were rude . <sssss> and were transparently erked when we asked for non dairy creamer . <sssss> taste - 4 stars - food was really good . <sssss> but my eggs were over easy not over medium , the way i ordered them . <sssss> value - 1 star - they give you 2oz of syrup for an entire order of griddle cakes ... then charge you $ 1.50 for every 2oz of extra syrup you order . <sssss> my husbands reuben had hardly any meat on it . <sssss> overall - 2.3 ... taste was excellent but service and bang for my buck did not meet , even my most minimum of stanfards . <sssss> bottom line will i be going back ? <sssss> ... probably not . <sssss> will i recommend to a friend ... no ! 
2		took my wife here last week with flu symptoms , it was n't very busy but it still took about an hour and a half before we left . <sssss> the wait time was okay considering there was only one doctor for the whole place . <sssss> the nurse was not overly friendly as she asked all the questions that we already filled out on their forms . <sssss> i suppose the establishment serves its purpose when you ca n't get in to see your primary care doctor . 
2		my first initial meeting with leah was awesome . <sssss> my trial was based at the salon she works at in gilbert . <sssss> she was nice enough to fit me in to her schedule last minute due to my previous makeup artist/hair stylist blowing me off . <sssss> she was the 3rd person i had a trial with as all the others canceled on me . <sssss> after informing her about all of the mishaps she assured me that i could depend on her and even offered references to contact before making a final decision . <sssss> she seemed genuinely upset that i had such a hard time finding someone , so when she came to my mother in laws house almost an hour late on the day of my wedding i was in tears !!!! <sssss> after many attempts to contact her via text and phone she finally returned my call . <sssss> she kept saying we were confusing her by giving her the cross streets to my mom in laws house and that the reason she was late was because we gave her the wrong address -lrb- which is completely false as i text her the correct address the night before as she requested -rrb- and i text it to her once again that morning when she was running late . <sssss> when she arrived she was very unapologetic . <sssss> not once did she say she was sorry for being so late . <sssss> she had only 45 minutes to complete my hair , makeup , and my daughters hair as well . <sssss> to say the least i was very very disappointed because i was so rushed and it made me so nervous i could n't even enjoy myself getting ready :-lrb- for only having 45 minutes to complete everything she did a really nice job . <sssss> my hair was gorgeous , the makeup did n't look like we had planned at the trial but it was still nice , my daughters curls fell out in less than hour . <sssss> as i said before i was extremely disappointed as i thought leah was going to be what all the other reviews said she was going to be , but that just was n't the case . <sssss> everyone has bad days and things happen but do n't swear up and down your dependable only to turn out not to be and most definitely apologize when you 're at fault . <sssss> i probably would n't have been as upset about the whole ordeal if she had . 
2		holy smokes , you want how much for ice cream ? <sssss> then again , you 're looking at a guy that just buys vanilla and if i get a little bored , squirt some hersheys syrup in it and mix it up . <sssss> i guess the ice cream is good , but when i can go and buy a steak at the grocery store for the same cost , every bite i sit and imagine that i could instead be eating a ribeye cooked at home . <sssss> another thing occurred to me , what would it look like for someone to be an ice cream kneader if they werent high school aged ? <sssss> well maybe it would work if it were an older guy with a handlebar mustache . 
2		i 've been here twice now . <sssss> i would go again if a friend wanted to only because the location is perfect for before or after an asu volleyball game . <sssss> the happy hour is decent . <sssss> $ 3 vodka & cranberry . <sssss> $ 3 garlic mushrooms . <sssss> i would n't pay more than that for either item . <sssss> i tried the $ 1.99 veggies with medium buffalo sauce and blue cheese . <sssss> of course the veggie and blue cheese were fine but i did n't care for the medium flavored buffalo sauce . <sssss> i also had the soft pretzels with queso and garlic parm sauce . <sssss> the pretzels are small and hard and have no flavor . <sssss> the queso is icky and so is the garlic parm sauce . <sssss> i like that kid drinks are free but my kids did n't care for the wings , boneless wings or small burger . <sssss> they do like the dessert pizza but it is $ 7 !!! <sssss> plus they had no cheesecake bites the second time we had it . <sssss> the service once was fine and the second time was horrible and slow . <sssss> also the tv 's are so loud it hurts my ears . 
2		scale of 1-10 -lrb- multiple visits -rrb- : 7 food 8 service 8 atmosphere 4 value half the things i 've had here are amazing - the other half are average ; but the prices make even the amazing things hard for me to justify . <sssss> then there 's the fact that they are a part of the trendy problem of over-frosting cupcakes . <sssss> the way cupcakes are treated today by `` artisan '' bakeries , you 'd think they were called cupfrostings . <sssss> tammy coe : guilty . 
2		ordered two 44 strawberry fruit slush and one corn dog . <sssss> gave 5.39 , bill was 3.39 and serena tries to give me $ 1.00 and change back and two 32 oz drinks . <sssss> :--lrb- i brought change to her attention and had to check size on cup . <sssss> on a more recent trip through the drive through i again had a similar experience in which the cashier at the window did not give me all my change . <sssss> i 'm not tipping a buck to these people when i come through the drive through . <sssss> seriously , this is ridiculous that they even attempt to pull off this little maneuver . 
2		we visited chompies nearly every sunday for 5 years . <sssss> the food for us was really good until about 2 years ago , the quality started going down hill , i imagine it was due to the economy . <sssss> we still went religiously , even though the food was hit or miss . <sssss> about 4 months ago we went and i had the worst experience of my life . <sssss> i ordered my usual , the eggs benny with smoked salmon ... when they dish was brought out i could smell the fish , i knew it was n't fresh . <sssss> after arguing with the waitress she took it back and brought me a new one , which still smelled aweful , i took a few bites and could n't finish it . <sssss> 45 minutes later i experience the worst food poisoning of my life ... i called to let them know to not use that fish , no idea if the message got to the kitchen ... emailed them a complaint and never heard a word . <sssss> all hope is not lost though ! <sssss> we found a new local breakfast place that we love , so maybe it is for the better . <sssss> you will be missed chompies ... 
2		i really wanted to like this place . <sssss> due to poor service and overpriced entrees , they only get 2 stars . <sssss> we ordered the black bean fritters with avocado dip , the pulled pork , the cuban style steak and flan for dessert . <sssss> it was just `` ok . '' <sssss> the food alone was at least 3 stars ; however , in my opinion the price was too expensive for the quality of their food . <sssss> if i 'm going to pay $ 30 for my meal , i want to at least sit on a non-patio plastic chair . <sssss> on to the service ... the whole time , we wished we had the other waiter . <sssss> he seemed happy to work there and was so informative to his customers . <sssss> our server was more concerned about pushing us to order more food that she decided to slack on her waitressing abilities -lrb- i.e. refilling water -rrb- . <sssss> she would say subtle things to make us feel like we were not ordering enough , such as `` that 's it ! <sssss> just one dessert ? <sssss> , '' `` any other appetizer ? <sssss> , '' `` are you sure you do n't want a sangria ? '' <sssss> these were n't said with a smile either . <sssss> she was worried about her tip amount , and she should be after how she treated us . <sssss> needless to say , i would have given them 1 star but the food made up for it . <sssss> i think i 'll try some place else for my cuban fix . 
2		eh . <sssss> not many flavors , my favorite ones were out of order , fewer toppings than other places , and it was too crowded . <sssss> not a bad thing , but the whole place was in a certain state of disarray . <sssss> i 've had better . 
2		typical contract shenanigans , like buying a used car , maybe worse . <sssss> machines have stayed unrepaired for months . <sssss> staff come and go like a there 's a revolving door behind the desk . <sssss> movie cardio room seems good at first , until you watch bruce almighty for the umpteenth time . <sssss> when the movie needs restarted , you interrupt your workout , walk downstairs , ask the newest worker checking people in to restart when they are n't busy , and go back up to the cardio room -- or you watch the preview loop until a salesperson walks in for the 3rd time and does ' t want to get called out on his last 2 broken promises to get someone to start it . <sssss> the y was worse . <sssss> next . 
2		marginal food , small portions , over-priced . <sssss> service was awful . <sssss> pass 
2		i 've been to a much nicer amusment park or even just a fair . <sssss> $ 25 for unlimited rides that open at 6pm-11pm for me sound like a ripped off . <sssss> the rides are kinda lame . <sssss> this place is poorly designed . <sssss> they 're trying to fit as much in such a small space . <sssss> the wait for rides are n't long at all i guess that 's a good part . <sssss> it 's so sad that phoenix is a big city but this is all we 've got . 
2		not a fan . <sssss> spending a lot of time in chandler , i have been trying to find some good places to shop other than the mall . <sssss> this shopping center will not be in the rotation . <sssss> it 's set up a little differently , more urban-like i guess , but it 's the same old shopping and restaurant chains . <sssss> dillard 's is an `` anchor '' , but i 'm never that impressed with them . <sssss> macy 's is on the way , which is slightly better i guess . <sssss> parking is a pain . <sssss> not an easy in , shop , out ... but what strip mall is , right ? <sssss> the only plus is that the stores are somewhat organized into teeny-boppers and adults , meaning that when i wanted to hit up banana republic , white house/black market , and ann taylor they were right next to each other . <sssss> i 'd much rather shop at dana park village square , which at least has some non-chain stores and lots of easy parking . <sssss> if i want the department stores , i 'll head to the mall . 
2		not even close to authentic mexican food . <sssss> the guacamole was the only item that was decent other than that everything was bland . <sssss> i would not go back there again . <sssss> on top of that the food was way overpriced . 
2		i want to create a time line showing how bajio went from my favorite early release destination way back in high school to its current situation . <sssss> i can only guess that the brief period that the restaurant closed down only to be reopened under new ownership was the tipping point into bad food territory . <sssss> thanks to henry ford , this place uses an assembly line to create the americanized mexican food that it churns out for its customers . <sssss> i usually get a plain bean and cheese burrito because i 'm not a big fan of most of their toppings . <sssss> i 've always liked that the food comes with free chips and salsa . <sssss> i 've tried other menu options like salads and chicken burritos , and everything is just so-so . <sssss> i want this place to return to its former glory with the shouting for tips such , but i think that the current environment is here to stay . 
2		growing up in long island , ny -lrb- and making frequent trips to brooklyn & manhattan -rrb- i have to honestly say that as far as old time ice cream parlors go ... this leaves a lot to be desired . <sssss> however , that 's not to say that this is n't a gem to be enjoyed . <sssss> old town scottsdale on a sunday afternoon -lrb- as i experienced it on vacation last week -rrb- is quiet and hot . <sssss> there was n't too much to do and the kids were getting restless . <sssss> that being said , it was only 1pm and it was lunch time . <sssss> the bright pink building can be seen from quite the distance and certainly stands out on the main road -lrb- scottsdale rd -rrb- in old town scottsdale . <sssss> besides , any place that 's been around for 50 + years has merit with me . <sssss> one piece of advice i 'd offer is keep it simple . <sssss> a burger is an ok order , but stay away from the reuben . <sssss> should be simple , but somehow ... outside of ny ... i rarely get one that 's worthy of the name . <sssss> and this was no exception . <sssss> big gripe : no fries ??? <sssss> they serve potato chips with all their sandwiches , no fries . <sssss> do n't get me wrong i like their `` kettle chips '' -lrb- which are n't made there , but instead probably poured from oversized bags in the back -rrb- . <sssss> but a true old time parlor should have french fries . <sssss> ok , end of gripe . <sssss> now to the ice cream . <sssss> i wo n't comment on how they make it or give a review of all their flavors 'cause frankly i did n't have much . <sssss> i had a coffee shake which was quite good actually . <sssss> my mother-in-law got the '23 skiddoo '' that i was eyeing and she was quite happy with it ... it was dutch chocolate ice cream & turkish coffee ice cream , with coffee syrup , sliced almonds , whipped cream & a cherry . <sssss> it looked great and got a thumbs up from mom . <sssss> my wife ordered a mint chocolate chip sundae -lrb- her favorite flavor -rrb- and enjoyed it . <sssss> the kids ... well , the kids are easy to please . <sssss> just stick any ice cream in front of them with some cherries on top and they 're happy . <sssss> overall it was a good stop and had fantastic , friendly service . <sssss> the attached arcade left alot to be desired , but it seamed to me to be a cheap add on to a well established parlor . 
2		not a bad place if you 're really hungry and had no other place to go . <sssss> my co-workers like the original one better and i have to agree . 
2		expensive for the lack of amenities . <sssss> parking was $ 28 and daily wifi was $ 10 . <sssss> the room was small with a very tiny bathroom . <sssss> when we questioned the high parking rate the attendant laughed at us . <sssss> during the hot summer months we could have stayed at a nearby 5 star resort for less money . <sssss> even motel 6 has free wifi ! <sssss> my opinion they should drop the regency from their name . <sssss> there was no sign of regency here . 
2		well , i 've been a few times and it 's been pretty good . <sssss> i love their hot dogs , aside from the fact that their mustard is bland and the only reason you know it 's mustard is because it 's yellow ... but the reason i 'm writing is that one of my coworkers and my boss just went and got salads . <sssss> my boss got the wonton chicken salad without the wontons ; not that bad i know , but this was 1/2 an hour after my coworker got a grilled chicken salad with no chicken and no side muffin . <sssss> adding this to my own experiences where the italian beef was really bland -lrb- and yes , i got the peppers and gravy so it was soggy , slimy and bland -rrb- and when i ordered cheese fries the cheese was all over the inside of the bag and not in the container , well , i think i 'll stick with driving a ways to uncle sam 's . 
2		honestly , not impressed . <sssss> my bread was so dry and stale 
2		not bad , but not very good . <sssss> first , i why does `` the keg '' not have any beer to speak of ? <sssss> i was dumbfounded to learn they had three beers available . <sssss> the service was very attentive and both the hostess and our server were great , but everything else was middle of the road at best . <sssss> the mixed drinks were poorly done and the food was nothing special . 
2		the gas was $ .02 cheaper than gas buddy had posted . <sssss> that 's a plus . <sssss> the area where the fountain drinks are located was just disgusting . <sssss> every step was echoed with the sound of pulling your shoe/foot up off of the floor . <sssss> it was almost as if they had mopped the area with fountain soda and left it to dry . <sssss> just gross . <sssss> everything else seemed fine but could n't understand why they seemed to be fully staffed and the area by the drinks was in such horrible condition . 
2		the sushi was so-so , but the service was slow and the prices were bad . <sssss> they also were out of soy paper the day i was there which was a let down . <sssss> there are plenty of other delicious sushi/japanese places in the valley . <sssss> really no need to go here . <sssss> also , they serve their edamame cold . 
2		the concept of this place is fast casual , minus the fast part . <sssss> i have been here several times due to its proximity to work but i find that the time it takes to get your food is not conducive to a work day lunch . <sssss> they also do not offer pizza by the slice so if i am by myself grabbing a quick bite i go for a panini -lrb- which are just ok -rrb- and a side salad . <sssss> they do n't let you swap it for the chips so you have to pay extra for the salad and they do n't let you get once of the `` fancy '' salads in a side portion . <sssss> overall , i think the only time this place works is if you have some time to kill and a few other people with you so you can share a pizza and salad . <sssss> but on those occasions i can think of half a dozen other places at the same price point that i would rather go to in the area with better food and ambiance . <sssss> i.e. fifth and wine , herb box market , olive and ivy marketplace , gelato spot , etc. etc. . 
2		horrible . <sssss> missed delivery . <sssss> twice . <sssss> impossible to actually get a note to delivery person , the operators simply write it down and it never gets acted on . <sssss> they are pretty good at saying `` i 'm sorry '' and did give me half my money back after 2 missed deliveries and 6 phone calls to try to get them to surprise a friend at work . <sssss> i ended up having to call her for an address she would be at between 8-5 ... blah ... blah ... blah ... thanks for facilitating the romantic gesture , corporate weasels . 
2		we went here when there was construction and they had a good happy hour . <sssss> i returned today and everything was horrible . <sssss> the fat tire tasted like budweiser and there were no specials for food during happy hour . <sssss> fat tire needs mixed gas not co2 . <sssss> i told this to the bar tender but he did n't care . <sssss> the food is just average , but you can buy a t-shirt with some std innuendo . 
2		this is the second applebee 's that i tried in the last year . <sssss> i went again to this one for a simple lunch with a friend , and we decided to try the 2 for $ 20 special again . <sssss> once again , i was disappointed -- so i must remember to honor the old saying , `` fool me once , shame on you ; fool me twice shame on me '' . <sssss> we shared the one appetizer , and we selected the fried mozzarella sticks . <sssss> they were bad and hard . <sssss> my friend order the sw shrimp and pasta dish and that looked pretty bad -lrb- i did not get a chance to taste it -rrb- . <sssss> i ordered the three cheese pasta and grilled chicken . <sssss> there was some cheese on the pasta -- i could taste it , but there was no sauce or liquid -- just dry , cooked pasta , that tasted cheesy . <sssss> and my chicken was burnt and dry and overcooked . <sssss> the whole dish was disturbingly dry and bad !! <sssss> i know that what they show on their tv advertising and on their menus are `` doctored '' and `` made up '' dishes to make them `` show '' better for advertising purposes . <sssss> but what they actually serve is pretty bad and that is a travesty . <sssss> i think the other `` semi-fast food '' places like olive garden , chili 's , and red lobster , have better food . <sssss> and i think applebee 's would be better off -lrb- or perhaps their customers -rrb- if they provided small salads instead of the sickly `` one appetizer to share '' option . <sssss> so if anyone ever sees me write another applebee 's review , slap me up against the side of my head !! 
2		food was tasty . <sssss> service was slow . <sssss> i have been back twice since this dinner , and my two-star review stands . <sssss> the food is no doubt good . <sssss> however the wait time is extremely lacking and will make me consider other establishment in the future . 
2		we tried this for the first time tonight and were n't impressed . <sssss> the service was great and very friendly , but the food was virtually tasteless . <sssss> we ordered cashew chicken , kung pao chicken and house fried rice . <sssss> the two chicken dishes were pretty much the same except the kung pao had a slight kick to it . <sssss> but otherwise , neither had any flavor . <sssss> i had to use soy sauce to get flavor . <sssss> the fried rice was fine , but nothing special . <sssss> we were really hopeful for a neighborhood chinese restaurant , but so far , this is n't it . <sssss> something no one else mentioned is that they do n't yet have a liquor license , so no alcohol is available -lrb- and on this night , no lemonade either -rrb- . <sssss> we really wanted to like this place . <sssss> too bad . <sssss> i 'm not sure we 'll go back , but might consider going again after they 've been around a bit longer . 
2		i ca n't work at home because the bed always calls my name . <sssss> so i needed a place to go where it would slightly uncomfortable to sleep at , offered free-wi-fi and possibly have cute boys i can pretend to not stare at . <sssss> mama java 's fulfilled one of my requirements : it was definitely not a place i could nap at . <sssss> there are lots of tables , not enough outlets for your laptop and only one couch that i would n't even think about having drunk sex on . <sssss> to be fair , this is a coffee shop , not a whore house so ignore my last comment . <sssss> what i meant was that it is n't a cozy place , rather cold , actually . <sssss> i 'm used to smaller coffee places where its warm from the steaming coffee cups , the closeness of people sitting around me and the many couches or arm chairs . <sssss> i just need a hug at mama java 's . <sssss> there was only one guy at the counter when i was there and a long line but i do n't have anything important to get to so i did n't mind the wait . <sssss> i ordered a non-fat chai latte and it okay . <sssss> too sugary and strong spices . <sssss> i 'm actually writing this review as i 'm finishing up here at mama java 's . <sssss> it 's getting cold and i have to go pee really bad , so i have to wrap up this review and head home , which is just down the street . <sssss> i have a shy bladder . 
2		i 'm underwhelmed by chelsea 's food and annoyed by their shutting down at 10 pm on a friday night . <sssss> the atmosphere is nice enough , although the space is so massive that it has that subtle , distinct overpriced-cafeteria flavor that lgo seems to have mastered . <sssss> i ordered a 12 dollar `` santa fe green chile burger '' , which the menu describes as having the following ingredients : `` wood-fired poblano chile , lettuce , tomato , onion , cheddar cheese & chipotle aoli . '' <sssss> sounds glorious , does n't it ? <sssss> unfortunately , all that glory basically amounts to what looked and tasted to me like a plain hamburger with a slice of velveeta slopped on top in between two buns . <sssss> nowhere did i detect a hint of the famed `` wood-fired poblano chile '' . <sssss> i confess that i do n't actually know what `` chipotle aoli '' is , so i ca n't tell you if there was any on the burger . <sssss> maybe `` chipotle aoli '' is like carbon monoxide : you ca n't smell , taste , see or otherwise detect it ? 
2		nice facility . <sssss> but most of the staff is very rude . <sssss> especially the lady in the reception and batting cage . 
2		disappointing . <sssss> some of the food that should have been served hot was actually cold and must have been sitting in the cart for too long . <sssss> would not go back again . 
2		it 's pretty tough to find decent chinese in scottsdale . <sssss> jade palace is an ok option if you have a serious craving for chinese , but rarely will you think `` gee , let 's go to jade palace to get some quality food '' . <sssss> the food is mediocre at best . <sssss> nothing really stands out on the menu . <sssss> i 've been a handful of times because it 's so close to where i live ... each time i get something different hoping for the best . <sssss> each time i walked away thinking i should have spent my money elsewhere . <sssss> if considering jade palace , ask yourself this : do i have a serious craving for chinese that wont go away if i eat anything else ? <sssss> do i live within 5 minutes of jade palace ? <sssss> do i like dining with people who average 85 years old ? <sssss> if yes , go . <sssss> otherwise move on ... 
2		so i had this $ 25 gift certificate from restaurant.com that clearly stated `` no expiration date '' and what happens ? <sssss> they wo n't take it . <sssss> so yeah , i 've had it forever and always forgot to bring it with me but that 's beside the point - it says `` no expiration '' !!! <sssss> so starting off on the wrong foot , we stood in the doorway for a while until i chased down a waitress to ask where we could sit . <sssss> the patio and bar were full and only one table was available inside . <sssss> we sat and were quickly attended to by a great server -lrb- eddie -rrb- who was obviously super busy but never once ignored us . <sssss> the food was so-so ; i remember it being better in the past when this place was not nearly as busy . <sssss> the calamari was a bit soggy but decent tasting and the rock shrimp tempura was slightly soggy as well but out of this world in flavor ! <sssss> all of the sushi rolls on the special menu were either deep fried or covered in spicy mayo . <sssss> you think i kid ; i do n't . <sssss> and honestly , something tasted off , not super fishy but like the hamachi had been previously frozen for a month and was n't fresh ? <sssss> unfortunately tammy was n't behind the bar so i did n't stop to piss and moan and make a scene but had she been there and had a moment to chat -lrb- like she has in the past -rrb- i probably would have said something . <sssss> even though i really want to give this place 1 star for tonight 's several moments of wtf , eddie was a killer attentive server , the food was expeditiously prepared , i think tammy is a cool chick , and the all-day happy hour and sushi costs ca n't be beat anywhere in this state . <sssss> i used to think pearl was a underrated , hidden gem but apparently some of the quality has suffered with the increase in business . <sssss> too bad , now it 's just a place you can say `` you get what you pay for '' and that is truly unfortunate . 
2		i was invited to meet there for lunch recently for business . <sssss> we ate outside on very uncomfortable metal chairs . <sssss> the view was nice of the top of camelback , but that was the only bright spot for me that day . <sssss> i ordered the west veggie burger but they were out of the soy bacon . <sssss> and i said that 's fine , i do n't need that , and then they said that they were out of another ingredient and suggested i order something else . <sssss> that was fine . <sssss> i settled on the ziti al forno . <sssss> then another waitress came out and told me that the ziti would take another 30 minutes to cook . <sssss> and i asked my business associate if that was ok . <sssss> it was and so i said , no problem . <sssss> then like two minutes later my food was on my table . <sssss> hmmm ... and this was about four ounces of ziti smothered in this very cheezy -lrb- ricotta like -rrb- red sauce . <sssss> the flavor was bland and the pasta was overcooked . <sssss> it was almost a mushy consistency . <sssss> the highlight of the dish was two small wedges of garlic bread and a sprinkling of chopped nuts on top . <sssss> that gave it some much needed texture . <sssss> all this for $ 14 ... yikes ! <sssss> since it was a tea room , i did order a tea and was surprised at the presentation . <sssss> it was a small cafeteria-style glass . <sssss> i think i would suggest to them to work on their presentation a little more . <sssss> that was $ 3 but it could have gone up to $ 6 if i added two more tea leaf combos to it . <sssss> my friend did order the soup of the day which sounded pretty good . <sssss> i would probably go back there again to try some of the other food . <sssss> this review is only based on one visit . <sssss> i think it might be worth a second look . <sssss> i 'm hoping my next visit is a better one . 
2		both the cab driver and the hotel recommended los olivos , so i was expecting an authentic mexican dinner . <sssss> what we got was poorly flavored food and disappointment . <sssss> all 8 members of my party thought their meals were sub-par . <sssss> however , the bartenders were outstanding ! <sssss> go for the margaritas as miguel makes his without mix the way they should be and with fresh lime juice ! 
2		good steak place . <sssss> nothing special . <sssss> a bit pricey . <sssss> hard to find parking . <sssss> good wine selection tho . 
2		what can i say about circle k ? <sssss> well , first of all , no gas here . <sssss> secondly , it is the same as any other circle k - ice , booze , gum , and soda . <sssss> i normally go to qt but unfortunately my brother 's car was towed while partying in scottsdale so we had to walk to the nearest atm , which was at circle k. on a side note - the lot looks like it 's had better days ... for being in scottsdale i figured it would n't look like it had 28 cars leaking oil on it . <sssss> 2-stars because it does n't have gas and qt is far superior . 
2		i stop by this location every now and then on my way to work on weekends . <sssss> that pretty much means i 'm too lazy to cook a good breakfast , but want something more than cereal . <sssss> i 've never had the major issues other people are yelping about . <sssss> perhaps things have improved since then . <sssss> i find that if you stick to a bagel and cream cheese , all is well . <sssss> but -lrb- and i find this the case with most einsteins -rrb- if you try to order anything hot , you 're about to get what tastes like an over priced frozen microwave meal . 
2		i walked around yesterday at at and was extremely disappointed . <sssss> it again looks trashy , junky and no better than a bad thrift store ! <sssss> i started shopping there at least 10 years ago but my visits have become farther and farther apart as the years have gone by ! <sssss> gone are the wheelers and dealers that made their junk at least presentable and reasonable ... but left long ago ! <sssss> who wants to see the same crap 6 months later ??? <sssss> come on , people -rrb- : most booths have no theme , no presentation and management needs to help with merchandising and fair pricing ! <sssss> i am bypassing this junk hole and heading to 7th ave and cave creek rd for attractive displays , reasonable prices and fun decor ! <sssss> take it from me , antique trove , you need a management and dealer overhaul !!! <sssss> i ca n't believe you tolerate this after opening your roseville , ca location that is 10x better ! 
2		this place is grossly overpriced . <sssss> not even worth the time to write a detailed review . <sssss> if you like being ripped off go here . 
2		ok , why am i giving such a well-reviewed yogurt shop a measly 2 stars ? <sssss> read on if you 'd like the dirty , stomach-churning details . <sssss> i stopped by here yesterday , because i truly enjoy this shop . <sssss> i love the cleanliness , the large selection of toppings , the clearly labeled no sugar added , vegan , and dairy-free choices , the clearly displayed caloric content of each flavor . <sssss> all wins ! <sssss> i had a rather nasty encounter with the management . <sssss> i 'm sure he has no idea the impression he left on me , but if he ever does see this , i hope he 'll be more aware . <sssss> i noticed this man checking up on the employee behind the counter , asking questions about other employees , and inspecting the overall facility . <sssss> the employee followed him around and was answering his questions . <sssss> i got up to leave , having enjoyed my yogurt , and proceeded to walk out the door . <sssss> as i did , this man left as well . <sssss> when i was getting in to my car , this man hocked a loogie -lrb- a loogie ! <sssss> snort-created and everything ! -rrb- <sssss> right next to my car . <sssss> it was , and still is , disgusting . <sssss> my stomach is beside itself as i type this . <sssss> i can not express how gross that is . <sssss> i was parked directly in front of the store , whose doors were open , mind you . <sssss> that means the 10 or so people inside were also privy to that display . <sssss> if i were eating , i can tell you right now that i would n't be able to finish . <sssss> so gross . <sssss> it 's shocking to me that someone in his position would do that . <sssss> i think that if he knew an employee did that , he would n't be happy about it . <sssss> that 's a horrible way to treat a business . <sssss> ew . 
2		i 've been to other ihop locations , but this one seems to be sub par . <sssss> we were seated quickly , and the waitress was ready to take our order immediately . <sssss> our waitress was super awkward and the service was poor . <sssss> she must have asked us what we would like to order about 3 times in two minutes . <sssss> are we not allowed to look over the menu ? <sssss> i ordered the strawberry banana french toast because it looked and sounded amazing on the menu . <sssss> i was severely underwhelmed . <sssss> if sugary syrupy half frozen strawberries on thinly sliced bread is your thing , you might love it ! <sssss> when checking out , they were trying to tell me i needed an id to use my visa debit card . <sssss> they hassled me for about 10 minutes over a $ 10 purchase . <sssss> it would n't have been a big deal , but my id was at home . <sssss> visa strictly prohibits merchants to require and id with a signed debit card , so i didnt bring it . <sssss> get it together ihop . <sssss> i gave two stars for cleanliness , but i wo n't return . 
2		stayed here for business last week and my reaction is : meh . <sssss> nothing special about this scottsdale road property . <sssss> it was really pretty expensive $ 279/night in april and you do n't get a lot for your money . <sssss> nothing `` wrong '' with the place , but you can do better for the money . <sssss> i do n't know how they can call it a `` resort '' unless have a pool qualifies you - no golf/tennis , no spa , etc. . <sssss> just a hotel . 
2		apparently , they 've instituted a policy of requiring that if you order a drink and sit down to enjoy it , you have to order one of their fat-laden , high calorie pastry as well . <sssss> otherwise , they wo n't sell you the drink . <sssss> disappointed . 
2		a friend of mine visiting from california stayed here one weekend . <sssss> i went to pick him up at his hotel room . <sssss> it was the first time i 've been to a red roof inn and i was n't impressed . <sssss> the room was large , but it was n't well appointed and very bland . <sssss> the elevator did n't work very well , it `` stuttered '' and gave me a sense that you could get stuck between floors ... not saying that it would do that , but it gave me that uneasy feeling . <sssss> i asked him why he selected this place and he said it was because it was cheap . <sssss> he did n't like the beds and did n't sleep well . <sssss> for the traveler on a budget , it would probably work fine . <sssss> return factor - 30 % 
2		went in on a monday night for dinner after work when i did n't feel like cooking . <sssss> they have a lot of burritos , and health conscious options . <sssss> food is okay but you 'll know exactly which farm your food came from at gallo blanco downtown and get more for your money ! <sssss> disappointing that i could n't get a cold mexican beer with lime to have with my dinner . <sssss> they do have a variety of fresh squeezed lemonade , that along with the decor makes me want to classify this as a `` lunch only '' place . <sssss> i 'm likely to try it again for lunch , but i 'll scratch it off my list as a casual dinner option . 
2		have you ever had a favorite dish at a certain place and find yourself going back again and again just for that item ? <sssss> me too . <sssss> unfortunately , i do n't have to worry about that here . <sssss> since i did my first outback store opening on rapid city , sd , over 15 years ago , nothin could beat a bloomin onion followed by my favorite cut of meat ; ribeye . <sssss> i have rarely strayed . <sssss> after work today i was craving some dead animal so much i could already taste it . <sssss> outback is closer that texas roadhouse and the nicer steakhouses in the area were n't really fit for my golf shorts and flip flops . <sssss> my girlfriend and i were seated in a booth for six . <sssss> lol . <sssss> hey , at least it was roomy , and i can eat ! <sssss> was tempted to try something different but wanted to enjoy my dinner and if i tried something new -lrb- sometimes i do -rrb- and did n't like it i would leave unsatisfied and pissy . <sssss> i ordered the bloomin onion and the 14oz ribeye with salad and garlic mashed potatoes . <sssss> she ordered the shrimp on the barbie and a cobb salad . <sssss> the onion was good as usual . <sssss> although its not rocket science to drop a vegetable in grease for a few minutes . <sssss> we 'll give them a thumbs up anyway . <sssss> remember i 'm pretty big on customer service so little things like beverage refills and butter with the bread does n't rank up there with ingenious thought concepts like the invention of the wheel or flight . <sssss> the guy who fills our soda machines at work was out sick today so we were out of a lot . <sssss> maybe he 's in charge of this outback 's butter and soda supply as well . <sssss> anyway , i 'm not sure if you all know what goes on a cobb salad in general , but i do . <sssss> so if any of you reading this know or decide to find out for yourself , could you pass it on to outback . <sssss> it looked like a chicken caesar . <sssss> the best was the two itsy bitsy cherry tomatoes cut in half . <sssss> ok , to the main issue ; my dinner , lol . <sssss> garlic mashed potatoes sucked . <sssss> what is it with phoenix restaurants that they will o.d. someone with cilantro but are at a loss with any other spice . <sssss> bland : i think i will be overusing that term a lot here . <sssss> you can always tell when they forgot about the steak they were cooking . <sssss> in this case , my mid-rare came out medium to mid-well . <sssss> that 's being generous . <sssss> it had a little pink left but was dry as a desert due to the cook putting some obvious pressure behind the steak weight . <sssss> one side was hard to even cut through because it had 99 % of the cook time and the other side barely was seared . <sssss> due to the improper cooking technique none of the seasoning stuck , hence my additional use of the word bland , again . <sssss> so it brings me back to the beginning of getting that favorite dish that keeps you coming back . <sssss> it did n't happen and i probably wo n't be back anytime soon in another futile attempt . 
2		i have been a customer of asu surplus for over 5 years . <sssss> i go every once in a while to see what they have . <sssss> on a recent visit -lrb- 9/18/2013 -rrb- we found a few small office supplies . <sssss> they are usually `` hit or miss '' but sometimes you can find magazine holders , etc. . <sssss> i found 2 matching chairs that i purchased for my sons growing gaming area . <sssss> the chairs were cumbersome and a bit heavy but i managed to sort of stack them and get them to the pay window . <sssss> they have a new cashier here . <sssss> she is `` all business '' and not very friendly . <sssss> all of the employees were sitting in the office . <sssss> it is the only place that has a/c in the building . <sssss> when i was done paying for all of my items , i asked her if she could have one of the guys help me put the chairs in my car . <sssss> she said that i was welcome to use one of their carts . <sssss> i told her that i had always received help in the past . <sssss> -lrb- i have purchased over 10 chairs ; 3 desks ; a table ; 5 or more computers and dozens of office supplies from asu surplus in the past . -rrb- <sssss> i noticed the oldest guy in the office kind of making a face . <sssss> then he and a tall , younger guy came out -lrb- sort of abruptly -rrb- and grabbed my chairs . <sssss> right away they said , where 's your vehicle ? <sssss> or something like that . <sssss> they rushed to put the chairs in the back of my suv , i said thanks , they seemed `` put out '' like i was cutting into their day . <sssss> i guess if i decide to go back ... i will have to bring a couple of movers with me ??? 
3		i do n't have much to write about this place , but i enjoyed my lunch here . <sssss> there are several choices on the menu however , after seeing shark tacos , i knew that is what i wanted . <sssss> -lrb- i 've eaten shark before , but never in a taco -rrb- it was good ! <sssss> it was served with black beans , rice and guacamole . <sssss> the margarita i ordered was good also . 
3		5/29/10 came in after a failed attempt to dine at zin burger next door -lrb- i ended up ordering only the sweet potato fries there - not good . <sssss> very soggy . -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> nice friendly greeting at the door , and i was seated right away . <sssss> -lrb- sad to see tfk 's business was much slower than that of zb 's . -rrb- <sssss> ordered my favorite , the onion tart , but i also wanted to try something new - the columbia river steelhead salmon , which the menu promised it comes with shiso -lrb- red or green leafy greens -rrb- , lime , avocado -lrb- hold the avo , please ! -rrb- <sssss> , and cilanto aioli . <sssss> it is served on the bread made in-house . <sssss> for dessert , i tried the chocolate muffin/cake w / organic butter ice cream , organic chocolate sauce , and cocoa nibs -lrb- ! -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> the salmon sandwich was excellent !! <sssss> everything that comprised this sandwich was fabulous , from the whole-grain and veggie bread and the lime and cilantro aioli slathered on it , to the oh-so-moist medium-rare salmon , tomato , and the not-so-usual leafy topping , shiso . <sssss> it took all my willpower to not eat the entire thing ! <sssss> i wish i could say the same about the kale salad and sweet potato hash ... the kale was so tough to chew . <sssss> however , chewing would n't have been such a task if the kale was n't also very dry ! <sssss> my salad was pretty rough , so i abandoned it right away . <sssss> -lsb- i know that kale is so very good for me , but sometimes what 's good for my health is n't so great for my digestive system :-lrb- -rsb- i was n't a fan of their hash in the past , and tonight 's side dish did n't win me over , either . <sssss> i wo n't give it another chance . <sssss> another disappointment was the onion tart . <sssss> first , the presentation left me wondering who took a chunk off my plate and ate it ? <sssss> no , this was just how it was assembled and baked , i was told . <sssss> variances , he said . <sssss> the exquisite crunch i so loved in this pizza was gone , and so was the flavor . <sssss> very bland . <sssss> another menu item i must cross of my list :-lrb- oh , but the dessert !! <sssss> very moist cake , which sat on silky , rich organic dark chocolate sauce , with lovely -lrb- ! -rrb- <sssss> crushed cocoa nibs - loved that crunch ! <sssss> i think i surprised my server by guessing correctly what those nibs were ! <sssss> -lrb- i 've had them before in trail snack bags from whole foods . -rrb- <sssss> the best part ? <sssss> why , the homemade butter ice cream ! <sssss> i need to go back and have another scoop -lrb- or two ! -rrb- <sssss> very soon ... excellent service - very informative . <sssss> kudos to my server who never showed impatience after having to answer all of my questions - some of which he had to go back to the kitchen a few times , too ! <sssss> thank you very much ! 
3		though this place truly looks like a dive , i had high expectations - for the food , at least - because of a glowing review i read in one of the local journals . <sssss> the place looks a tad decrepit and while the tables look clean , their surfaces did have a bit of a sticky feel to them . <sssss> on one occasion i had the huaracha recommended by the review i read . <sssss> it was a generous portion of food and it tasted good , though it was a bit on the dry side . <sssss> on a second visit , this time with my friend rand r. , i ordered a variety of street tacos - al pastor , carne asada , carnitas , and chorizo . <sssss> they were very good , especially when you add the salsa offered on the side . <sssss> the horchata i ordered with the tacos was good and was the perfect accompaniment fo the tacos . <sssss> in all , my dining experiences here were a-ok , though i 'd rather go to tacos atoyac for similarly-priced but higher-quality food ... and tables with a cleaner feel . 
3		after reading the other reviews on yelp , my friend and i made it a point to go out here while we were in town . <sssss> i really was n't that impressed . <sssss> it 's a little shop in a big mall , on the top level . <sssss> kind of out of the way . <sssss> i got to try the raspberry white chocolate peanut butter . <sssss> eh . <sssss> only had one tiny taste , as they pretty much handed it to me when we went in there . <sssss> white chocolate peanut butter , tasted mostly like a sweeter peanut butter . <sssss> could n't taste any form of chocolate . <sssss> the mocha peanut butter was not good at all . <sssss> there was too much of a fake coffee taste that over powered the whole thing . <sssss> the caramel crunch was great with apples . <sssss> got too sweet after a while , the chunks were too many in the volume of peanut butter . <sssss> we got the sampler . <sssss> which is why we had three peanut butters . <sssss> they have a plate of celery -lrb- which was really fresh and clean -rrb- , carrots -lrb- which we asked to omit -rrb- , pretzels , and green apples -lrb- so tasty -rrb- . <sssss> their sandwiches looked interesting , but i am just a plain old peanut butter on white bread kind of girl . <sssss> it was a nice little break , and it is a great concept of a snack shop . <sssss> i am just fickle about my peanut butter i guess . 
3		if you prefer locally-owned over starbucks , then come here . <sssss> but do n't expect a whole lot of seating in this small coffee shop . 
3		i used to love this place ... they 're still pretty good now but not what they used to be . <sssss> the croissants used to be * stuffed * with the various delicious fillings , and now they definitely do n't put as much of the yum in there . <sssss> the croissants also seem to be a bit more dry than i recalled . <sssss> still a good treat though . 
3		not too busy mid-day . <sssss> lots of indoor and outdoor seating . 
3		my boyfriend and i dined at hana tonight , and despite the numerous four and five star reviews , i was not too impressed . <sssss> i found the prices to be pretty steep for smaller portions than most places , and the food to be of only moderate quality . <sssss> i did appreciate the authentic atmosphere , it was perfect for our date night . <sssss> however , my boyfriend and i found ourselves a little creeped out by our server who paced the small restaurant while we decided what we would order , and lingered near the table just a little bit too long every time he checked on us . <sssss> all in all , the food was decent , but overpriced , i will be sticking to moto on 16th street and glendale . 
3		when this place first opened up i tried it and i had a great experience . <sssss> the steak was great and the service was too ! <sssss> after about 6 months the service was lacking and the quality of the food wasnt close to what it was before . <sssss> i think the concentration was more on getting out the booze than getting out good food . 
3		what happens when a croatian family , 2 gays and a brood of cenpho peeps head to the westside for a birthday brunch at ... * gasp * ... a chain restaurant . <sssss> well , i 'll tell ya what happens . <sssss> big fun . <sssss> that 's what ! <sssss> we had at least 20 people and took over an entire room in back . <sssss> that was smart of them as we were a `` lively '' group . <sssss> granted it took quite a while to get drinks out to us , but i 'm a restaurant person and forgive easier than others . <sssss> we had strawberry mimosas served with a split of freixenet . <sssss> fantastic ! <sssss> i had the cordon blue crepes with ham , swiss , onion and eggs topped with dijon cream sauce ... seriously ... they were heavenly . <sssss> i was last to be served so i was nervous my crepes would be petrified . <sssss> they were piping hot ! <sssss> also on my plate were fresh grapes . <sssss> they were chilled & snappy . <sssss> kind of like angelina joilie 's personality . <sssss> i have to say the place was pretty messy , including the restroom , which oddly smelled like the men 's restroom at the esplanade . <sssss> i 'll remember you mimi . <sssss> next year , when i 'm visiting the westside again , i may swing by for those crepes . <sssss> oh . <sssss> one weird thing happened . <sssss> after a few of us had ordered our third strawberry mimosa , we were told they had no more champagne left . <sssss> really ? <sssss> cuz it feels like you 're cutting us off ! <sssss> whatev ! <sssss> we had consumed plenty but got a chuckle out of being cut off in a room full of coffee swilling seniors ! 
3		what would i ever do without wienerschnitzel ? <sssss> it 's my holy place . <sssss> my temple . <sssss> my place of tribute . <sssss> and i 'm not making a clever metaphor for the rise in obesity and fast food consumption . <sssss> you see , to keep in line with my religion -lrb- discordianism -rrb- , i have to eat a hot dog -lrb- or two ... or three -rrb- every friday in reverence to the goddess eris . <sssss> i 'm not making this shit up . <sssss> look it up in our scripture . <sssss> i experimented for a while in finding a suitable regular source of weenie . <sssss> at first i tried doing the `` hot dog cart outside of the store/bar/strip club '' thing , but after a while i realized that behind every smiling hot dog salesman is a tragic story of heartbreak and shattered dreams , and i began to fear that eventually hot dogs would begin to taste like cheating spouses and children who dropped out of med school with only weeks left to graduation . <sssss> i tried gas stations . <sssss> mobil on the run and quiktrip especially , because they have some of the best chili cheese dogs in all of creation . <sssss> i was content for some time , thrilled to be able to fill up my gas tank while participating in a sacred ritual . <sssss> finally , religion was serving me , instead of the other way around . <sssss> life was good . <sssss> then one day i walk into a motr and inquire the clerk as to the freshness of the dogs . <sssss> -lrb- this is a dramatization -rrb- `` good sir , how long have these franks been on yonder grill ? '' <sssss> `` i do n't know , since last night i think . '' <sssss> `` i say , that 's ludicrous ! <sssss> have you any idea how unsanitary that is ? '' <sssss> `` we leave them out until their sold . <sssss> they do the same at movie theaters . <sssss> and why do you talk like that ? <sssss> are you gay or something ? '' <sssss> `` if by ` gay ' you mean happy , sir , then no , i most certainly am not . <sssss> i am not ` gay ' about these health violations . '' <sssss> long i lingered unhappily in the desert of unhappiness where unhappy vultures feast on unhappy roadkill . <sssss> why would my god -lrb- dess -rrb- demand i ingest something so foul ? <sssss> that 's just a rhetorical question , btw . <sssss> in the principia discordia it outlines exactly why we should eat hot dogs . <sssss> eating a hot dog on a friday violates the dietary conditions of every major religion . <sssss> that 's how we roll . <sssss> at the suggestion of a friend i stumbled across wienerschnitzel , which to this day i have yet to spell correctly on the first try . <sssss> not only do they have the best chili cheese dogs i 've had in a long time , but also the best chili cheese fries , chili cheese burgers , chili cheese french fry burritos ... and they also have the hypocrisy , insincerity and apathy i look for in a religious institution . <sssss> like a sunday school teacher who tells their kids that killing is bad unless it 's america 's enemies , ws has no regard for their own doctrine . <sssss> every time i visit the drive through it 's the same noise . <sssss> `` no , you ca n't substitute your french fries for a chili cheese french fry burrito . <sssss> no , you ca n't sub out your soda for a tastee freeze . '' <sssss> yet every time i get to the counter , there 's that same shady cashier looking both ways before giving me my bag and warning me that it 's `` just this once '' and not to expect them to do me any favors next time . <sssss> that 's the kind of `` do as i say , not as i do '' attitude i expect , no , require , from a religious establishment . <sssss> i demand the same amount of two-faced clergy that is available to everyone else . <sssss> every time i hear them say `` thank you , have a nice day '' it wraps an invisible fuzzy , warm blanket over me . <sssss> it reminds me of my youth . <sssss> of cranky , obligated `` bless yous '' that come after every sound-barrier-breaking sneeze , of every dazed and listless `` may the lord be with you '' in every catholic service . <sssss> sentimentality is very important to me in a religious institution . <sssss> i may attend this temple of consumerist worship the rest of my life . <sssss> i need to be able to remember it when i 'm away , eating normal people food and doing those things that reasonable , rationally-minded people do with their free time when not eating hot dogs in heathen rituals and talking to dolphins . <sssss> and apathy . <sssss> yeah . <sssss> they 're pretty apathetic whenever i show up . <sssss> but so am i , i guess . <sssss> big deal . <sssss> who cares ? <sssss> oh , also , they charge extra for all-beef hot dogs . <sssss> which means that the lower option is made up of mystery meat . <sssss> i keep hoping i bite into one and accidentally eat a demon or something . <sssss> the best part of ws is that like a small church on the side of a country road -lrb- that 's where churches are , right ? <sssss> i have n't been to one since i attended a wedding in waco , tx -rrb- , ws has its own regulars , usually specific to each branch . <sssss> probably because with all that chili and cheese we eat , we ca n't be bothered to travel too far to you know , try other things out . <sssss> we all laugh and smile and laugh at each other , consumed by a sense of camaraderie/mutually assured destruction . <sssss> wienerschnitzel really does bring me closer to my god -lrb- dess -rrb- . <sssss> what would i do without it ? <sssss> i dunno . <sssss> eat spaghettios with hot dogs cut up in them . <sssss> at the rate i 'm going , i 'll be lucky if i can make it to the can opener without having a heart attack . 
3		the rice bowls are a yummy quick lunch ! <sssss> i have never eaten the sushi here because i am super , mega picky about sushi . <sssss> raw fish is serious people ! <sssss> i go in here on my half hour lunch break to grab a steamy hot bowl of chicken curry about once a month . <sssss> its not japanese curry like i was used to eating for the majority of my preggers days , but it will do . <sssss> of course i no longer live in japan either ... the chicken is tender the curry is savory , and the rice is well cooked and not dry . <sssss> you can get hot sauce on the side to spice to your liking . <sssss> it has a lot of potatos in it , that might be the only thing i do n't like about this curry . <sssss> i miss japan ... i would even settle for curry house coco ichibanya if there was one here . <sssss> okay my mouth is watering which means its time to go ! <sssss> oh my naughty nielly always orders the chicken teryaki bowl and that is pretty good too . <sssss> xx , reese 
3		came and got the fudge ; butter pecan , peanut butter cup , and my favorite the caramel vanilla . <sssss> good service , great fudge . 
3		this place was surprisingly better than i thought it would be . <sssss> i went here for lunch with my grandma yesterday and it was alright . <sssss> the one thing i really did n't like was that their menu had too many different types of food and the lunch specials , although plentiful , did n't look all that good to me . <sssss> so we decided to share a few apps . <sssss> we got the spring rolls , lettuce wraps , and the mozz and tomato salad . <sssss> the salad was pretty good , the balsamic on it was tangy and it was a decent deal at 3 $ . <sssss> the spring rolls were also just alright ... they were like a tex mex spring roll ... the plate has a lot of rolls , but the sauces they serve with it were n't very spicy or flavorful . <sssss> the lettuce wraps were kind of the same way ... they were a bit bland , not bad , but not good . <sssss> we ended the meal with the triple chocolate pizookie . <sssss> this was the best part ... super chocolatey and delicious . <sssss> i 'd go back if i were in the area , but for the price , it is n't anything special . 
3		this place can get really awesome or really dull dependent on one solitary man resembling a leprechaun with a filthy mouth and penchant for calling out mouthy toolbags , all while playing the guitar and happily caroling away in irish drinking hymnals . <sssss> it can get really crowded , which makes standing really tedious and plants a target on your big forehead for the leprechaun to abuse . <sssss> on st. paddy 's day , this place is chaos , and like most other forced holidays is not worth getting into the carnival atmosphere just to say you did it . <sssss> cash-only holidays get old in a hurry . 
3		this place lacks in atmosphere , but makes for it in price , location , and great food !!!! 
3		good quality , little quantity . <sssss> i do n't write many food reviews , but i felt i needed to for this place . <sssss> i attended a dinner party with ten plus people . <sssss> the ambience was great and the staff very friendly and helpful . <sssss> the menu is not only unique but really tempts one to try non-traditional plates , such as mountain oysters or tongue . <sssss> the reason for 3/5 stars is the quantity of the food provided . <sssss> it 's really good and flavorful -lrb- i had beef loin -rrb- , but the portions are small - so small that you leave hungry . <sssss> -lrb- i am medium frame man -rrb- . <sssss> i found myself eating a lot of bread to compensate . <sssss> for the price of an individual dinner plate , i can say i do n't think the place is worth it . <sssss> i would not recommend it to anyone i know . 
3		i 've been to this specific bevmo twice . <sssss> i 'm torn on whether i like it or not . <sssss> the first time i came to buy fulton 's pumpkin pie liquor for the holidays . <sssss> i heard that bevmo carried it and was excited to find it in the store . <sssss> however , compared to total wine & more , this store seems smaller and harder to find items . <sssss> -lrb- i had to ask the clerk where the item was and even he did n't know ! <sssss> my husband had to find the special pumpkin pie liquor . -rrb- <sssss> bevmo also seems to carry fewer products , but more of the high-end/strange product . <sssss> the second time i came here i needed to buy 50 mini tequila bottles for a gift bag idea . <sssss> i really wanted to buy something on the cheaper side -lrb- since i needed 50 ! -rrb- <sssss> but they only had jose cuervo at $ 2.99 a bottle . <sssss> also , they only had 24 of them . <sssss> they did offer to special order me a case , but i declined . <sssss> i headed over to total wine & more and was able to find what i needed -lrb- for $ 0.99 ! -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> overall , the clerks are nice and helpful -lrb- if you ask -rrb- but it could be hit or miss with the product . <sssss> chances are you 'll be going to total wine & more if you 're at bevmo and you 'll be coming to bevmo if you 're at total wine & more . 
3		the bagel nosh is out of business . <sssss> i was really looking forward to my bagel today . 
3		que sera , sera ... this is the second time i have eaten at ticoz . <sssss> first experience was better then the second . <sssss> stopped on for lunch on a lazy day of holiday vacation . <sssss> the place was sparsely populated . <sssss> i had the cuban sandwich -lrb- wheat bread - asked for white -rrb- . <sssss> it was actually quite tasty . <sssss> pork was good and the ham was tasty . <sssss> the bread was not what i expected , but i could work with it . <sssss> my fellow diners had shrimp street tacos , tortilla soup , and the pork torta . <sssss> the tortilla soup was tasty . <sssss> did not try the tacos , but my friends found them to be bland . <sssss> i am not really sure what to make of ticoz these days . <sssss> the food was pretty good , but it seemed to be missing something . 
3		zinburger is an interesting concept . <sssss> i like the idea of an upscale burger joint coupled with a full bar . <sssss> the look and feel of the place is casual and hip , with the clientele being mostly hipster/yuppies and business people . <sssss> although i am neither , i did n't feel entirely out of place . <sssss> maybe that was because of the friendly staff -- when people are nice and friendly to you , it always leaves a good , lasting impression . <sssss> and , the one person that was utterly delightful and charming was the bartender . <sssss> i wish i remembered his name because i was quite smitten by him . <sssss> his efficiency and friendliness only made the meal that much better . <sssss> and the meal , at least mine , was descent . <sssss> i had the turkey burger , and being the seeker of great turkey burgers , i 'd say this one was right in the middle . <sssss> for my taste , it needed a little bit more flavor to it . <sssss> but what the turkey burger lacked , the sweet potato fries made up for . <sssss> you ca n't beat a flavorful sweet potato fry for anything ! <sssss> despite my average feelings towards my meal , my mom truly enjoyed her blt salad . <sssss> it was the perfect side for her , and she said she really loved the salad dressing . <sssss> zinburger has a lot of what i look for in a restaurant experience -- nice staff , cool atmosphere and good food . <sssss> if i could , i would give it 3 3/4 stars because it is definitely `` a-ok , '' but i 'm not quite yet `` a fan . '' <sssss> i 'll definitely go back again and try some of their other offerings and decide then if i should up it a 1/4 point . <sssss> heck , i may even pull out a fiver ! 
3		another place that i really like but whose coffee is totally sub par . <sssss> bitter shots , bubbly milk in my macchiato . <sssss> good for other kinds of drinks , i 'm sure , and i love their book selection and their general seating area . <sssss> it 's very spacious . <sssss> if you 're looking for poetry slams and traditional folk company , this would be the place for you . 
3		this was home base for 4 nights . <sssss> i used some airline miles to book this hotel so i do n't know how much it would have cost had i paid $ $ for it . <sssss> there were some good things about the hotel and a couple of bad ones . <sssss> good things i liked about the hotel ------------- - location ! <sssss> this place was perfect for us . <sssss> it 's close to tempe , downtown scottsdale , freeways , dunkin donuts etc etc. . <sssss> the location was key ! <sssss> we did not have to drive far to get anywhere . <sssss> - staff . <sssss> they were very friendly and helpful . <sssss> we did not need them for much but whatever we needed , they were there to get it for us . <sssss> - beds . <sssss> pretty comfy beds . <sssss> - wifi - free internet . <sssss> - pools - they have 3 pools around the property . <sssss> there was one right by our room and we used it one night . <sssss> it was well maintained and stocked with towels . <sssss> open until 11pm . <sssss> bad things that i did not like about the hotel ----------- - smell . <sssss> it smelled funky . <sssss> at one time a long time ago i almost guarantee we were in a smoking room . <sssss> they try to spray air freshener type stuff to kill the smell but it was still there . <sssss> by the third day i guess we just got used to it because it was n't as bad . <sssss> - tv . <sssss> 27 inch old school zenith . <sssss> crappy selection of channels . <sssss> - old . <sssss> the place is just old . <sssss> the first night , we had someone above us and you could hear every single step they took . <sssss> the roof creaked like crazy . <sssss> thank goodness they were only there that one night or else we would have asked to change rooms . <sssss> it was like godzilla was above us . <sssss> it reminded me how bad it sucked to live in an apartment with someone above you . <sssss> this place was alright . <sssss> would i stay here again ? <sssss> probably , depending on the cost . <sssss> i loved the location ... it suited our needs extremely well . <sssss> this would be a good guys trip hotel . <sssss> a romantic getaway with your special someone ? <sssss> not so much . 
3		the smells of pei wei always tempt me whether i am shopping for groceries at sprouts or when i used to work out at the hell hole called la fitness . <sssss> they have some seriously tempting aromas permeating ... i have always had lukewarm experiences at pei wei . <sssss> some better than others . <sssss> they have some standard noodle dishes . <sssss> nothing to write home about but satisfying nonetheless . <sssss> the last time i went i was excited because i saw advertised that they now sell lettuce wraps . <sssss> i was thinking if they are anything like the more upscale and much tastier brother restaurant pf changs lettuce wraps then i was in for a treat . <sssss> but ... no vegetarian lettuce wraps . <sssss> boo ! <sssss> hiss ! <sssss> just chicken and beef . <sssss> how easy would it be to chop up some tofu , give it the same basic seasoning , and serve it up with some iceberg ? <sssss> sigh . <sssss> i noticed they have a coconut curry dish . <sssss> hmmm ... i like coconut curry . <sssss> should be good , right ? <sssss> big mistake vegegirly . <sssss> i should know better . <sssss> i am spoiled by authentic hole in the wall thai restaurants nearby me . <sssss> so i order up coconut curry with tofu and veggies with noodles instead of rice . <sssss> bland . <sssss> bland . <sssss> bland . <sssss> yes it has a bit of a dull spicy kick to it . <sssss> but it lacks the depth of flavor that a good coconut curry should have . <sssss> noodles had an unpleasant texture . <sssss> i tasted some noodles from my husbands chicken teriyaki . <sssss> good flavor . <sssss> should have gotten that . <sssss> bottom line ? <sssss> stick to the basics if you are ordering food here . 
3		not too many sushi choices in the area . <sssss> visited a month ago . <sssss> place was kinda busy , but our rolls came out pretty quick . <sssss> everything was fresh and overall service was good . <sssss> i would give it another chance . 
3		ugghhhhh breakfast club - why did you change the most homey , comforting , warm breakfast spots in the phoenix area ??? <sssss> `` why '' grandiose visions - now it ' cold and corporate ! <sssss> the locals are just programmed - sheep ! <sssss> i loved you so 8 months ago before you sold out ! <sssss> at least your coffee is still the bomb ! <sssss> you just went off my top ten list . <sssss> what the hell do i even need to visit scottsdale anymore for ; -lrb- 
3		we were staying across the street and wanted some sushi . <sssss> naturally i was hesitant to have sushi in a non-costal region - ignorance ? <sssss> maybe . <sssss> our plates were dirty . <sssss> it was quickly remedied by the waitress but still - gross . <sssss> the fish was was not fresh . <sssss> although they did have uni , my favorite , it tasted gross . <sssss> the sushi was extremely expensive - most likely to pay for shipping costs - but as stated in the beginning , sushi in the desert ? <sssss> i should 've known better . 
3		heard about this place and wanted to check it out . <sssss> walked in and was told to take a seat anywhere . <sssss> was kinda limited on where to sit since a bunch of tables were not cleaned and had dishes still sitting on the tables from previous patrons . <sssss> so we sat down at a clean table and waited to be greeted ... and waited ... finally about 10 minutes or so someone finally came by to take our drink order . <sssss> it was definitely not busy . <sssss> so we got a couple beers-some good beers on tap . <sssss> got the bruschetta and was very disappointed . <sssss> i think i could make it better at my own home , but i knew they were known for there pizza so i went onto the next . <sssss> got a basic margarita pizza and it was good . <sssss> liked that the best of my visit there . <sssss> i am a lover of ranch and they had the best ranch i 've ever had . <sssss> over all i was not super impressed by my humble pie experience and will try other places instead of this . <sssss> maybe come back in a few months to try again . 
3		i have grown up using and wearing cabela 's products and have appreciate the quality of their goods . <sssss> the thing that i appreciate about cabela 's is that they actually sell thinks that outdoors oriented people need . <sssss> you will go to some sporting goods stores and you will be able to buy tents and coats and there would be very few items for hunting . <sssss> cabela 's has a huge inventory that you are able to choose from . <sssss> on the website users are great about reviewing products so you know how it is going to perform in the real world applications . <sssss> the greatest part is the return policy . <sssss> if you break something that you buy they seem to just replace it ! <sssss> i have never had a problem getting a problem satisfied by them . <sssss> the store is amazing to visit , there are fish and game mounts and awesome exhibits to take a look at . <sssss> it was a great date idea before i got married just because there was so much to look at . <sssss> complaints ? <sssss> i went to a cardinals game this weekend and stopped here first to buy some ammo and ar15 parts . <sssss> i spend close to 100 bucks at the store and they would still not permit me to park there for the game . <sssss> it is a small thing but it was frustrating . 
3		this place was just ok ... the breakfast was 27 bucks for 2 people and tasted the same as what most hilton hotels serve for free . <sssss> the rooms were small but clean , the bathrooms were outdated and did n't have the nice counter tops like most hiltons/hamptons have . <sssss> the location was kind of hidden and most cab drivers did n't know where it was located but overall it was located in a great spot since it was in the middle of old downtown scottsdale . 
3		staff is okay . <sssss> they have a lot of conversations on the sales floor that should n't be held in front of customers . <sssss> prices and sales are really good . 
3		the food here is really tasty and the location is nice . <sssss> the only thing that kept me from giving it a 5 star review was the really lackluster service i received from my server 
3		this place has all the variables to be a hit . <sssss> they have been open for about a year now and i have come here on and off for that amount of time . <sssss> the best thing they have going for them is great coffee consistency . <sssss> my toddy and americanos have been good every time . <sssss> i would go as far to say they serve lux coffee better then lux does . <sssss> however the pastries have been hit or miss . <sssss> i think the key is to come in early when they are fresh out of the oven . <sssss> every time i have come in -lrb- once a month or so -rrb- i swear there is a whole new set of employees . <sssss> this does n't effect the coffee quality and customer service -lrb- surprisingly -rrb- as much as the food . <sssss> i would think after a year the kinks of running a shop would be worked out and you would retain your team but not the case here . <sssss> but this is why carmel 's get 3 stars , they raised the prices and the food is not good enough to warrant the price hike . <sssss> their original prices along with great customer service and coffee consistency is what kept me coming in . <sssss> this has changed though . <sssss> granted , the coffee is still good and ultimately that 's most important but i am not going to go out of my way to drop by . 
3		tried thirsty lion for the first time with a work group . <sssss> started rather rough as we got there before the dinner rush -lrb- 4:30 -rrb- and asked for a table for eight of us . <sssss> they said it would be a few minutes . <sssss> there were six people in the whole place ! <sssss> we waited 15 minutes before being seated -lrb- by the time we left at 7 , it was only 1/4 full -rrb- . <sssss> tl seems to be going thru an identity crisis : are they a sports bar , an irish pub or something else ? <sssss> beer selection was ample , along with 4 seasonal beers . <sssss> got my fave : kilt lifter . <sssss> ordered several apps , with mixed reviews : the soft pretzel was good but the cheese sauce was nasty . <sssss> what did they put in it ? <sssss> the crab cakes were small , heavily breaded with little flavor . <sssss> the calamari was liked by some and not others . <sssss> i found them bland . <sssss> the pub chip nachos were a big hit and we ended up with three plates of them ! <sssss> our entrees came , which were mostly burgers , since reviewers said to stick with those . <sssss> one brave soul tried the kung pao chicken and said it was very good with good spice level . <sssss> another got beef tenderloin tips and was pleased , but not with the $ 17.95 price tag . <sssss> service was adequate but for a party of eight on a slow night , i expect better than adequate . 
3		i go to watch grounded and fred green there . <sssss> drinks are decent and cold . <sssss> one of those places you ca n't believe there 's a cover charge . <sssss> like mandi said , slumming without the risk . 
3		here 's the story , of some chinese chicken ... served with different styles of rice ... all of them had different sauces , the lightest one not very spicy . <sssss> here 's the story , of beans and burritos ... some black beans , others refried . <sssss> both of them were very tasty , but also guaranteed to keep you on the pot all night . <sssss> so , this one day when the chicken met the beans and burritos ... they knew that it was much more than a hunch ... that this group should somehow join together , and that 's the way they all became my greasy lunch . <sssss> while i was developing this article i tried to categorize chino bandido . <sssss> i went back and forth between mexican and chinese over ten times before i just put it under both categories . <sssss> however , chino really is n't chinese , mexican , or chinese-mexican fusion ; it 's really its own type of food . <sssss> speaking of fusion , what the hell is that ? <sssss> the only fusion that comes out of chino bandido is the mix of ethnic food in your stomach that will prohibit you from any sort of activity while it 's digesting . <sssss> anyway , let 's get into it . <sssss> chino is nothing fancy . <sssss> it 's discreetly hidden behind a walgreens off the main road . <sssss> when you walk in you will notice that it is furnished with costco folding tables and chairs , exposed duct work , concrete floor , and very little decoration on the walls except for an autographed guy fieri poster in the back . <sssss> it 's pretty simple . <sssss> gentleman , a word to the wise : do n't expect to get laid if you bring a lady here on a first date . <sssss> as usual , i checked out chino 's menu on their website before i left the house . <sssss> i 'm no rocket scientist , but you need a quantum physics degree to figure out their ordering system . <sssss> however , chino has attempted to make ordering a bit easier by implementing ordering instructions and a simulator on their website . <sssss> the staff at chino 's is awesome and will guide you through the ordering process and let you sample everything on the menu first anyway . <sssss> if you read my previous post on costco samples , you know that chino giving samples wins hearts and minds in my book . <sssss> my first time at chino i tried the jade red chicken , the bbq pork in a burrito , refried beans , and jerk fried rice . <sssss> the jade red chicken was decent . <sssss> it was like a general tso 's chicken on steroids . <sssss> a fried texture ; super spicy and super sweet . <sssss> the bbq pork was alright but a little bland . <sssss> while reading yelp i remember running across someone 's yelp review that stated he loved the jade red chicken so much that he was pissed off that the bbq pork had to share the plate with it . <sssss> uh yeah , it did n't bother me that much . <sssss> the jerk fried rice was pretty good as well ... it included jerk chicken and green onions . <sssss> chino 's gets props for originality , giving you a lot of food , and making it easy to take home the leftovers . <sssss> once you slap on the cardboard lid you are all set to take it home and have it for breakfast the next day . <sssss> the best part about chino bandido -lrb- and best value -rrb- is the bonus they give you ; the snickerdoodle or chocolate volcano cookie -lrb- baked during weekends -rrb- . <sssss> i opted for the chocolate volcano cookie and let me just say that thing was damn good . <sssss> i will admit that the food was probably not enough to bring me back to chino bandido that often , but that cookie just might make it happen . <sssss> and as for fusion , maybe next week i will try some korean-ethiopian-chilean mix . <sssss> you just never know . 
3		market ... not exactly ... farmer 's market ... absolutely not . <sssss> think craft fair , with a band , better than average nosh items , like a great sausage and peppers hoagie , excellent mexican drinks , overpriced but tasty breads and pastries . <sssss> so , if you are looking for a great way to kill a saturday morning and you are low on tie die pot holders and baby t-shirts , need some overpriced kalamata olive bread and want a snack while listening to a great band in downtown phoenix , this is your spot . <sssss> if you are truly interested in shopping local and looking for local produce - you are in phoenix , let go of this dream and head to sprouts ! 
3		the original flavor is good and the texture is not too creamy but not too icy . <sssss> the toppings selection could be better . 
3		3 and a half stars . <sssss> the shack serves up some pretty good tasting meat . <sssss> i thought the sauce consistency and flavor were top notch . <sssss> smoky , slightly spicy-slightly sweet . <sssss> the tiny seedless bun it was piled onto just could n't stand up to it , though , and nearly disintigrated . <sssss> this is n't a problem when you 're dining in full service , but having it handed to you on not even a paper plate , just a few sheets of wax paper , made it difficult to enjoy as much as i otherwise would have . <sssss> service here was pretty friendly , and i 'll try it again to get a taste of the interesting bbq tacos i saw another patron eating . 
3		it 's fun . <sssss> the food is really heavy and it serves an empty stomach just right . <sssss> it 's kuntry all the way . <sssss> kuntry krunk . <sssss> i feel like such a yuppie/cappucino cowboy eating in here , but you always enjoy it ! 
3		this place is pretty interesting . <sssss> its a little hard to find if you 've never been there before , its in a little strip mall nudged right into the corner by a print shop and a skate shop if i remember right . <sssss> the decor is actually pretty cool and trippy . <sssss> one wall is all yellow with a gigantic paragraph/quote of text on black that takes up that whole section and there are some cool paintings decorating it . <sssss> it has this kitschy meets hippie vibe . <sssss> countr people were nice . <sssss> i had mock chicken with noodles and you get served in the slanted ceramic bowls they have at mongolian bbqs like genghis grill . <sssss> i had the mock chicken and noodles and if i didnt know better , id swear it was pretty close to the real thing , the portions were pretty huge i didnt finish mine , but it was pretty cool to check out at least once , though i had kind of wished id ordered the vegan chili fries when all was said and done . 
3		great excuse to dress up . <sssss> high quality professional theatre productions with dinner . 
3		garlic naan is the best . <sssss> food is quite good . 
3		the concept is great , basically a design your own sushi roll . <sssss> there are a lot of options , and the prices are relatively friendly . <sssss> if you want to add a lot in your roll , that 's when the price of the roll can get high . <sssss> however , all the ingredients are extremely fresh and the size of the roll itself is suitable for a light meal ! <sssss> i had a brown rice seaweed roll with salmon , asparagus , mango , and cucumber . <sssss> the sesame seeds on top added the crunch that i like , and the fresh ingredients made for a delicious combination . <sssss> it 's definitely not authentic or extremely high quality , but it 's satisfactory and balanced . <sssss> after sampling my familys ' rolls , i found that the tuna is also very fresh . <sssss> they also have a large variety of sauces and toppings so you can really customize the flavor and texture of the roll that you want ! 
3		once one of my favorite , most amazing places , now a trip to lee 's typically ends with a slight feeling of disappointment . <sssss> lee 's does not take debit or credit cards , and lee 's does not offer free drink refills . <sssss> worse , they serve in small cups that are packed with ice . <sssss> it 's kind of insulting . <sssss> the bread for the sandwiches * is * fantastic . <sssss> the amount of meat used in the banh mi could be better . <sssss> i always order extra meat ... 3 years ago , it was noticeable . <sssss> these days , it almost seems like you get less meat if you pay for extra ! <sssss> d : of course the roast pork banh mi is tasty tasty , but give the european sandwiches -lrb- croissants -rrb- a whirl too ! <sssss> i especially love the roast beef ! <sssss> also , big flatscreens playing fox news is kind of difficult to look at while dining ... this should be a 2 star review , because of that ! <sssss> : p 
3		okay i must admit i now have tried sabai about 4 times and it actually seems like it has gotten better . <sssss> i have n't tried anything beside the crab wontons and pad thai . <sssss> the food has become consistent which i think is the hardest thing for a restaurant to do . <sssss> i still stand buy that it is overpriced though . <sssss> but given the other choices and not wanting to drive to tempe it will suffice . <sssss> i am willing to move from a 1 star to 3 . 
3		yay ! <sssss> they have spam !!!!! <sssss> i was going to go for meat plate # 4 but when i saw the grilled spam with eggs , i was in love . <sssss> i do n't care what you spam-haters have to say . <sssss> i 'm asian through and through and will stick to my spam . <sssss> mmmm . <sssss> . <sssss> sooo salty and meat-like . <sssss> it was just what i expected , spam , fried eggs and rice with some macaroni salad . <sssss> it was good . <sssss> reminded me of the days when my parents did n't cook and we would fry up some spam to eat with white rice and soy sauce . <sssss> my friends were kinda ` eh ' about their dishes . <sssss> it also took a long time for the food to come out for them too . <sssss> one cool thing about this place was that the phoenix fire department eats here ... so hot ! <sssss> too bad i was busy stuffing my face with spam and eggs . <sssss> that was probably not hot . 
3		this place was cool . <sssss> the exhibits were great the kids play area was awesome . <sssss> we just wish the people greeting us and selling us our tickets were nice . <sssss> they were down right rude . <sssss> they seemed annoyed with us before we even finished paying . <sssss> maybe because we redeemed a groupon ? <sssss> not sure but it really made of upset . <sssss> the kids had fun and we enjoyed all the old vintage fire truck 
3		the dilemma : feed 10 of sally struthers ' children for a month or go to the movies and snack bar . <sssss> movies won this time . <sssss> my first experience with this theater led me back to amc . <sssss> overcrowded and overrun with children of all ages . <sssss> that 's all it takes for me . <sssss> however , we decided to take in a movie yesterday evening -lrb- sunday -rrb- after the mall had closed . <sssss> far less crowded and an all-around more pleasant experience , thankfully , as my cheap ass does not like to pay $ 9.50 for a movie to begin with . <sssss> i was mildly irritated that when i ordered a small -lrb- child size -rrb- popcorn , the concession idiot tried to up sell me to a large with a free refill . <sssss> now either i ordered a small because i do n't think $ 6.25 for popcorn is reasonable or i ordered a small because i do n't want a 55-gallon drum of it to begin with . <sssss> anyhow , it was over salted and i made the mistake of asking for `` butter . '' <sssss> that would be some oily substance that the popcorn was bathed in . <sssss> i 'll come here again when the mall is closed or when gas reaches $ 17.85 a gallon , but much prefer amc esplanade just down the road . 
3		if you are one of those `` love city life '' people then this is the place for you . <sssss> the modern hipster decor and lounge house music is a little redundant since a lot of places in downtown phoenix look and sound the same . <sssss> the portions are nice and food was tasty for the price . <sssss> the waitress seemed less than enthusiastic with her service after we declined to have drinks with our meal . 
3		i love mac n ' cheese & i love the dark . <sssss> these 2 facts make me like this place . <sssss> the service was good . <sssss> the prices were reasonable . <sssss> they had a decent selection of craft beer & local wine . <sssss> the dark colors and candles were comforting . <sssss> -lrb- however this atmosphere makes the headlights from the cars parking up against the windows somewhat more obtrusive -rrb- a solid 3 stars for me . <sssss> . <sssss> i was n't blown away , but i was n't disappointed ... p.s. i think maybe i 'll miss lisa g 's . <sssss> . <sssss> ?! 
3		yep ... still gets three stars . <sssss> the yellowtail sashimi was a bit dry and the salmon skin roll was way chewy . <sssss> but the flavors were good . <sssss> looks like they 've done away with lunch specials . <sssss> but from all the bud signs and specials , you 'd think it was a bar . <sssss> too expensive for the food quality ! 
3		meh . <sssss> decent . <sssss> mexican food on fried bread , if you can picture that . <sssss> still , it was good , and reasonably priced . 
3		really liked the look and feel , but service was pretty slow even though we were being served by the owner . <sssss> the food was just okay , nothing special . <sssss> maybe would consider trying it again , but for the price i could go somewhere better . 
3		went there for a company team build . <sssss> the have a decent bar selection . <sssss> lanes are nice . <sssss> staff was friendly . <sssss> good for getting your bowl on . 
3		i 've been to windsor enough now to `` get it '' and to have let them address some of the observations of other customers . <sssss> i 'll start off by saying that there is nothing fatally flawed in the place , and the concept is quite good . <sssss> combined with churn and demarco 's i consider it a hipster urbanist interpretation of a shopping mall food court for the 30-50 demographic . <sssss> everything in it speaks in some way to those who were in high school or college in the mid-eighties through mid-nineties . <sssss> let me take a moment to gloat : my brothers and sisters ! <sssss> we are in the rich part of the nostalgia curve now ! <sssss> enjoy ! <sssss> anyway , the concept and decor is great and just works . <sssss> what 's wrong ? <sssss> well , the food . <sssss> everything i have ordered off the appetizer menu is either too salty or not quite there in some way . <sssss> portion was too small or was over/underdone . <sssss> i do n't mind the fact that they do n't really have any happy hour specials to excite and entice , but if there 's no discount to convince me that i am somehow getting a deal , the food better be terrific . <sssss> and it is n't . <sssss> the groups i 've been with have left half portions of small plates that should have been wiped clean . <sssss> what else ? <sssss> the service was noticeably slow and a bit cold each time i was there . <sssss> yes , i get it : you 're young , attractive and hip and are probably working on a screenplay that will sensitize all of us to the ecological plight of the pygmy eskimo wombat , and working this mind-numblingly-dull waiter job is such a condescension . <sssss> just bring me a beer . <sssss> also , the music is too loud . <sssss> i did n't like most of that stuff the first time around , but i 'll indulge it for nostalgia 's sake . <sssss> anyway , not bad but not quite a destination . <sssss> needs some work . 
3		okay , my husband and i went there to celebrate our anniversary tonight since yelp gave them 4 stars . <sssss> we probably wo n't dine there again , their miso soup tasted strange , they probably used chicken stock instead of bonito -lrb- dashi -rrb- , i was very disappointed . <sssss> sushi was okay but i want more sushi vinegar . <sssss> my huband did n't like their rice , tonkatsu was okay but too thin . <sssss> since i 'm japanese and moved from sf bay area , i could be a picky food critic . <sssss> i went to tomo , kabuki in glendale , akai hana and here , unfortunately they are about same . <sssss> with this economy all the restaurants are trying to survive , but we need good japanese restaurants in west side of phoenix . <sssss> i just found better , cheaper and fresh sushi in fry 's supermarket in goodyear . <sssss> it worth to try and you do n't have to pay tip . <sssss> lol 
3		what ? <sssss> the sushi comes around on a conveyor belt ? <sssss> what ?? <sssss> the sushi averages $ 2 per plate ?? <sssss> yeah , that 's what i thought too . <sssss> but this is some good sushi . <sssss> it 's fresh , and it 's tasty , and even if you 're on a budget , it beats mcdonalds every day of the week and twice on sunday . <sssss> we once fed a whole table of six for about $ 60 . <sssss> you ca n't beat that with a bat . <sssss> i ca n't say that it 's the best i 've ever had , but i go often , and i am never disappointed . <sssss> i really do n't have anything bad to say about teharu . <sssss> i 'm only giving it three stars instead of four because my damn cream puffs are always frozen . 
3		white tanks is a good veterinary practice ; however , they are very expensive . <sssss> i have taken my dogs there for a couple of years . <sssss> i appreciate the weekend hours very much . <sssss> perhaps that is why they are overpriced for some of the services . <sssss> if you do n't have a lot of extra money , be forewarned . <sssss> the vaccines and the exam fees are reasonable ; however , they charged me $ 44 to express the anal glands -lrb- $ 44 each dog !!! -rrb- <sssss> it took approximately 5 minutes of their time for each dog , i was shocked and very disappointed when i saw the charge after i got home . <sssss> no one mentioned the unusually high fee before the glands were done . <sssss> i could afford to pay it but there are people who would have a hard time , so again , be warned , ask before you agree to treatment if money is an issue for you . 
3		food was very good . <sssss> service was subpar . <sssss> the bartender seems to ignored us and was very curt and distracted . 
3		i talked my gracious date in to taking me somewhere new for dinner on friday night . <sssss> he wanted dicks , but i can be pretty convincing when food is involved . <sssss> i head read a lot about centurion on yelp , so i persuaded him this was the spot to try . <sssss> i was pleased to see we were the only people when we arrived . <sssss> i always like the special attention and choice of seating . <sssss> we chose a spot outside on the patio to take advantage of the beautiful evening and got busy with our orders . <sssss> we started with the baked clams in a berry balsamic reduction and pancetta cream sauce , it was light and scrumptious . <sssss> we also shared the three entrée dinner for two 1/2 rack lamb , 1/2 filet mignon and 1/2 poached tilapia . <sssss> they were all excellent , the filet had a smoky wood fired sear and the lamb was incredibly moist . <sssss> the entrée came with three risottos : a white truffle , a chorizo and manchego and a spicy coconut shrimp . <sssss> the flavors were great , however the risottos were extremely overdone -lrb- had i cooked those at home i would have pitched them out before serving them to my guests -rrb- . <sssss> to the chef eric 's credit , he did offer to have us back and to try the risotto on him as he claimed that is not the norm . <sssss> i will be back , the place is charming and the overall vibe very inviting , no one is perfect -lrb- risotto -rrb- but the heart and effort put in to the dish is worth a second chance . 
3		maybe my expectations were too high but other than the mellow view from the patio , i was n't overly impressed . <sssss> the place dates back to the 1930 's and was remodeled in 2009 -lrb- ?? -rrb- <sssss> the outdoor dining area has great views of camelback mountain . <sssss> the service is slow and the food was nothing to write home about . <sssss> i thought it was very overpriced as well . 
3		after spending the early part of the evening at sun devil liquors , my friend and i realized we had not yet eaten dinner . <sssss> problem was , it was a little after 10pm and nothing down the street was open - but el taco tote was ... the first experience for both of us . <sssss> we ordered the quatro tacos and the panchos . <sssss> there was a salsa bar in the middle of the room , which was n't a bad discovery . <sssss> the pico was a little peppery and had good flavor . <sssss> the panchos were okay - perhaps because it was late at night they were out of nacho cheese . <sssss> nachos without nacho cheese are not the same , but they threw some regular cheese on to replace the deficiency . <sssss> the quatro tacos were small street tacos , and they were fine . <sssss> the place was descent - especially after our time at the bar and not having dinner , but i do n't think i would choose it over filberto 's if they were side-by-side . 
3		teepee is okay . <sssss> it seems like everything on the menu comes out the same . <sssss> a ton of food -lrb- whatever it is you ordered . <sssss> . -rrb- <sssss> with a ton of sauce poured on top , with a ton of rice and beans on the side . <sssss> last time my boyfriend and i went , i ordered the chicken fajita chimi . <sssss> when it came out , i got instant heartburn just looking at this plate of food i was expected to eat -lrb- although that also might have been the result of the white wine and margaritas i had during happy hour -rrb- . <sssss> either way , it was daunting . <sssss> i could only finish about 4 bites of my burrito at the restaurant . <sssss> the good news is , teepee is one of those places where the leftovers are even better then the original . <sssss> you heat up everything at the same time , it all turns into a warm , gooey , saucy , cheesy mess and you eat bite after bite indiscriminately on your couch watching reality tv marathons . <sssss> it 's really best with reality tv marathons . 
3		it was fine , the food was a little over priced and the music was blah . <sssss> should have been a little more jazzy not so much a james taylor that had too many beers . <sssss> all n all it was alright , would ` nt go back in a hurry . 
3		decent thai but i have had better . <sssss> . <sssss> more than likely will not go back . <sssss> the service was good though so i gave it a 3 based on that aspect alone . <sssss> the pad thai was made with a weird powder instead of the usual spice and my red curry was kind of bland . <sssss> the owner however is really nice so if you want exceptional service but mediocre food , give it a try . 
3		... weaned me off baby food with rice and beans . <sssss> i 've been going to the pinata since before i could walk . <sssss> my grandparents were tight with the bougarins and we ate there often . <sssss> at some point -lrb- as my grandmother tells us every time we go -rrb- , pete confronted my mother and told her i should n't be eating that baby food , that i should be getting a proper start with an order of rice and beans . <sssss> after that , i was hooked . <sssss> for years i ordered the same thing with a roy roger -lrb- think cherry coke -rrb- . <sssss> family wedding rehearsal dinners , birthdays , out of town guests , there seemed to be no reason not to choose the pinata for good mexican food . <sssss> i used to sneak away from the table to play video games in the front corner of the cantina . <sssss> even today , it still feels like a room that i should n't be in or even curious about . <sssss> each time , our going-away treat was one of the $ 0.05 chocolate mints from the bowl on the host stand -- they are still selling the very same mints ! <sssss> this place is more nostalgic for me than anything else . <sssss> i have so many memories of so many family occasions celebrated there . <sssss> the lobby is still decorated with colorful pinatas hanging from the ceiling and walls . <sssss> mariachi music still fills the air . <sssss> and the blender can still be heard in the distance , chopping fresh ice for the next margarita . <sssss> as amy already correctly identified , this is the best chips and salsa in town . <sssss> on recent visits the salsa has been watery , but it could easily have been that spoonful from the big container of it back in the kitchen . <sssss> speaking of which , above the kitchen entrance is an old 1-10 lighted number display to alert the wait staff of orders ready to be served . <sssss> i used to ask the waitress what her number was and watch for it . <sssss> -lrb- not much else to do when surrounded by adult-talk . -rrb- <sssss> if our guests were lingering types , we often ended up at the 31-flavors ice cream next door . <sssss> it lost its franchise many years ago , no doubt caught by the inspector selling generic from the price club like so many other former franchises in this old chain . <sssss> today this store is just a city signs violation , like something out of tijuana . <sssss> but back to the pinata . <sssss> it 's one of the valley originals . <sssss> if you have n't done it , and you think you are a phoenician , you are n't one yet . 
3		a different way to have fun with your friends aside from the bar and club scene . <sssss> there is an arcade , and it is attached to a bar so you have a lot of options . 
3		there is a price list on the pumps for cash or credit card prices but tried to use my card twice there and it freezes up so i had to pay cash . <sssss> there was a sloppy sticker over the old key pad that did not work but kept flapping open when i tried to use it . <sssss> probably why my card would not work . 
3		good take out . <sssss> limited wine selection . <sssss> decent chinese for anthem . <sssss> then again there is n't much to choose from . <sssss> very friendly people and my food is almost always correct for take out . 
3		it 's not the best burgers but they 're decent , but what i really like are the fries and how much you get . <sssss> . 
3		this place was cool , but not as novel as i was expecting . <sssss> a browser 's paradise for sure , there is no shortage of interesting things to see , but it 's not really some place i would go to to go shopping what with $ 100 throw pillows and other such equivalently priced/useful accoutrements . <sssss> another reviewer compared this place to our unfortunately deceased jutenhoops and let me tell you it is nothing of the sort . <sssss> it 's cool to check out initially , but not really worth a trip back . 
3		we had a party of 7 on wednesday night to celebrate 2 birthdays . <sssss> our server , michael , was very good . <sssss> the 7 meals , though , were just ok . <sssss> nobody said their meal was great . <sssss> i had the mongolian beef and the portion was small and the meat was like beef jerky . <sssss> i have n't been to changs in a while , but i do n't think i 'll be going back . 
3		been here a few times now . <sssss> i really love the atmosphere and customer service . <sssss> i feel totally comfortable bringing my 3 and 5 year old kids here even though it 's a brewery . <sssss> always lots of families . <sssss> the brews are always on point . <sssss> my favs are the devil ` sale and their hefe ... delicious ! <sssss> also had the seasonal mr. pineapple at their anniversary recently and that was very good too . <sssss> where they lose 2 stars for me is the food . <sssss> i 've yet to enjoy a dish i 've ordered . <sssss> it 's really disappointing . 
3		basically , this is a fancy grill in old town scottsdale . <sssss> the food four star but the prices , crowds , and awkward hostess team drops it a star . <sssss> i had the chicken and ribs - the ribs were very small , there were only two , but they were very moist and well cooked . <sssss> the honey mustard sauce was tasty but a bit overpowering . <sssss> the chicken , which is apparently their signature , was pretty run of the mill . <sssss> not sure how they did it but the skin on the chicken was n't crispy - it was soggy - which is hard to do on a rotisserie . <sssss> now , the awkward hostess and waitin time . <sssss> we arrived at 7pm for dinner and was told it would be 75 minutes . <sssss> normally a non-starter but we walked the town and it was fine . <sssss> a friend of ours decided to join us so we notified the restaurant and they said that adding another person would push the wait to 2.5 hours becuase there are a limited number of tables for 6 . <sssss> gulp . <sssss> i explained that two in our party are children -lrb- aged 2 and 4 -rrb- and did n't need a full seat . <sssss> that seemed to really confuse the hostess ... she reminded me a few times that the wait is 2.5 hours and that we 'd still need a party of 6 . <sssss> even though they 're tiny , would likely be sleeping in the stroller anyway , and the booth style seating meant there 'd be plenty of space if we needed it.after speaking to a manager i convinced them to let us take a table for 5 and all was saved . <sssss> but let 's just say that the hostesses should work on being less awkward and more flexible . 
3		i have been a customer of lee-lee 's from the very start , maybe like 20 years . <sssss> i was perhaps customer # 5 when he and his wife opened their first small store on the nw corner of dobson and southern , and their store was maybe 600 square feet max , and he personally had to drive his panel truck to la to buy goods every week . <sssss> i went there today to get some ingredients for my chinese food menu that i was preparing tonight . <sssss> but a couple of things really irked me so i felt i had to write this review . <sssss> first of all , i wanted so pork shoulder that needed to be larger than what they had in the prepackaged meat section . <sssss> i also saw some salmon and i wanted to know what kind of salmon that was -- farm raised or wild ? <sssss> and what species -- red ? <sssss> silver ? <sssss> i knew it could n't be pink salmon from the color and it could n't be king from the price . <sssss> but nobody in the fish section could answer my question . <sssss> and nobody in the meat section would go cut me a piece of pork in the size i wanted . <sssss> then i felt the urge to go use the restroom . <sssss> but when i got there , someone was cleaning the restroom and i asked if i could use it . <sssss> i was told , no , i just had to wait . <sssss> ever have to `` go '' and there was nowhere to `` go '' ? <sssss> i was so angry i felt like `` going '' on the floor in the hallway there . <sssss> wtf ??? <sssss> my point in writing this post is that lee-lee was great with customer service when the owner and his wife ran the place . <sssss> then his wife became a stay-at-home mom and that was ok since he was still there to assist , help , and answer questions . <sssss> but now he is really big and has two stores . <sssss> he also spends 80 + % of his time at the the nw store and seldom is at the chandler store . <sssss> his customer service is going downhill fast -- every year i get more and more irritated along with others i spoke with . <sssss> guess we got ta shift all our business to mekong plaza up the road . <sssss> too bad , i used to like lee-lee but i guess loyalty means nothing these days . <sssss> and customer service is a thing of the past . 
3		this is the type of restaurant you only go to once . <sssss> i have now been there twice - once at the old location , once at the new one . <sssss> the reason you only go there once ? <sssss> holy wait time , batman . <sssss> i 'm sorry , but there has to be a way to make the seating more efficient . <sssss> when you 're hungry , there 's nothing worse than 30-60 minute wait times , or a giant party of 15 people who arrive later than you do and they get to `` squeeze in '' . <sssss> although matt 's has just upgraded to a new , bigger space , this still is n't the type of restaurant that should be accommodating 15-person groups -lrb- aka almost the entire dining area -rrb- . <sssss> we went here for my husband 's birthday on a friday morning . <sssss> after waiting about 45 minutes , we were next on the list but got bumped to the uncomfortable street-facing counter seats , when at that very moment there were three empty two-top tables , completely set with silverware and everything . <sssss> we asked if we could be seated there instead , but were turned down by the host , because they were being reserved for the aforementioned party . <sssss> my husband was having trouble with knee pain that morning and the counter seats did not physically accommodate his needs , so we asked our waitress if there was anywhere else we could sit . <sssss> again , we were turned down . <sssss> i was getting a little flustered , not the way you want to feel on your loved one 's birthday . <sssss> we considered leaving , even after we ordered our food . <sssss> eventually , they did allow us to sit at a two-top , which i appreciated . <sssss> the food was the only redeeming quality , but again i was too flustered to truly enjoy it . <sssss> i got the cheese omelette with hash browns . <sssss> very good , although hash browns were a greasy , mushy mess . <sssss> my husband got a ham scramble of some kind . <sssss> we had a side of rye toast , which was tasty . <sssss> beverages were served in cute little jam jars . <sssss> pros : food , decor , charm , ambience , supporting a local endeavor cons : the most hyper-inflated wait time and some of the worst seating options of any restaurant i 've ever known . <sssss> the take-out option sounds nice , and would eliminate a lot of my frustrations . 
3		i am not really sure where to start off , but , i 'll start by saying that every time i have gone to green ; the service as been right on par . <sssss> however , i am not inclined to absolutely rave about how great their vegan cuisine is . <sssss> to begin , i think they 're salads and some of their appetizers and sandwiches are crisp and fresh and delicious . <sssss> some of the pastas and other items that require any oil or things of that nature , seem to be drenched in it . <sssss> it 's busy a lot , which excites me because it makes me think there is a more prevalent health conscious or environmentally friendly population out there . <sssss> wrapping this little blurb up ; this restaurant might eliminate any notions some people have who firmly believe in the stigma that all vegetarian/vegan friendly food tastes like cardboard . <sssss> notions like that are probably crushed there by any noob who walks through those doors and that in itself is a worthy accomplishment ! 
3		the lettuce wraps alone would be a 10 star review . <sssss> unfortunately when it comes to pei wei , i 've yet to really have anything else at any location that 's blown me away . <sssss> wei pei is about as standard as americanized asian food gets . <sssss> it 's just prepared here in quicker manner than full service chain restaurants , and usually in a better manner than fast food asian restaurants . <sssss> i went because my girlfriend had a craving for the lettuce wraps . <sssss> while a few better places have similar wraps to pei wei and pf chang 's , i 'll give these two chains credit for having the best . <sssss> we jokingly said before ordering our meal that we should just have gone with two orders of the wraps . <sssss> ironically enough , we were right . <sssss> we also order chicken lo mein . <sssss> when i took the first taste , i was shocked to taste pretty much nothing . <sssss> when my girlfriend took a bite , she realized it was sauceless . <sssss> she then asked one of the `` servers '' -lrb- i do n't know a better term for guy who brings food you ordered from counter to table and cleans off plates but did n't take your order -rrb- for some . <sssss> we tossed it into the noodles and it made a big difference , but it still was a rather plain and boring version of a popular chinese dish . 
3		saw the studio movie grill groupon offer for $ 5 per movie ticket -lrb- with free soda -rrb- and could n't pass on the opportunity . <sssss> i bought a bunch and used a few on sunday to see the 11:15 am showing of the bourne legacy . <sssss> the staff consists mainly of young adults , and all were very professional . <sssss> the ticketing area is off to the left once you enter . <sssss> the ticket agent is apparently used to accepting groupons . <sssss> she redeemed the groupon codes off my phone , handed us our movie tickets , drink tickets , and the extensive menu . <sssss> off to the right of the ticketing area is the lobby - clean , open , and bright . <sssss> right behind the ticketing area is the bar . <sssss> we entered theater # 4 close to 30mins before showing and that did n't seem to be a problem . <sssss> since it was early and we planned on having lunch after the movie , we decided on a couple of `` snacks '' . <sssss> i pushed the red button -lrb- available with each seat -rrb- and within five minutes , the server came by . <sssss> the free drink tickets are applied towards non-alcoholic beverages only -lrb- i.e. , soft drinks , iced tea , strawberry lemonade , and coffee -rrb- . <sssss> our drinks arrived within five minutes and the food ten minutes after that . <sssss> the sweet potato fries and molten chocolate cake were warm -lrb- not hot -rrb- , but both were good -lrb- the cake comes with vanilla ice cream -rrb- . <sssss> the serving size of the cake is a bit lacking , so if you 're hungry and craving dessert , each person better order their own - just sayin ' . <sssss> during our time there , we were served by four individuals - one that took our order , one that delivered our drinks , one that dropped off/picked up the bill , and one that took away the silverware/dishes -lrb- real , not paper or plastic ! -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> although staff was busy coming in and out of the theater during the length of the movie , they were unobtrusive and did n't detract from the movie/dining experience . <sssss> tip - include the drink tickets once you have the bill and the server will deduct the price of the non-alcoholic drinks off your bill . <sssss> the lot was pretty empty when we got there but by the time we left , it was almost full and there were lines forming for some of the showings . <sssss> to avoid the rush for good seats , i think i 'm going to avoid movies during opening weekend . <sssss> overall , we enjoyed our time at studio movie grill and will be going back next week ! <sssss> -lrb- see pics to get an idea of the layout and menu items . -rrb- <sssss> i 've been to three movie/dining places in az - ipic , ultrastar cinemas and smg . <sssss> my fave so far is smg ; it 's classy but a bit more intimate . <sssss> there are a few restaurants outside of the theater if you do n't feel like ordering off smg 's menu . <sssss> we ended up having lunch at narai thai & sushi . 
3		we have always enjoyed dining at on the border , the last couple of times the service has been a little slow . <sssss> the food was not up to it 's usual standards . <sssss> the bar area is fun ! <sssss> the tvs make the time go by while waiting for the food . <sssss> overall , because we use to be a regular we will go back again and see how it goes . 
3		not bad , the atmosphere is jeopardized because if feels like you are in a retail shop more than a restaurant . <sssss> the chef 's talent come out with the very well plated dishes . <sssss> this location is worth the time to stop by for a bite to eat , i hope to see the restaurant gain its creditability and grown into something really nice . <sssss> the creativity of the food will one day out grow their current location . 
3		i was riding the light rail home , in the mood for chinese for lunch , so i got off @ 44th st , and walked up to the cofco center , assuming -lrb- rightly -rrb- that there would be some restaurants in there . <sssss> went to lao ching hing . <sssss> nice decor . <sssss> ordered the combo chow mein . <sssss> it was ok , nothing spectacular . <sssss> the unusual thing was the noodles were smaller than what i am used to in chow mein . <sssss> it was more like spaghetini rather than spaghetti . 
3		i came here last night after craving carne asada all day . <sssss> so i hopped on over here after work and almost missed it because it 's tucked away and it 's super small . <sssss> the burrito did not disappoint . <sssss> carne asada was perfectly seasoned , tortilla warm and slightly toasted , guacamole and pico de gallo with just enough kick ... i admit that i 'm drooling just a little bit right now as a write this . <sssss> if it came with a little rice inside i would have given this place 4 stars . 
3		like beer ? <sssss> drink here . <sssss> for anyone i know reading this , i 've been clean and sober since 1981 . <sssss> i ended up in the bikini as i scouted the luster kaboom self-portrait around the corner on the trunk space wall . <sssss> http://www.panoramio.com/user/4447772?comment_page=1&photo_page=2 the more i looked , the more interesting graphics and art i found and chased on this corner of the old main highway to wickenburg . <sssss> a friendly guy named doug asked what i was doing . <sssss> in a minute he had me inside to take pictures of the bikini art . <sssss> lots of tikis , sculpture and two paintings of women just as captain james cook found them on his first voyage . <sssss> i found nemo glowing bright in a dark corner under the palm leaf and bamboo overhang . <sssss> there 's other art too , some for sale . <sssss> it 's s neighborhood bar flavored south pacific . <sssss> tuesday night is dj night and apparently rocks . <sssss> there 's a single pool table , a long bar , and lots of seating scattered across the main floor . <sssss> bikini washed waves of snug saloon memories to my frontal lobes . <sssss> at least what little i can recall . <sssss> i had an innocent , drunken , blast during my many hours , days and nights in that dim , smoky , peanut shell strewn room , with its 19th century bar , keg and cable spool seating , harley tranny cover and other items hanging from the ceiling . <sssss> the snug . <sssss> lest you think i got no class , i 've rented beer from posh bars in cities like san francisco , new york and crescent cities too . <sssss> sandy runs the place . <sssss> apparently the city of the sun is planning some extensive urban renewal , with the mid town grand avenue corridor in its sights . <sssss> i do not understand how the city demands its past be torn down , crushed and piled east of town lake . <sssss> while the urban central corridor could use a transfusion , there may be fresh plans for a new grand . <sssss> club bikini has faced its share of renovation demands and is way spruced up from a few years ago . <sssss> i know , i am unaware of city or real estate politics , sign and zoning ordinances and requirements for proper plumbing , lighting and fire sprinklers . <sssss> a micro brew , swing dance club , student housing , market with veggies , mini library , mini micro business school and micro bank plus people enjoying the area on more days than one friday a month . <sssss> of course , our state population concentrations firmly support and encourage exsanguination to former class 1 ag lands , big box dollars moving to corporate hq , and other major shopping swept away from town on the green tide . <sssss> there are some very interesting buildings on south grand with architecture and character . <sssss> the bikini 's a real character . <sssss> visit it before the tikis and polynesians make their last voyage . <sssss> or stand up for the area , a little more urban concentration , less time on video games and in home theaters . 
3		note : i came here on business , not pleasure , so i did n't get to use all the pools / waterpark , etc. . <sssss> half of the front desk / lobby staff -lrb- night shift -rrb- was super friendly and accommodating , the other half -lrb- morning -rrb- was borderline rude . <sssss> the rooms were sort of a weird layout - almost motel style , where they all opened directly to an outdoor hallway , with a pool on the inside courtyard - leading to some noise . <sssss> the room layouts were awkward : a sitting room , then a bathroom in the hallway -lrb- sectioned off - a door for the toilet/shower , and a pocket door to the bedroom - too many doors , in my opinion -rrb- , then on the other side of the bathroom/hallway , was the bedroom . <sssss> i really did n't like this layout , as i prefer a more open layout . <sssss> also , there was no wifi - only a lan chord - in the sitting room , not the bedroom , where i prefer to use my laptop . <sssss> -lrb- i was able to move the lan chord connector to the bedroom , but a bit of a nuissance . -rrb- <sssss> most importantly , my breakfast certificates -lrb- for being a gold member -rrb- did n't fully cover the breakfast buffet , and i had to fork over an additional $ 6.50 for my breakfast on top of my certificate . <sssss> tacky . <sssss> very tacky . <sssss> especially when i can get a made-to-order omellete at the hilton garden inn north scottsdale on princess - all covered by my certificate . 
3		some of the dishes are good but others are better . <sssss> this place needs a remodel and more organization . <sssss> they have a strange way of ordering your food . <sssss> i wo n't be back ! <sssss> i have had much better ! 
3		i reaaaaaaaally want to give this place at least 4 stars but i ca n't . <sssss> i 've been here many times now and give it 4-5 stars for ambiance , music -lrb- love tommy ! -rrb- <sssss> , outdoor patio , the view -lrb- no pun intended -rrb- , and the food -lrb- delish !! <sssss> i 've never had a meal here that was less than superb ! -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> i wish i could say the same for the service . <sssss> as you can deduce from the numerous reviews , this aspect of the restaurant requires some major tlc . <sssss> bottom line : they are understaffed and need better leadership from the management . <sssss> the owner seems stressed out all the time , although the servers are very friendly and sweet . <sssss> why do i keep coming back ? <sssss> it 's a stone 's throw from my house ... and did i mention the food ? <sssss> if you have a couple hours to kill , enjoy the company you are dining with , do n't mind waiting a little longer for outstanding food , then definitely come here ! <sssss> if you need to be attended to frequently or have high standards about service , i would not recommend this place until they beef up on staff . 
3		great atmosphere and food , but our lunch -lrb- two salads and a roasted chicken sandwich -rrb- took almost two hours . <sssss> they did n't seem to care either , i 'm just sayin . 
3		going to the tilted kilt is what you do when you are in arizona . <sssss> yes , the girls wear kilts , but the food is pretty good for a sports bar . <sssss> i did not know this location was so new . <sssss> our waitress was either having a tough night or just not with it . <sssss> i was in town for the mlb all star events and as soon as the derby ended 100s of people were in this place . <sssss> we beat the rush to a table , but the waitress had trouble with refills , mixed up our orders , and forgot to bring the check a few times . <sssss> the jalapeno burger was really good and the sweet potato fries are a must . <sssss> they are crunchy and crispy . <sssss> the kilt burner mayo from the burger made a good dip too . <sssss> my friend said his big arse burger was just okay . 
3		i get turned off when i visit a business -- a bakery -- on a friday and ask if i can order about 3 dozen cookies for monday and they answer with a : `` no we ca n't . '' <sssss> * crickets * wtf ? <sssss> are n't you a bakery or is this a front ? <sssss> and then it hit me , this bakery only makes cakes and cupcakes . <sssss> cookies are not in their repertoire . <sssss> however , i ask myself , `` then why do you sell cookies ? '' <sssss> it 's clear that this is only a cupcake/cake store . <sssss> that 's all they make in the premises . <sssss> they do sell other baked goods , too , like cookies and macaroons and rice krispies treats and caramel popcorn but clearly , these products are ordered elsewhere . <sssss> then why did n't the staffer explain that . <sssss> instead , i was met with the `` no , stupid '' look . <sssss> anyway ... i have ordered dozens of cupcakes here ... dozens ! <sssss> not for me but for my clients ' clients . <sssss> never really tasted any of them until this unfortunate friday . <sssss> of course , i ordered my favorite , red velvet cupcake . <sssss> my companion -- an espresso cupcake . <sssss> i must say that the espresso cupcake was very good . <sssss> the taste of espresso can definitely be tasted and the moistness of the cupcake was up to par . <sssss> espresso-infused buttercream frosting topped this creation , which made the espresso cupcake creation true to its flavor . <sssss> the red velvet cake , however , was disappointing . <sssss> in all seriousness , it was just some bland tasting white cake that was given some red food coloring ... blech ! <sssss> where 's the hint of dark chocolate ? <sssss> and is that supposed to be cream cheese frosting ? <sssss> probably not . <sssss> the frosting was nothing more than buttercream , which is such a bummer . <sssss> classic red velvet needs cream cheese frosting , in my humble opinion . <sssss> as far as presentation of cakes and cupcakes goes , it is alluring and appetizing . <sssss> and this is exactly why i come here and purchase cupcakes for my client 's cllients . <sssss> the cupcakes look enticing and a feast for the eyes . <sssss> i 'm sure the other flavors of cupcakes are just fine -- good enough to give as gifts . <sssss> but the red velvet cupcake ... heck , go to fresh and easy and just buy theirs in the refrigerated section . <sssss> it 's better . 
3		did they change the restrooms ??? <sssss> why ?!!! <sssss> i do n't know if i can visit after hearing that . <sssss> those things were art . <sssss> art . <sssss> alas , i 'm sure some day i 'll wander down and check out the food . <sssss> photos make it look delicious and interesting ... so glad to to see we 're keeping the restaurant biz rolling downtown . 
3		the cheese selection leaves something to be desired . <sssss> the bakery/bread area is quite nice and usually well-stocked . <sssss> their cashiers know what they 're doing . <sssss> the lack of a real meat-department-counter is disappointing . <sssss> the store is usually neat and tidy . 
3		love it here . <sssss> i like thit nuong , the best . <sssss> the staff is slow because there are only one guy . <sssss> the other guy is the owner . <sssss> think they should hire more people . <sssss> otherwise , anything else is good . 
3		i was n't impressed with the roaring fork 's menu . <sssss> they do n't have a vegetarian entree option . <sssss> i ended up getting a side of mexican street corn -lrb- which was really well seasoned and cooked -rrb- , a side of spinach and onion , and mashed potatoes . <sssss> dinner of champions ! <sssss> everything tasted great , but i found it annoying that there was n't one entree option . <sssss> they also give you a great bread basket with out of this world corn muffins . <sssss> i gave a star just for them . <sssss> the decor of the restaurant is really nice and they have a nice patio that is heated/cooled . 
3		good bbq ... meat stands on it 's own with good smoke taste and the sauce only accents the flavor . <sssss> very clean and well laid out . <sssss> it is worth the drive just to get the hawg dawg . <sssss> what 's a hawg dawg ? <sssss> glad you asked !!! <sssss> it is a smoked sausage , stuffed with cheese , wrapped in bacon and deep fried . <sssss> topped with diced onions and our own sweet hot jalapenos . <sssss> q to u , you had me a deep fried and bacon ... i 'd be happy to bump this puppy up to 4 stars if only they had sweet tea . <sssss> i know it 's a ` southern thing ' but c'mon ! 
3		great burgers . <sssss> fast service . <sssss> not enough seating . <sssss> so what , you get free peanuts ? <sssss> cajun fries are nothing special . <sssss> absolutely no feeling of human/customer service presence . <sssss> in and out is cheaper and better ... 
3		for $ 5 , i could n't believe how dry my pastry was . <sssss> it was supposed to be nice and moist ... upon my first bite , i got the feeling that the pastry had been sitting there in the display case for at least a week . <sssss> looking at au petit four 's menu , they have quite an extensive offering from breakfast , lunch and dinner . <sssss> i thought the prices were pretty steep . <sssss> the owners were very friendly . 
3		my girlfriend and i purchased coupons for a pedicure and a gel manicure . <sssss> the shop is in a strip mall and was a little bit challenging to find . <sssss> there 's a lot of great merchandise inside - bags , shirts , jewelry but it does make it feel a bit cluttered . <sssss> this place does not have the feel of a spa experience but rather a neighborhood beauty salon . <sssss> they only have one pedi chair so the side-by-side experience of foot worship with a close friend is out . <sssss> however , they do have a nail station seated right next to the pedi chair so that you can gossip loudly . <sssss> i have no complaints about the services i received . <sssss> the pedi could have been a little more thorough but i received a hot stone massage on the calves and that was a nice touch . <sssss> my girlfriend was less satisfied with her experience . <sssss> she was unhappy with her manicure and the owner could see that she was n't happy . <sssss> to her credit , the owner took off the shellac and refunded half of the coupon price . <sssss> she handled it extremely professionally and while that should be the norm , it often is n't . <sssss> whether you 'd enjoy this salon depends on the type of experience you 're seeking . <sssss> if you 're looking for a neighborhood joint with a cheers-esque vibe , this place is for you . 
3		quick service is what they serve in the place . <sssss> they have great food ... but in my opinion just a little overpriced , but then again ... i feel like most asian restaurants are in az. . <sssss> the waiter is super friendly and always has a smile on her face . <sssss> one thing to keep in mind ... if you take any food to-go ... and they put the food in this black plastic container ... well ... even though it says it 's micro safe ... it 's not ! <sssss> mine melted in the microwave ... not cool at all ! 
3		first time trying out coffee shop . <sssss> staff was friendly , but if you do n't have extra time you will be frustrated . <sssss> it took a really long time to get tea and sandwiches . <sssss> quality was average on food . <sssss> chicken and roast beef were dry . <sssss> environment is very cute and they have free wifi if you want to just sit and have a coffee . 
3		i had not been here for about 3 years but i was in the neighborhood and went to pick up some `` plates '' for my family . <sssss> i was a little disappointed . <sssss> so i can only give them 3 stars , at best . <sssss> first of all , their meats are not as good as before . <sssss> i ordered the bbq beef and bbq pork and kalbi . <sssss> not very much and the quality of the meat was lower than what they used before . <sssss> further , they now grill the raw meat without it being marinated and then brush the marinade on the cooking meat . <sssss> consequently , the meat is not `` well soaked '' and not very tasty . <sssss> their prices are ok , but i never would have thought i would say this , but even hawaiian bbq has better prices and better quality meats and more of it . <sssss> the only think that paradise has over hawaiian is the sides -- paradise at least has korean banchan choices while hawaiian only has sauteed cabbage and veggies . 
3		big boy b-fast good , with colorful fried potatoes . <sssss> oatmeal was instant - lame . <sssss> lots of seating . <sssss> nice casual atmosphere . <sssss> lots of unhealthy sweet stuff - for a health market :-rrb- prices seemed a bit high . 
3		it 's a good burger . <sssss> they 're open late . <sssss> it 's cheap . <sssss> i 've had in-n-out a few times and it 's never been the religious experience other people seem to have at this place . <sssss> i just do n't know what i 'm missing . <sssss> i love a good burger ... trust me on that one . <sssss> in-n-out has just never floored me the way it does some people . <sssss> so , once again , in conclusion : it 's a good burger . <sssss> they 're open late . <sssss> it 's cheap . 
3		the food is good here . <sssss> imho , the pho is just a little sweeter and saltier than the vietnamese restaurant just up the street . <sssss> we ordered some fried bean curd skin supposedly stuffed with ground shrimp that were completely flavorless and small for the money . <sssss> other than that , the pho and spring rolls were tasty . <sssss> warning ! <sssss> could n't find many tofu or vegetable dishes . <sssss> the other place is still my hands down favorite . <sssss> sorry ! 
3		8/11 after visiting cerreta 's candy factory , i thought i 'd knock another eatery off my list of places i 've wanted to visit for many years . <sssss> la piazza joins the ranks of matt 's big breakfast and pizzeria bianco as being the only places , that i can recall , where there was a wait to get in ! <sssss> no , correct that , this is the only place i can recall , in the us , where i 've been to that there was a crowd waiting to get in before store hours began . <sssss> correction , again : la piazza and todai -lrb- in schaumburg , il -rrb- are the only two places i 've visited , here in the us , that i can recall that had a line of people waiting to get in , in my last 20 years of life thus far . <sssss> i ca n't claim that i 've lined up at matt 's or at pizzeria bianco before they opened for business ... what a cute place ! <sssss> really liked the atmosphere here -lrb- wine cabinet , murals , brick walls , etc. -rrb- , and the staff seemed to enjoy their jobs . <sssss> well , most of them did , anyway ... but why do n't we just get straight to the food ?! <sssss> hmm ? <sssss> i ordered the la piazza bianco http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-dnh48f029ynugtmkkki-q?select=oadu8qvsrhju-4pmfltjyw#oadu8qvsrhju-4pmfltjyw , which is comprised of ricotta , fresh mozzarella and basil , garlic , and garlic butter sauce . <sssss> the cheeses looked so beautiful and exquisite -lrb- ! -rrb- <sssss> , but the pizza came out charred in so many places . <sssss> unfortunately , there was n't a hint of crispiness to its crust anywhere , and this is no exaggeration.http : / / www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-dnh48f029ynugtmkkki-q?select=fv3e74fisrxuvju85caloq#fv3e74fisrxuvju85caloq the pizzaiolo 's excuses for the lack of crispiness were that the fresh garlic sauce and homemade cheeses caused the crust to be more soggy than his other pizza varieties , and bec . <sssss> the restaurant just opened , so that the brick oven was not hot enough . <sssss> his mother offered to have another pizza done , as she did n't want to see anyone dissatisfied . <sssss> i asked if perhaps rolling the crust a little thinner would be possible . <sssss> the second pizza was clearly much better ... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-dnh48f029ynugtmkkki-q?select=sbgkg7yjwlmx4wlhwsejrq#sbgkg7yjwlmx4wlhwsejrq loved the thinner crust , and the crust 's edges on this one were crispy ! <sssss> -lrb- the butter garlic sauce caused the main areas to be soggy , but at least there were crispy areas . -rrb- <sssss> i wish i could 've videotaped handling the slice of pizza of the first one ... it folded without the slightest crunch or flakiness . <sssss> if you 're a crispy thin-crust lover , i suggest you specify this before ordering from here . <sssss> while my beef was due to the sogginess of the pizza crust -lrb- i did n't even mention the burnt areas - i did n't think there was any need to ! -rrb- <sssss> , the ingredients , however , were of high quality ! <sssss> i was so disappointed that the matriarch took the remaining slices away - i only had about one and half slices ' worth of toppings to enjoy :'-lrb- most places i 've been to that offered to correct grievances left the original items on the table , gratis . <sssss> she did , however , offer complimentary dessert . <sssss> their cheesecake is fantastic ! <sssss> http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-dnh48f029ynugtmkkki-q?select=dulitinday5kue075cevjq#dulitinday5kue075cevjq 
3		i 've had mixed experiences dining at stingray ; both times were during happy hour . <sssss> i called to make a reservation but they do not allow them for parties under 6 people , so we took our chances . <sssss> stingray 's happy hour menu is smaller than most but there are great deals on entrees and classic rolls like spicy tuna , the vegas roll , dragon roll , shrimp tempura roll , and the crispy spicy tuna -lrb- my favorite -- it 's not so much a roll but it 's delicious : panko-crusted rice topped with tuna and a jalepeno slice -rrb- . <sssss> the happy hour menu also has good drink specials : $ 1 sake , half price sake carafes and specialty drinks , and $ 4 wine . <sssss> decent sushi at great prices . <sssss> i have n't tried their specialty rolls but they appear to be standard $ 12 - $ 16 creations . <sssss> it was an impersonal dining experience and the servers seemed distracted . <sssss> also , a table for two is very narrow and small ; there is only room under one 's chair to put a purse or umbrella . <sssss> all in all , it 's decent sushi at reasonable prices -lrb- at least during happy hour -rrb- . 
3		initially when i wrote on my fb status `` hey i 'm traveling to phoenix , arizona , do you guys have any restaurant recommendations '' the general consensus from everyone is to go to pizzeria bianco . <sssss> i looked it up and saw all the rave reviews about this place and the warning to new customers that you will expect to wait at least an hour or 2 to get a table in this place . <sssss> but , if everybody 's mama and mama 's mama is raving about this place , i have to go right ?! <sssss> the waitress took down our names and gave us a buzzer letting us know it will be about a 1 1/2 hour wait . <sssss> okay . <sssss> . <sssss> no surprise . <sssss> . <sssss> we expect that we will be waiting a long time . <sssss> so we walk next door to their bar area which looks like it used to be a house and snag a seat outside in the patio . <sssss> you can grab a drink or two while waiting for a table . <sssss> finally the buzzer goes off , `` sweet . <sssss> . <sssss> now we could eat ! '' <sssss> we immediately know what to order . <sssss> the mozzarella is supposed to be handmade was delish . <sssss> . <sssss> very fresh and goes naturally well with the sweet steak tomatoe and olive oil . <sssss> our pizzas finally arrive which we ordered the mozzarella with sausage and basil pizza . <sssss> pizza dough was chewey and not too thick or thin . <sssss> it kind of reminds me of la 's urbano pizza or a lot of these fancy gourmet pizzeria places but if you ask me if it is worth 2 + hours of wait time to get fancy pizza ? <sssss> ummm . <sssss> . <sssss> probably not . <sssss> i think i would go at least once if you are new to phoenix and you want to just go for the experience . <sssss> but i definitely think mother dough in los angeles , california is way better ... minus the crazy wait time . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> come to la , and you will know what i am talking about . <sssss> =-rrb- * fyi : place is about a few blocks , walking distance from the phoenix convention center . 
3		we met local friends for dinner . <sssss> after checking yelp we ordered margaritas which were fine - both the skinny and the classic . <sssss> chips and guac were fine as well . <sssss> the entres were ok . <sssss> service , so so in a large very loud space . 
3		in total loser fashion ... i decided to order some delivery from here . <sssss> a large corde de lane ... is that spelled right ? <sssss> lol ... pretty much its a french dip sandwich . <sssss> they took a lot faster than i thought they would - less than 30 minutes . <sssss> yay ! <sssss> the beef was very tender and thinly sliced . <sssss> the provolone cheese that i ordered to go with it was way yummy too ! <sssss> my only complaint was that the aju was a little too salty . <sssss> i also would like it if they actually had sized that made sense ... who wants an 8 '' or 11 '' sub ?? <sssss> how about 6 or 12 inch sub ?! <sssss> the food was yummy and i 'll definatly be ordering from them again ! <sssss> especially considering they are open all hours of the night and deliver until 3 ! <sssss> :d whoo hoo !! 
3		i went to see dr. underwood as i needed a new pcp . <sssss> the office has very limited hours to see a doc so i had to wait 2 months , which since there was nothing wrong , no problem , i was just going in for a checkup . <sssss> i filled out the paperwork beforehand and faxed it over trying to cut down on time . <sssss> this would have been fine except the paperwork was not put in the system for us when we got there , so no time saved . <sssss> the office staff is friendly albeit slow . <sssss> the pa we saw was fantastic . <sssss> she spent an hour with me , going over medical history , information and answered all of my questions and did n't hurry at all . <sssss> i was floored . <sssss> i have n't been to a doctor who has given me that much time , well , ever . <sssss> this is the reason i will continue to go back and be satisfied . 
3		i like the bean dip . <sssss> the salsa was decent . <sssss> i had the chile colorado burrito , chimichanga style . <sssss> delicious . <sssss> i went with friends . <sssss> it 's not really my neighborhood , but if invited , i would return . 
3		yikes ... this is definitely one of the more seedy thrift stores . <sssss> the smell alone is enough to knock a weaker woman off her feet , and certainly not in a good way . <sssss> in any event , it 's a pretty decent place . <sssss> there are lots of fun things to look at and consequently , make fun of . <sssss> last time we were here we found a lamp made out of a fake toolbox and fake tools . <sssss> the funny thing is , we almost bought it . <sssss> when it comes down to it , there is n't much different between this store and a goodwill except that you can probably spend a few less dollars here . 
3		what i like about this safeway : you can have the butcher marinate your meat for free !!! <sssss> any meat you buy ... they open it . <sssss> . <sssss> put the marinade that you choose ... and reseal . <sssss> love it !! <sssss> what i do n't like about this safeway : there are no self check outs . <sssss> i usually just go in here to get a few items and there is always a long line . <sssss> why did n't they put the self check outs in here ?? <sssss> it is a fairly new place ... geesh . 
3		pretty standard pedicure . <sssss> the salon was clean and busy . <sssss> i called ahead for an appointment and was seated right when i walked in . <sssss> my massage chair did n't work and no one said anything to me the entire time , but overall it was an ok experience . 
3		a little late in writing a review of this place after having attended the event organized by chrissy p . <sssss> the location was nice for the happy hour we all attended because it was a short drive from work . <sssss> parking was adequate as well . <sssss> everyone was out on the cool patio enjoying drinks that they have a couple bucks off of at this time . <sssss> they had peroni on tap which was a plus . <sssss> the pizza i had was only so-so . <sssss> i love and know pizza and have had some fabulous pizza in my day . <sssss> this one , not so much . <sssss> the potential is there , but something was missing . <sssss> not sure if it needed to be cooked longer or what , but it was a little soggy . <sssss> the mushrooms were fresh which was nice , as opposed to canned . <sssss> the only other thing i had was the bread and pesto dip . <sssss> i should have and could have eaten this all night ! <sssss> the bread was warm and crusty on the outside and soft inside . <sssss> the `` green goo '' , which i called it all night , was awesome ! <sssss> i would like to go back and try some different dishes to get a better sense of the food . <sssss> very cool patio with a neat sand fire pit . <sssss> perfect for the nights we are all enjoying right now . <sssss> 3 stars for now ... 
3		it gets very packed for games and friday happy hour . <sssss> blue 32 is a good sports bar , lots and lots of tvs , clean , nice decor the women 's restroom is luxurious as far as restrooms in sports bars are concerned . <sssss> the service is just okay . <sssss> over christmas they had these specialty drinks made with all the rich , decadent liquors . <sssss> one of them was a martini with graham cracker crust on the rim of the glass - i had two of those holiday spirits , sooo good ! 
3		i like this place . <sssss> i like the location and the fact that they have tea as well as coffee . <sssss> oh , and if you sit there they serve your drink in a real glass or mug . <sssss> i like the comfy sofa and chairs at the far end , but if you want more of a work station they have that too . <sssss> my complaint is the fact that they always seem understaffed . <sssss> the last couple times i went here , there was only one girl working the whole shop ! <sssss> poor thing was so busy making drinks that she had no time to clean up or do anything else . <sssss> consequently , it was a little dirty with coffee mugs and napkins left around . 
3		was it good ? <sssss> yes . <sssss> very satisfying given the heat and my tiredness . <sssss> however , in comparison to the plethora of delicious frozen yogurt places that dot the phoenix/valley landscape . <sssss> i was n't super impressed . <sssss> they only had about 8 flavors , and nothing creative or interesting , which is what i 've grown to love about local fro-yo places . <sssss> i do give them credit for having not one , not two , but three mochi flavors ... however , the cost , lack of yogurt flavors , and the high schooler texting on her cell phone when i walked into the shop keep it down at a respectable three stars . 
3		we usually road trip to san diego several times a year and have always talked about stopping at space diner and today we finally did . <sssss> the employees were friendly , bathrooms very clean and the food was good ! <sssss> we would stop again ! 
3		this walmart is soo bad and it allways smells the employes are not so good either but its a wallmart in the getto so ill give it 3 stars 
3		this place is not what it seems from the outside . <sssss> i enjoyed the clean , kitschy decor . <sssss> my friend and i came for lunch on a saturday and the place was pretty empty . <sssss> others were having menudo so i played along . <sssss> my friend is vegetarian and had a bean tostada with a side of guac . <sssss> the chips , salsa were nice - crispy , fresh , the green salsa is f-ing hot . <sssss> her tostada was bleh - just sad and no real flavor . <sssss> the guac was the same . <sssss> my menudo was pretty sad , too . <sssss> the broth was really watery and there were 10 pieces of hominy to about 50 pieces of tripe . <sssss> i 'm not a big fan of tripe but i enjoy the flavor in menudo . <sssss> the service was quick and friendly . <sssss> i honestly was impressed with the cleanliness of the place . <sssss> with all the amazing reviews of this place , i think i 'll try it again . <sssss> i 'm just not running . 
3		is it just me or should n't a cafeteria-style of service include cafeteria-style prices ? <sssss> the food was just ok , the pizza was great , but my daughters thought the bathroom was awesome . <sssss> i 'll return to try the breakfast since i live close by and i 've heard good things about it , but i doubt i 'll return for dinner . <sssss> i would rather dine with actual service if i 'm paying for a restaurant . <sssss> it works at the more casual joes bbq , but here it does n't seem to match the ambiance . 
3		i was excited to try hanny 's out . <sssss> we had a decent sized group of 8 and we had a good table and were very comfortable . <sssss> the service was a bit slow for not being a packed house but our server was newish and she tried really hard so that was all that mattered -- practice makes perfect , i get that . <sssss> the menu is pretty limited to some sandwiches , pizza and salad -- i knew this going into here . <sssss> my chopped salad was good -lrb- well as good as a salad could get -rrb- . <sssss> the pizzas were good and friends enjoyed those . <sssss> but unfortunately the sandwiches were lacking . <sssss> the meats were overdone completely and the bacon seemed to turn to dust once bitten into -- yuck ! <sssss> i do n't even think the guys even ate the sandwiches . <sssss> they told the server that they were not good and did n't want new ones since they were eating the pizza instead from others at our table . <sssss> they took the sandwiches off the bill once they knew they were not happy with them . <sssss> i think this is standard practice especially if the food was n't eaten . <sssss> -lrb- sidenote ** i hate when people eat the entire meal and then complain that they did n't like it and then expect it taken on the bill -- do n't eat it if it was that bad . -rrb- <sssss> hanny 's is a very cool atmosphere and fun and hip , i would definitely return for drinks and i want to try out the pizzas next time . <sssss> i 'll go again . <sssss> i am sure you already heard about the swanky bathrooms and elevator and all that jazz so i wo n't go into it . <sssss> my only problem with the bathrooms was that there was no place for me to put my coat ... that sucked and the soap dispenser involved having to pick it up and squeeze it into my hand -lrb- it was a clear ketchup squeezer with the tip -rrb- , i hate touching more things than i need to in a public bathroom . <sssss> still giving it an a-ok , next trip will hopefully be better ! 
3		walking in i felt like i was in las vegas . <sssss> the tables were clean . <sssss> service was on point and food was extremely good . <sssss> the dish sizes are beyond the normal proportion i am use to . <sssss> definitely a great place to eat - cheers - . 
3		sushi ... fast food style . <sssss> basically a step above the sushi at fry 's but good if you want a quick , cheap meal . 
3		went to arriba today for my second time . <sssss> my first time for lunch and tried the $ 4.99 chicken chimi lunch special . <sssss> the service was good for the most . <sssss> good salsa served with the chips . <sssss> everything was good for the most part , chimichanga was served with rice and beans . <sssss> good enough flavor . <sssss> nothing spectacular . <sssss> the chimi was a bit smaller than it looked on the add and what i am used to seeing at other places -lrb- probably about the size of three tacquitos rolled together -rrb- , but well worth five bucks . <sssss> still i am not a fan of deception , speaking of which when i ordered i was asked if i wanted sour cream and guacamole , which i thought was an offer not an upsell . <sssss> it ended up coming up to $ 2.25 together , nice job bumping up my bill by 50 % . <sssss> overall though i would return and just avoid the upsells . <sssss> the food is good , not great , but you will not find a whole lot better for $ 4.99 . 
3		i am once again on the road for work and staying in anthem , az. . <sssss> there is nothing here , so the restaurant finds are slim pickins ' . <sssss> my team and i visited `` famous '' rays pizza since it was right behind our hotel and for pizza it was okay ... how can you screw up pepperoni pizza ? <sssss> the boys went for the hoagies and the lasagna - each received two thumbs up since they were stuffing their face . <sssss> bread sticks a little bland , but the bread that came out with the lasagna was the best . <sssss> more people carrying out the pizza than dining in . 
3		very disappointed in the new menu . <sssss> the prices also got more expensive . <sssss> almost makes me not want to return because they got rid of my favorite menu item . <sssss> however , great service and food quality as always :-rrb- the buffalo wings are a must every visit ! 
3		okay , so i like canteen and all , but dear lord , let 's turn that music down a notch ! <sssss> these guys have a great happy hour , but i realistically would n't come here if it were n't for that . <sssss> i quite enjoy the small bites ' baby back ribs - the portions are so small , but since they are half price during happy hour , i get two orders ! <sssss> i 'm not a big fan of tequila , but i know they have a big selection -lrb- obviously -rrb- . <sssss> i really like the atmosphere here , and the service has always been good . <sssss> i may or may not come back , but we 'll see . <sssss> three solid stars from me . 
3		first let me start off by saying , this is one of my favorite coffee shops in phoenix . <sssss> so much so that i frequent it at least once a week , to get my iced toddy . <sssss> i like that the iced toddies refills are only $ 1 . <sssss> so i usually get a coffee & go shopping , and then get another one for the road but today was different . <sssss> i was going in for my refill , and i always ask for no ice , because i love strong coffee and it weakens it . <sssss> the ethnic woman with the dark hair interrupted my transaction with the red head to tell me that they `` do n't do no ice because their iced coffee is so expensive . <sssss> so she can give me 4 cubes instead of no ice . '' <sssss> is she serious ???? <sssss> ice coffee is not expensive , especially when it 's coming from a keg . <sssss> coffee in general is not expensive , we are just trained to believe that paying $ 2 for a 16 ounce cup of hot water poured over roasted beans is normal . <sssss> that is why my review is a 3 . <sssss> if i walk in and see her , i would probably turn right around . <sssss> but if jimmy -lrb- ? -rrb- <sssss> is working , with the red hair and tattoo of the press logo on his arm i would definitely stop in ... because he 's amazing & does really cool latte art . 
3		there 's no denying - it is a dive . <sssss> but they have very good food at a reasonable price , i especially like their street tacos . 
3		i m giving it a 3 star rating many because after a bad experience at the glendale 's bus station this seems much better . <sssss> 1 . <sssss> it 's small and tidier than the last one . <sssss> 2 . <sssss> there is free wifi . <sssss> 3 . <sssss> proper place to sit . <sssss> cons are loud ... because of tvs , even though no one seems to be watching them . 
3		being partial to olive & ivy and blanco , sauce and true foods we decided to embark on a culinary journey to reach the other restaurants within the fox empire . <sssss> our next port of call was bloom . <sssss> we went on a fairly quiet saturday evening and were greeted with good service , enjoyed good drinks , had a good salad , and made our way through good entrees . <sssss> do you see a trend forming ? <sssss> everything about the restaurant was good . <sssss> within the very competitive scottsdale corridor `` good '' gets you lost in the shuffle . <sssss> there really was n't anything that really stood out . <sssss> even within the fox family this gets lost in the mix . <sssss> therefore we will probably pass on a return visit in favor of something new . 
3		i was born and raised in chicago and i can tell you this place is the closest i 've come to getting an italian beef sandwich from home . <sssss> only , i get twice as much meat for a cheaper price . <sssss> i bought an italian beef sandwich and small fries for $ 10 and change ??? <sssss> first off the parking sucks , although the location is easily accessible . <sssss> the place is also small and i do n't believe can set 50 people more less 25 comfortably . <sssss> now , on to the food ; i 've yet to try everything on the menu because i went for one thing only : the italian beef . <sssss> while the beef is thinly sliced , something about the seasoning is off . <sssss> i 'm used to getting my sandwich dipped and it not totally sopping up the bread . <sssss> i also do n't remember it tasting so oily . <sssss> as for the fries , again , i 've had better . <sssss> they 're nicely crisped on the outside but dry as hell on the inside . <sssss> wth ? <sssss> makes me wan na go home . 
3		charlies is great if you want cheap drinks and a place to dance . <sssss> i ca n't tell you how many times i 've ended up there because it 's a sunday or tuesday or an equally useless day of the week and my dance partner and i just want a place to shake it . <sssss> the biggest downside is the attitude toward women there . <sssss> fag hags and dykes are welcome , it seems . <sssss> but young-ish , femme-ish lesbian couples might find themselves receiving some serious coldness . <sssss> i stopped going to charlies for months after an episode of outright hostility from the staff . <sssss> come on , guys ! <sssss> we 're not trying to take over your bar . <sssss> we just wan na dance and drink . <sssss> we tip well . <sssss> we 're friendly . <sssss> we 're all family , right ?? <sssss> eventually i ended up back at charlies . <sssss> it seems the employees responsible for most of the discrimination and attitude are not working there anymore . <sssss> thank goodness ! <sssss> now i can get back to dancing my feet off ! 
3		my friend reserved one of the small side rooms here for an event . <sssss> now , this reservation was made to have a viewing party for a popular tv show . <sssss> you would think that they would put us in a room thats sheltered from the majority of the noise coming from the bar . <sssss> they put us in the opposite . <sssss> we could barely hear a thing . <sssss> terrible . <sssss> on the upsaide , our waitress was a sweetheart and did her best to get the volume up and try to at least get captions on our tv . <sssss> she was very attentive and did a good job of keeping all of our orders straight . <sssss> the food was good . <sssss> i got the boneless wings in 2 flavors : bbq and sweet chili . <sssss> the chili ones were really good , the bbq , not so much . <sssss> while this is probably a great place to toss a few back while watching the game of the day or after work , i 'd think twice before reserving a room for an event . 
3		we went to the spotted donkey for a late lunch . <sssss> service was good , we were seated right away . <sssss> we ordered taquitos , one of the appetizers , and it was outstanding . <sssss> my friend got chicken enchiladas for lunch and it was nothing to write home about . <sssss> i ordered the veggie cheese crisp and it was good . <sssss> i will go back but i will try something a little more adventurous than our usual standbys . 
3		i 'm dating myself ... i miss the days of my youth when you almost had to beat the clerks to leave you in peace to browse the racks . <sssss> now , when i want help , it can never be found . <sssss> esp . <sssss> in kohl 's which always looks like its in a state of unpacking this week 's deliveries . <sssss> clothes are okay . <sssss> do n't seem too durable in the long run . <sssss> but i love their earring selection . <sssss> to me this is the place to go for earrings . <sssss> and shoes . <sssss> i do have okay luck finding shoes . 
3		i have always stayed away from chinese buffet , and buffet 's in general due to the low quality of food , i mean lets face it , its all you can eat , you think they are serve you up some gourmet food . <sssss> some of the splendors that can be enjoyed here also can be seen on re-runs of fear factor . <sssss> there was some mini-octopus , and some krill , eyeballs still attached and everything , pretty nasty even to look at . <sssss> i will pay the admission to eat here , soley just to watch other people eat this stuff . <sssss> the food quality for what i tried , was just ok , nothing special . <sssss> it was hot , and the restaurant was clean . <sssss> service is hard to come by , they like to ration out the soda refills and you have to wait for your server to come back while you suck your drink with nothing in it . <sssss> i had to meet people here to eat for a meeting of sorts , so i can honestly say that i would never ever eat here in the future . <sssss> the experience somewhat reinforces my thoughts on buffet style eateries . 
3		this place is great for a quick lunch . <sssss> they have several different options that are sure to please everyone . <sssss> the chicken teriyaki bowl is my usual there and if you like your food with a little spice be sure to try it with the spicy teriyaki sauce . <sssss> john will usually get the beef and chicken bowl and then order one of their sushi rolls as well . <sssss> yogis grill also offers you the option to have brown rice too if you are trying to take a healthier approach . <sssss> overall i enjoy this place when i am looking for a good quick lunch . 
3		a great old time mexican place ! <sssss> the food is good and the atmosphere is what you expect for a traditional slightly run down restaurant . <sssss> the service is always great and the food is also wonderful . <sssss> it is also laid back and good environment for kids . <sssss> the parking is sometimes full and the neighborhood not so great , so try to find a space in the small area . 
3		old people . <sssss> everywhere . <sssss> i love old people . <sssss> but they are slow , so if you 're not in a rush then you 'll survive a visit here . <sssss> just watch out for the golf carts slipping into your parking space right in front of your eyes . <sssss> this place has a starbucks inside , which is pretty cool . <sssss> unless of course , their cash registers break down leaving you stranded with ice cream melting in your bag while you wait 10 minutes for the registers to boot up again in the 120 degree arizona heat . <sssss> i guess i should really blame microsoft windows for sucking . <sssss> this place has typical grocery food with a decent bakery and bread selection . <sssss> not bad for the basic needs of the elderly population , but nothing fancy . 
3		having only a short window for lunch during a training session i decided to try hap 's in phoenix . <sssss> while the service and establishment are bright and open , the special smoked chicken salad was so so . <sssss> a mixture of field greens and minimal tomatoes and raisins left much to be desired . <sssss> the chicken itself was a little bland but i did refuse the side of bbq sauce . <sssss> the salad did arrive quickly allowing enough time to eat and return to class . 
3		there is some sense of order to its madness , when i went in today . <sssss> i agree you can find some hidden treasures here if you take the time to look . <sssss> they also have handbags at discounted prices , nobody has yet to mention for those of us that like purses . <sssss> i have my limits on disarray that i can deal with when shopping and tuesday morning flies below the radar so i enjoy shopping for a treasure or gift here at a discounted price . <sssss> it is small compared to the location i have shopped in washington state , but that did not discourage my need to shop . <sssss> in fact a much larger store lost my interest because it was just to much to sort through ! <sssss> i will still visit larger locations but i 'm pretty happy with this neighborhood location . <sssss> the staff were friendly , they did n't bug me , they were n't overly forward but they were there when others had a need or a question . <sssss> and there was no lines to wait in because the things are all priced and so running price checks were not heard which i find amazing ! 
3		um , so what can i say about this place . <sssss> everyone loves it -lrb- well some on here are n't so impressed -rrb- . <sssss> i would actually give it a 4 * for taste , but a 3 * for value . <sssss> i must say though , our server was great , just how i think excellent servers should be . <sssss> he told us his recommendations and his favorites with his own personal twists . <sssss> we ordered the antipasto , margherita + fennel sausage , biancoverde + prosciutto , and since we were n't full yet -lrb- there were 3 of us -rrb- we got the sonny boy + mushrooms . <sssss> the antipasto was very delicious . <sssss> i would recommend ! <sssss> great mixture of veggies and cheese and olives . <sssss> the best rec from our server was the biancoverde + prosciutto . <sssss> that 's his ultimate fav and that was our ultimate fav ! <sssss> too bad we did n't end with it . <sssss> maybe if we did , i 'd push this up to 4 * ;-rrb- -lrb- it is a must try ! <sssss> flavorful and fresh ingredients . <sssss> superb ! -rrb- <sssss> we ended with the sonny boy and that was a big of a disappointment . <sssss> both my hubs and i did n't care for the gaeta olives on the pizza . <sssss> it was also a bit salty too . <sssss> but we dont ' regret trying something different . <sssss> i do wish we would have just gotten the margherita alone instead of adding the fennel sausage . <sssss> i was n't a fan of the sausage . <sssss> i think i would have liked it just normal . <sssss> our last pizza , the sonny boy came out a bit burnt . <sssss> felt like that was a little unacceptable . <sssss> we did n't have a wait which was great and while we were there it did n't seem like there was a long way . <sssss> just depends on the day and hour . <sssss> not sure how often i would come back . <sssss> glad that i tried it at least once though . <sssss> i guess i was thinking of the wood fired pizza we had in naples , italy and still hoping for something close to that . <sssss> it was n't . <sssss> and for the price , i 'm not totally convinced that it matched , but the flavors were positive , ingredients fresh , service very good . 
3		sadly , this souper salad has closed . <sssss> : - -lrb- 
3		i would have given a four star rating , but today they did n't satisfy me as they always do when i normally work . <sssss> working in the mall i only have an option of food court or brave the lunchroom at work . <sssss> ordered a 2-entree , got the beef broccoli and orange chicken . <sssss> wait i should rephrase that . <sssss> they were more like orange rocks . <sssss> i wish they would make a new batch or scrape those out . <sssss> who wants to break their teeth on rocks . <sssss> i could just see it now , greeting customers with chipped teeth . <sssss> everything else that i ordered was good . 
3		it 's ok . <sssss> prices or not cheaper than regular prices . 
3		man ... really rough reviews from most . <sssss> as i always say , what do you expect ? <sssss> lets delve into the marquee . <sssss> . <sssss> ~ what to do ~ you listen to a boatload of music , from primarily indy acts of numerous genres . <sssss> ~ the good ~ there is some good , like the fact that its relatively cheap to see some acts that in other states would cost an arm and a leg to see ... i got to see ben folds up close for around $ 20 ... that would 've been around 2-3 times that in other places . <sssss> its a good location for a band like ben , not too loud , something a bit less acid rock or death metal . <sssss> the sounds from the band were pretty on , considering what i was expecting . <sssss> for this reason , this location fills my need for a low cost venue to see my niche bands . <sssss> ~ the bad ~ i hate standing for 3 hours . <sssss> i am sorry , but i hate standing . <sssss> its not fun . <sssss> my legs killed me , and that pisses me off . <sssss> besides the legs , there are a bevvy of bad things , like waiting in line . <sssss> i happened to be waiting in line as a haboob approached ... they had the common sense to let us go inside as the haboob came , but they took too long reacting to get people through security and it enveloped some of the late comers . <sssss> so thank god for being early . <sssss> still , the lines are unnecessarily long , and it makes no sense when they want us to drink ... why we are waiting outside . <sssss> the service was ok , i think the bouncers get more intense depending on the group playing . <sssss> please do not tell me that the types of crowds that come in do not vary depending on the genre ... of course they do . <sssss> it was way too hot in the main area , too many bodies pumping in oxygen ... seriously where is the ac , no kidding . <sssss> drinks were too much , i expected that , but they have no selection , it really did n't make sense to buy a beer for that much when there is no selection . <sssss> also , unless you are blind , you can tell ahead of time that given the structure of the inside of the place , it will have bad acoustics for loud metal bands ... its a small venue , what do you expect ? <sssss> ~ the down low ~ a lot of things would need to change to make this venue any better than a general 2 star higher end dive for acts . <sssss> they deserve 2 stars for booking some talented bands and for low cost general admission , but they get 3 for making my dream come true of seeing ben folds in the flesh . <sssss> but still , way too many issues for me to go back to here on a consistent basis . <sssss> a majority of the acts are simply not my cup of tea ... ever . <sssss> also , people who come here seem to be super stupid . <sssss> they get here late , and are upset when they have to wait in an endless line to get in . <sssss> punctuation , my friends ... be punctual and early and it will make you a better person , let alone on time always . <sssss> and stop being a crazy wild drunk who deserves to get hassled by the bouncers . <sssss> ok , i have said my piece . 
3		i am going to have to say , i just do not know what all the fuss is about with this place . <sssss> i have been here a few times or more over many years . <sssss> the service is good however , the food is just not that fabulous ! <sssss> i think that they think if they get people to drink a lot , with their cheap margaritas they will not notice the bland tatse . <sssss> i have given it many trys but , i just can not do better than a 3 star for them . <sssss> they are a good location right on the corner , and they always seem to be busy . <sssss> they have been there for as long as i can remember as well . <sssss> just not loving the food here . 
3		some people go to church on sunday . <sssss> not me . <sssss> i go to costco . <sssss> why ? <sssss> because i do n't have twelve cans of the same kind of soup , six cans of tuna , and a gallon of windex sitting in my pantry . <sssss> that 's not the real reason . <sssss> the real reason i go is so i do n't get yelled at for sitting here playing video games all day . <sssss> so i pack up the truck and off i go , content with the knowledge that if the world should come to an abrupt end , if a deranged fuck from some third world shithole managed to launch a thermonuclear attack on the united states and i somehow managed to survive , i 'd have enough lemon pledge in my pantry to last me the remainder of my god-forsaken life . <sssss> here 's the part where i actually mention something germane to the experience so i do n't get another nasty-gram from yelp hq . <sssss> costco offers a unique shopping experience with its bulk buying opportunities and low , low prices . <sssss> one gallon and one quart of windex is twelve bucks . <sssss> it comes in a handy refill package along with spray bottle . <sssss> a must , for those dirty windows you 've never even dreamed of washing . <sssss> i suggest you park the windex alongside the twelve cans of lemon pledge you 've managed to hoard in the last couple of years . <sssss> useful tip : go around lunchtime on a weekend . <sssss> they have sample carts posted up on every aisle . <sssss> it 's like a smorgasbord of shitty-weird foods you 'd never dream of eating otherwise . 
3		the pizza was okay . <sssss> it 's pretty typical of thin crust pizza i 've had elsewhere , so nothing really jumped out at me there . <sssss> what was impressive was the little bread nibblets -lrb- like pappa john 's breadsticks in texture only -rrb- and sauce that we ordered as an appetizer . <sssss> i 'm not sure exactly what 's in the sauce -lrb- i think marinara , vinegar , olive oil , crushed red pepper -rrb- , but it was very good . <sssss> when my friend was out of bread , he ate the rest of the sauce with a spoon ! <sssss> the beverage selection was good if you were a wine drinker , but the beer and italian soda selections were skimpy . <sssss> i had the root beer , it was average . <sssss> i was surprised they did n't have much more on their menu besides salads , desserts , and pizzas -lrb- where 's the pasta ? -rrb- <sssss> , but that 's okay , after all , it is a pizza place . <sssss> the wait staff was pretty good . <sssss> they were very kind , and attentive to detail such as basil on the margarita pizza . <sssss> they ask if basil is okay on the pizza -lrb- a margarita pizza without basil ? -rrb- <sssss> which is cool , because some people just do n't like basil . <sssss> the location is in the corner of a -lrb- vacant -rrb- strip mall . <sssss> while you are inside , you forget altogether that you are in a strip mall . <sssss> though , i would n't say you feel like you are in italy . <sssss> i liked the eclectic mix of music -lrb- genesis , sting , etc. -rrb- but i guess the italian in me was hoping for some frank sinatra or dean martin . <sssss> oh well , this is phoenix . <sssss> i like classic italian but i am 50/50 on whether i 'd go back . <sssss> i think my leftovers will be the kicker here . 
3		i am pretty much a daily visitor to this aj 's . <sssss> the iced tea is solid . <sssss> amazing selection . <sssss> the americano 's are delicious -lrb- i stopped going to tully 's because that hot assistant manager is no longer there -rrb- . <sssss> also , the americanos are cheaper at aj 's and you get more bang for your buck . <sssss> it 's no secret that i love bang . <sssss> the hot foods section is pretty good . <sssss> sometimes when i am in a pinch , i go over there and pick up a roasted chicken breast to add to my lunch . <sssss> it 's quite good once you pick off the skin . <sssss> i do n't know how you slobs eat that stuff . <sssss> the cheese selection !? <sssss> amazing . <sssss> i got my tax return on friday and like a jackass spent 50 bucks just on cheese . <sssss> i have a problem . <sssss> oh well . <sssss> at least i can feast like a lord . <sssss> unfortunately it will make me sick , but who cares ? <sssss> i can eat like a lord . <sssss> oh lord . <sssss> hmm ... let 's see . <sssss> what else ? <sssss> well ... it 's not a cheap store , but everything is good . <sssss> for my la friends who are reading this ... think of aj 's as a slightly bigger version of bristol farms . <sssss> pretentious ? <sssss> slightly . <sssss> awesome ? <sssss> absolutely . 
3		this grocery store is clean and a fairly good size . <sssss> floral , produce , meat , seafood , wine section , cheese section , yadda , yadda . <sssss> however , i agree with kristi d : it seems as though i -- in my comfy weekend pants and skechers flip flops -- did n't get the same service as the rich ladies in designer jeans and $ 800.00 louboutins . <sssss> hey people , my money spends the same way . <sssss> one guy in the meat department was helpful -- i was looking for chicken , which he was stocking ... so at least one person did n't mind my ponytail and simple weekend attire . <sssss> the only reason i 'll come to safeway are for those things which can not be found at trader joe 's , and that i do n't want to buy in bulk at sam 's . <sssss> i spent probably 150 % of what i would have spent at tj 's ... even with their special card . <sssss> so basically , it works when i have no other choice . <sssss> there 's no reason to spend so much money when you can get the same things for less elsewhere . 
3		dear supreme master , you are a creepy b. thankfully there are such delights as the golden beauty , delectable eggplant and free soup ?! <sssss> order the happy go lucky , because who does n't like potpourri in their lemonade ? <sssss> skip the appetizers because they are anything but . <sssss> the staff is a touch overwhelming , mostly because there is hardly anyone ever here , i mean this place is sparse like whoopi goldberg 's eyebrows . <sssss> they have annoying north phoenix hours , which kind of sucks because i am a fan of lupper . 
3		my wife and i have been eating here for a few years now ... mainly just for lunch . <sssss> stopped by today to grab a gyro sandwich to go ... it was good , ca n't beat the lunch special price ! <sssss> we usually just have the lamb or traditional gyros , vegetarian plates , or an entree salad . <sssss> . <sssss> have tried their entrees and they are just ok . <sssss> . <sssss> so i stick to the tried and true ... if i am hankering for a gyro i think of saba 's 
3		just an anerage asain buffet 
3		i have been twice now . <sssss> the first time was a wednesday night with a friend of mine . <sssss> we met at 6pm and stayed for over 2 hours . <sssss> in that time i only saw 2 people come in to get take out . <sssss> the second time was monday -lrb- a holiday -rrb- at 4:30 pm . <sssss> i saw one person come in for dinner . <sssss> i do n't know how they stay open ! <sssss> that said they have been in business since 1983 !! <sssss> that is amazing to me . <sssss> i have lived here for 12 years and never even noticed or heard of the restaurant on southern , near dobson rd. . <sssss> i find the prices to be a great deal . <sssss> the kids meal is $ 4.50 and comes on a cute brightly colored fish plate . <sssss> it contained teriyaki chicken with rice , a chicken skewer , a gyoza -lrb- pot sticker -rrb- , fresh grapes and edamame . <sssss> a drink was also included in the price . <sssss> the first drink he brought out for my three kids was a bottle of sunny delight . <sssss> the kids were thrilled but opened it and it tasted funny . <sssss> i checked the date and it was expired . <sssss> the owner was apologetic and brought out peach and pineapple drinks in a can . <sssss> the kids were happy with that as well . <sssss> they all ate amazingly well ... very happy with the kids meal . <sssss> i got the tofu teriyaki the first time and the tofu sukiyaki the second time . <sssss> both were good . <sssss> served on a tray with rice , miso soup , edamame and a salad with ginger dressing and 2 pieces of agadashi tofu . <sssss> the price is $ 9 . <sssss> i am a fan of the iced green tea . 
3		i miss this restaurant so much . <sssss> their tortilla soup and jerk chicken salad speaks to my soul . <sssss> i recommend trying these two items because they are delicious . <sssss> while i enjoy the scottsdale location , the tempe one is nice too . 
3		all my veggie friends love this place . <sssss> offers gluten free meals too . <sssss> enjoy their summer squash casserole . <sssss> tried their corn and hatch chili pizza w/kale pesto which i enjoyed . <sssss> somewhat noisy and always crowded . <sssss> they comp 'd us a flourless chocolate cake for a birthday we celebrated . <sssss> nice touch . <sssss> lunch & diner menu is the same . <sssss> get here early or you 'll find yourself waiting . 
3		i like this particular mvd . <sssss> it 's newer , cleaner , and less crowded than many others . <sssss> they use the same `` now serving '' system as the others i have seen , and it seems to work . <sssss> as with the others , getting your assigned number usually takes some time because there is almost always a line . <sssss> today the line went out the door . <sssss> fortunately it was n't too hot . <sssss> one oddity was when we got to our window when we were called , the person looked at our stuff and then told us to go to a different window . <sssss> she walked our stuff over to the other person -lrb- and we were next after they finished with their customer -rrb- , but it was still odd that the person assigned to deal with our number could n't do it for some reason . 
3		the atmosphere is crowded . <sssss> and the food is simply fair to good . <sssss> i had heard quite a bit about this venue prior to going , and have to say , i was slightly disappointed . <sssss> they seem to be understaffed , as the service was a bit slow . <sssss> i 've been here 3 times , and the best time i had was sitting at the bar , but i think that was due more to the beautiful blonde i was sitting next to , than the restaurant . <sssss> parking is attrocious , as well . 
3		first time there , and the staff and service were very friendly . <sssss> ordered the basic burger and it was juicy and flavorful . <sssss> the burgers do n't come with fries , you have to order them separately . <sssss> kinda like delux . <sssss> the fries were alright , kinda plain . <sssss> i had to add salt and pepper to them because they were too bland . <sssss> but the burger did justice , so i really did n't care . <sssss> got a milkshake at the end and i was not impressed . <sssss> it was n't creamy like i 'm used too . <sssss> service was great though , burgers were delish . <sssss> i will be back-but i must add-i used to be a vegetarian and that huge cow on the wall is pretty distracting , kinda made me not want to eat my burger ... ... 
3		good burgers but i love their fries with the seasoning ! 
3		let me start out by saying that don and charlie 's has always been one of my favorite restaurants in the valley . <sssss> as a transplanted chicagoan , it is the only place in the valley that has the lettuce entertainment connection . <sssss> we went the other night and were totally hit with sticker shock with increased menu prices , everything is now ala carte with the entrees . <sssss> our biggest issue was the fact that the only way to get their wonderful chop liver now was to pay for an appetizer that is much larger than their long time hospitality portion :-lrb- and carrot salad comes with that ... give me a break ; does anyone really want to eat that ? <sssss> i wo n't say that we wo n't return , because i know we will ... but , certainly not as often as we used to ! 
3		my husband and i recently took my father to havana 's cafe in search of something different from the usual chain restaurants . <sssss> i read the yelp reviews and was excited to try the black bean fritters and pulled pork ... they were okay , but nothing to obsess about . <sssss> the pork was sweet , not salty or spicy . <sssss> so , if you like sweet pork , this is a good dish for you . <sssss> we got the black bean fritters with avocado paste as an appetizer , which were pretty tasty . <sssss> however , the highlight of my dining experience was the morros -lrb- black beans and rice mixed together -rrb- . <sssss> my husband loved his mojito and my father liked his red sangria . <sssss> the atmosphere was pleasant . <sssss> we were there on a friday night , the place was fairly empty , but despite this , we were seated directly in front of the stage area . <sssss> as soon as the guys started to play , our conversation ended . <sssss> i would appreciated the option to sit in a quieter part of the dining room . <sssss> overall , the experience was okay , nothing horrible , nothing extraordinary , just okay . <sssss> undecided if we 'll return . 
3		perhaps my disdain for phoenix sky harbor is bleeding over into the big us airways carrier there , but i 'm hardly enthused about the joint . <sssss> firstly , it always seems that they ca n't pull it together . <sssss> southwest suffers this same fate here , so perhaps it really is the curse of the airport , but my gates always change , things are always delayed , and that 's a serious pain at phx . <sssss> what i do like is that you 've got plenty of options . <sssss> as noted , they are indeed a big carrier at this ` port , so you 've got a bunch of departures and arrivals to choose from , and you can link up to a lot of places across the us . <sssss> are they my favorite carrier ? <sssss> hardly . <sssss> kinda chintzy . <sssss> but they sometimes win the price/convenience war and they 're not so bad that you wo n't take them up on saving a few bucks every so often in phx . 
3		pretty nice resort . <sssss> we enjoyed having our wedding reception here . <sssss> it won out as it was the only option close to boyce thompson where we held our ceremony . <sssss> we loved that they allowed dogs ! <sssss> our pup had a great time . <sssss> there were some negatives : far walks only partially compensated with golf cart rides , room mix ups , and limited food options . 
3		great cheap appetizers ... we had the sweet potato tots and buffalo blue cheese chips . <sssss> both were good and only around $ 5 each . <sssss> we did find better buffalo chips at a nearby restaurant , and the beers at cold beers were kind of pricey . <sssss> definitely try one of the shakes with booze , though ... well worth the $ 9 ! 
3		sorely lacks with variety in their cardio . <sssss> great choice of assisted weight machines . <sssss> overall nice layout and clean looking but they really should address cardio and spin . 
3		the price is a little bit more than what i would pay , but that thing was huge and delicious ! <sssss> cooked to order with quality meet , and the service was great . <sssss> i only purchased the burger and a drink . <sssss> each item on the menu comes by its self , you pay per item . 
3		this frys usually has a great selection of fresh organic fruits and vegetables . <sssss> a lot better than other grocery stores in the area . <sssss> if i ca n't make it down to phoenix for my fresh fruits and veggies i always stop here . 
3		i should start by saying , the spotted donkey cantina is the perfect restaurant for the over 50 crowd who wants to enjoy a higher-end southwestern food experience . <sssss> honestly , my husband and i are not young ... but were definitely the youngest couple in the entire restaurant by 15 - 20 years -lrb- excepting a few grandkids -rrb- . <sssss> after pondering the reason for the older crowd , our food came and it was painfully clear ... the food is bland , perfect for that older crowd that ca n't handle spicy . <sssss> the chips were delicious , best we 've had in some-time . <sssss> they were thick with a nice strong corn flavor . <sssss> . <sssss> very nice . <sssss> the signature salsas were flavorful , but did not even register as mild on the heat scale . <sssss> the pineapple salsa , we were warned was very hot ... was really on the high end of mild . <sssss> aside from the unspicy food ... i can honestly say my dish was truly bland . <sssss> my carne asada was a good cut of meat , the temperature was well prepared at medium-rare , there was the usual char ... but the meat had zero favor . <sssss> no spices at all . <sssss> this was a dish recommended by our server over the mole ... i should have tried the mole . <sssss> and then there were the tortillas . <sssss> this was my biggest disappointment . <sssss> they tasted like store bought ... you know , that thick floury flavor that mission tortillas have . <sssss> even freshly heated , they would have been a disappointment . <sssss> unfortunately , mine were served stale ... hardened around the edges . <sssss> invest in higher quality , homemade tortillas and ditch those store bought ! <sssss> my dish came with calabacitas . <sssss> . <sssss> which were disappointing as well . <sssss> while the overall vision was good , the squash to cheese ratio was way off ... and my side was almost cold . <sssss> it was obvious the cheese had been melted at one point , but was well cooled before it reached our table . <sssss> decrease the cheese , increase the veggies please ! <sssss> my husbands dish was suppose to be enchiladas . <sssss> they were bland as well and resembled wet tacos . <sssss> i have to say , the black beans were the highlight of our visit . <sssss> they were flavorful , still with some remnants of the salt pork with which they were cooked . <sssss> some of the best black beans i 've ever had . <sssss> many of the dishes , i would have liked to have tried . <sssss> but the sides were unappealing to me . <sssss> i do n't like grits , sweet potatoes , or slaw -lrb- funny . <sssss> . <sssss> those are some of the only things i do n't like -rrb- . <sssss> the server indicated that they would not substitute for any other side ... dishes were to come as prepared , sides and all . <sssss> she would have to ask the chef for permission to substitute a side dish . <sssss> please , be more flexible when it comes to sides . <sssss> also , i would have liked to see an oso bucco on the menu . <sssss> i should have gotten mcgrath 's signature green-chili mac-n-cheese or his green chili stew . <sssss> i know those are good ! 
3		drab , blah & smelly = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = i like doubletree hotels & resorts and am a hilton hhonors diamond member -lrb- highest tier -rrb- . <sssss> this doubletree property looks and is dated . <sssss> my room , 7211 , was on the second floor and when i opened the door , it smelled like a dirty baby diaper -lrb- nappy -rrb- . <sssss> i actually , looked in to the closet and the trash cans to see if there was a diaper left behind , but , alas , there was none to be found . <sssss> i ten took off my shoes and the carpet felt damp . <sssss> ugh ! <sssss> it 's a moldy smell in the this room and not a dirty diaper . <sssss> while this doubletree location has large grounds , a pool , tennis courts and a nicely equipped gym , the rooms leave something to be desired . <sssss> i actually stayed here twice before this year and both stays were just okay and nothing more . <sssss> my second stay here consisted of my forgetting something in the room . <sssss> it took two days and five calls to the hotel to get someone to call me back to help me find my lost item . <sssss> by then , it would 've been too late to find it anyway . <sssss> so , i guess , i 'd have to revise my thoughts on this place and say that you should stay elsewhere . <sssss> actually , the doubletree phoenix hotel at phoenix airport has great service , provides nice amenities and a free full breakfast buffet . <sssss> i like it there much more and will move my business stays to that location . 
3		hubs & i have ordered from streets probably more than 20 times since we moved into our house in the summer of 08 . <sssss> so this review is based on delivery only , since we have yet to actually eat inside the place . <sssss> i can comment on the girl who takes orders though , such a sweetheart ! <sssss> any way , here are a few of our fav items on the menu . <sssss> for apps we love the potato skins w/extra sour cream or the artichoke spinach dip w/extra bread . <sssss> my hubby loves their garden salad w/oil & vinegar dressing or if he 's really craving salad their greek w/no olives . <sssss> for entrees my hubby loves their meatball sub on white w/fries , the cheese calzone w/pepperoni , or the chicken parm . <sssss> i too love the calzones , special baked ziti w/sausage , or garlic pasta substituted w/shrimp . <sssss> their desserts are pretty bomb too , the passion cookie or chocolate surprise are both yum , w/extra ice cream of course . <sssss> oh & they got some new , nifty plastic to go containers , i heart anything i can recycle ! 
3		this place is nothing special . <sssss> unmemorable food , a bit pricy . <sssss> good location though ! 
3		came here for a saturday dinner , the place was pretty big and pretty busy . <sssss> contemporary decor and very nice staff ! <sssss> here 's a bit of recap of what we had : ~ chips & salsa - 3 stars - decent and limitless ! <sssss> ~ crab & shrimp ceviche - 5 stars ! <sssss> i absolutely loved this ! <sssss> very refreshing !! <sssss> ~ grilled fish taco - 3 stars - nice presentation and good . <sssss> ~ beef ` house specialty ' enchilada - 1 star ... the meat was way too salty , and i guess it was so special that just do n't expect this to be your normal enchilada from anywhere ... quite disappointed on this house special ~ tres leche cake - 3.5 stars - it was decent with some whipped cream and strawberries on top , but the cake was n't so soaked and the cinnamon taste was too strong ... i 'd visit again just for some chips and ceviche !! 
3		lunch is down to a science here . <sssss> no waiting for a seat , if you know what you want you can order quickly , your included soup comes seconds later and the meal along with the check only a few minutes follow . <sssss> perfect for a fast sit down lunch . <sssss> the lunch menu is quite cheap $ 5-7 and for 1.50 more they will give you a egg roll and crab puff , however most skip this option . <sssss> i enjoy the vegetarian options . <sssss> there is the monk style vegetables with tofu in a light sauce . <sssss> pad tai with tofu , and two fish options and a vegetable fried rice . <sssss> if you like it hot every table has a container of crushed red pepper in oil , it adds a real flavor punch to any meal . <sssss> most meals come with seamed rice and for .50 extra you can get brown or fried rice . <sssss> there is a refrigeration full of many exotic beverages both alcoholic and non however i have yet to try any of them . <sssss> the outside may scare some away however the inside is decent and the chairs are from a old coffee shop . <sssss> great for a lunch the food is decent and the options are nice if you are in the area . 
3		really the only time i ever walk into an old navy is when i need a new pair of pajama pants . <sssss> it so happens that after like 10 years it was was my husband who up for a new pair . <sssss> we stopped by this location on the way to the wildlife world zoo and were promptly greeted as we walked in . <sssss> i noticed that everything was organized and clean so that was good to see since other locations can be messy . <sssss> there were n't many designs to choose from but we still found a good pair under 20 bucks . <sssss> what i really liked about old navy was that they had a ton of stuff on sale for men ! <sssss> we found a funny graphic tee on sale for only 8 bucks ! <sssss> i personally could n't find anything for me in the women 's section but i 'm also an extremely picky gal . <sssss> the kids ' section looked like fun and i can see myself shopping here for a little girl for some cute , inexpensive clothing . <sssss> i would go back if i 'm in the area and stick the the sale stuff . <sssss> : d 
3		* amended extremely rude ! <sssss> the waiter screwed up my order -lrb- but he was really nice ! -rrb- <sssss> and even though i clearly pointed to the menu where it says `` add a papaya salad to any entree for $ 1.50 '' he brought me a full size papaya salad , which i did not realize until i got the bill - $ 18 for lunch ! <sssss> yikes ! <sssss> when i ordered i had told the waiter i did n't want to do their 4-course special he suggested because i was `` not that hungry '' - so it never occurred to me that he ordered me a full entree size papaya salad plus my entree . <sssss> he brought me a beef meal instead of the chicken one that i ordered , and when i brought his attention to the bill he apologized , and went to get it adjusted . <sssss> 10 seconds later this woman comes out and says `` what , you do n't want to pay for your salad ? '' <sssss> i 'd explained that i was very clear when i ordered , that my entree was also wrong and i 'd had to wait for it to be done correctly - and she just kept berating me in front of other patrons . <sssss> `` you think that salad $ 1.50 ? <sssss> all that shrimp ? '' <sssss> 2 pieces of shrimp - not a pound or anything ! <sssss> i explained that the side salad did seem big , but i 'd never been there before . <sssss> what should i have done ? <sssss> said `` excuse me , but this salad seems a little much for $ 1.50 ? '' <sssss> she said `` so you refusing to pay for your salad ? '' <sssss> and just walked away . <sssss> buyer beware the owner that does not give a crap about repeat business . <sssss> your server screwed up , not me . <sssss> my quiet lunch left me feeling stressed and annoyed - thanks latitude eight . <sssss> amended : ** after seeing this review the owner contacted me directly and sincerely apologized for the miscommunication . <sssss> the server was new , and the food was very good - so i 've amended my review to reflect the overall experience . <sssss> anyone that takes the time to read and respond to reviews definitely cares about repeat business . <sssss> thanks david - 
3		consider this 3.5 stars . <sssss> so here 's the deal . <sssss> the service is great , the atmosphere is nice inside and out and the food is good . <sssss> the prices ? <sssss> not so great for good food . <sssss> the sides were actually better than the main dish which is where they fall from 4 stars , especially considering that entrees are $ 20-25 bucks . <sssss> i had a chicken breast that was panko breaded , smothered in tomatillo & cream sauce , topped with bacon , goat cheese , pico de gallo -lrb- fresh onion , tomato , cilantro , etc -rrb- and crispy tortilla strips . <sssss> frankly i do n't think i ever tasted the chicken . <sssss> or the bacon . <sssss> or the goat cheese . <sssss> those are the things i was looking forward to . <sssss> that 's what sold me on the dish . <sssss> but they were lost in the tomatillo , the cream , the salsa , the tortilla strips ... this dish tried to do too much and suffered for it . <sssss> this chicken was a jack-of-all-trades , master of none . <sssss> the sides-cornbread casserole and spicy mashed potatoes-were very good . <sssss> the bottom line ? <sssss> good but not great and if i 'm paying $ 21 for a chicken breast i should be wowed . 
3		this place is exactly what it sounds like , a buffet of pizza . <sssss> they have your standard cheese , pepperoni , sausage , etc. . <sssss> they also make a bunch of different kinds . <sssss> when i was there they had a jalapeno beef pizza , which was pretty good . <sssss> they also had alfredo sauce style pizza . <sssss> i am sure if there was a specific type that they would make it for you . <sssss> they also have a section of salad and other stuff . <sssss> if you are looking for the best pizza in town , this is not it . <sssss> it is an inexpensive buffet and the quality is pretty good for the price . <sssss> if i had another hankering for multiple types of pizza at once i would go there again , but it will not be option 1 for pizza on a regular basis . 
3		i come here a lot because the food is awesome but the service is horrible . <sssss> i do n't think i 've ever come here without the waitress forgetting at least one part of my order . <sssss> and the hostesses are somehow never at the front ? <sssss> i do n't know . <sssss> stick to lunch and weekdays , when the place gets busy it 's a real shit show . 
3		you use the card here , and it is free ... but ... the cheapest washer is $ 1.99 and it is for a very small load . <sssss> the next size is up is the size of washer that most people would have at home . <sssss> . <sssss> that was $ 3.99 . <sssss> dryers are 30 cents for 8 minutes . <sssss> i payed almost $ 20 to the equivalent to 6 loads of laundry in a residential washer ... ouch !!!! <sssss> place was super clean and the staff was very helpful . <sssss> you can also use your visa/mastercard here . 
3		very busy place and usually a delayed time to see the doctor even if you have an appointment set . 
3		cornish pasty = upscale hot pocket i had the shepherd 's pie pasty and cole slaw . <sssss> both were fairly tasty . <sssss> the cole slaw had great crunch but was too oniony . <sssss> the pasty was perfectly cooked unlike a hot pocket which is either frozen in the middle or scorching hot . <sssss> the pasty had a lot of different flavors going for it and a good gravy accompanying it . <sssss> also the restaurant has a good vibe to it . <sssss> all in all , the pasty was good but not good enough to come back . <sssss> hot pocket 
3		this goodwill is alright , i have been to better . <sssss> their selection is okay , cleanliness is okay and organization is okay . <sssss> all goodwill 's prices are the same , as far as i know . <sssss> the staff is helpful and i never have trouble finding somebody if i need help . 
3		was n't blown away as suggested by some reviews , but pretty good tacos for the cheap price . <sssss> but they are not the best i 've ever had and the service is very slow . <sssss> i did n't think the line was too long and was surprised to find myself still in line 15 minutes later . <sssss> disappointed to see only carne asada or chicken choices . <sssss> the tacos were a great size for a late night snack . <sssss> i found the mini quesadillas to be too salty , although it did have a nice crisp . <sssss> the salsa roja had a nice spicy kick . <sssss> the horchata was too creamy and sweet . <sssss> i would n't go out of my way to come back . <sssss> but if i were in the area and had the nighttime munchies , it 'd be better than a 24 hr fast food joint . <sssss> just be ok with waiting up to 45 minutes for some tacos . 
3		i have tried 3 or 4 dishes there and none impressed me . <sssss> their pad thai is okay ... one of those restaurants that i would eat at if i craved thai and there was nothing else nearby . 
3		we were looking for a sushi place closer than saketini , and this place fit the bill . <sssss> sushi was all normal and fairly good , the ebi ebi roll and spicy shrimp rolls were excellent . <sssss> however , the boston roll and the alaskan roll were nasty - according to the menu , these are california rolls with spicy tuna and spicy salmon on top . <sssss> what the menu does n't mention , is that the fish on top is just the chopped up odds and ends held together with some kind of sauce . <sssss> the fish in those 2 rolls was definitely not very fresh , either - my guess is its the trimmings from the last few days . <sssss> overall , ok service -lrb- although our waitress did not refill our drinks until we flagged her down -rrb- , and good food , aside from those 2 rolls . 
3		coffee is good , atomshere is nice , can get a little noisy , the back room is good for small meetings . 
3		sort of a mixed bag here . <sssss> i 'm trying to figure out what type of restaurant el rico 's is . <sssss> when you first walk in you get the whole rubio 's vibe with the whole go up and place your order and pay . <sssss> you then go sit down and it 's full service from that point . <sssss> hopefully they reconsider the go up and order thing because the work flow up there is terrible . <sssss> we had 4 families in front of us -lrb- not really that much -rrb- , it took us 15 minutes -lrb- maybe a couple of minutes over -rrb- just to order . <sssss> had it not been for megan 's 5 star we would have walked out . <sssss> their menu is definitely a full service price so it 'd be nice to just immediately sit down . <sssss> one other bad thing is the lady that took our order says that a bottle of beer is $ 4.50 . <sssss> way overpriced ... cut it to 3 , still make a good margin , and actually have an alcohol business . <sssss> i ordered the burrito and taco combination plate . <sssss> carne asada in the burrito and shredded chicken in the taco . <sssss> my girlfriend went for the enchilada plate with shredded chicken . <sssss> she was just so-so on the enchilada 's -lrb- i actually thought they were good -rrb- . <sssss> the shredded chicken was well seasoned and also perfectly cooked . <sssss> a lot of times you suffer with dry chicken in an enchilada so i was pleasantly surprised . <sssss> the chicken in my taco was the same , good quality , perfectly cooked , perfectly seasoned . <sssss> the carne asada meat was higher quality and cooked right , a good amount of char to the meat without over-cooking it . <sssss> they appear to use lime as part of their marinade and it was overpowering towards the end . <sssss> the burrito could have also been stuffed with more meat . <sssss> i 'll say there is a better carne asada burrito just up the street that is cheaper ... but hey , ca n't win em all . <sssss> they do serve you chips and salsa and the salsa was pretty good . <sssss> half of the chips were undercooked , greasy and soft . <sssss> combinations come with beans and rice ... beans were good -lrb- slightly under seasoned -rrb- and the rice was very good . <sssss> not clumpy at all . <sssss> they do n't make their own hot sauce , only tapatio . <sssss> decent patio with misters outside and the decor inside is sort of like a patio setup ... wooden drawers painted with old town mexican style -lrb- and colors -rrb- . <sssss> the seating is almost like a bistro patio set and not overly comfortable for girls wearing shorts -lrb- will leave the pattern marks on the back of your legs -rrb- . <sssss> it 's probably more of a 3 1/2 star for me ... somewhere in between so-so and good . <sssss> a place you 'll probably find yourself at more than once , but wo n't really rave about it to your friends . <sssss> a four star if it 's around 15-18 bucks for two ... a three star when it 's around 25-30 bucks . 
3		i 'm on my `` showgirls '' diet which includes brown rice , vegetable and evian . <sssss> surprisingly , i got all of that at neo tokyo , with some chicken as well . <sssss> we stopped by for lunch , and enjoyed fresh food at a very decent price . <sssss> the lunch special was $ 6.50 and came with a spring roll . <sssss> the guy working was friendly and offered some recommendations . <sssss> i do n't hang out in this part of town much , but if i 'm in that part of town in the near future , i 'd stop by here again without a doubt . 
3		i went here for st. paddy 's day brunch with some friends , and overall it was a good experience . <sssss> the food was good , the atmosphere is great -lrb- live music on the lawn just outside their patio area ! -rrb- <sssss> , service was friendly and helpful . <sssss> however , a few things were wrong enough for me that in spite of the good food , i 've had to knock a couple of stars off of this rating . <sssss> for starters , we ordered their featured `` green bloody mary '' , as we were feeling particularly festive . <sssss> the result was a bunch of cilantro and tomatillo with undetectable alcohol content -lrb- maybe it was just really buried in the salad of a drink -rrb- . <sssss> i ca n't believe they were actually serving this to people . <sssss> i appreciate the attempt , but when it comes to bloody marys , there 's no shame in sticking with the classics . <sssss> next point of contention : the portions . <sssss> the dristrito benedict was delicious , but it was seriously 6 bites worth of food for $ 14 . <sssss> this restaurant is not high-end enough to get away with puny portions . <sssss> i was so hungry that i actually continued drinking the cilantro concoction . <sssss> if i came back here -lrb- which i might ; like i said , the food was good and i 'd just order a different drink -rrb- , i 'd make sure to load up on appetizers . <sssss> lots of items of the brunch menu looked amazing , but i 'm assuming you 'd need to order in multiples if you have an appetite like mine . 
3		so its thursday night and i got a certificate from resturant.com for valle luna and thought i have n't been out with the kids in a while wonder if they are up to trying a new place , and guess what , they were , ok when i say kids , i really mean 21 , 19 , & 16 yr old , yea they are not really kids , but they are my kids :-rrb- it was my 1st time there and i really wanted to like valle luna , it 's just right up the street from me . <sssss> i did some research and read some reviews of friends and thought ok , this is going to be a good place ! <sssss> when we 1st got there they put us in a small booth , we were sitting on top on each other , the 21 yr old is 6 months prego and they placed us in table where it was very tight and making her uncomfortable and i had my left handed son sitting next to me elbowing me already and the food had n't even arrived yet -lrb- s/n : i really think he sits by me to bug the crap out of me -rrb- so we asked for a bigger table and we got moved almost into a small booth on the other side , my daughter said yea that 's not going to work , that 's what the other one was and it hurt to sit there , so we were moved to a table with the view of the lake , it was nice , felt like was in a different area then just chillin in chandler it was happy hour when i arrived and it was three-o thursday , all three olive vodka drinks for 3 bucks , so i ordered the cherry smash , it was a pretty drink , but way too strong for me , i know i was even shocked i could n't finish it ! <sssss> the chips , bean dip & salsa arrived to the table , now to me the chips were not that bad , tasted ok , some of the reviews said it was the worst part of it , to me they were ok , the salsa on the other hand reminded me of pace picante , one was sweet and the other was just like tomato sauce , packed no heat what so ever , but the kids liked it and ate it . <sssss> ok i 'll just tell you what they ordered real quickly : 21yr old ordered the tamale dinner , she loves tamales , she thought the flavor was good , tamale itself was a little dry , but it cured her caving . <sssss> 19 yr old ordered grilled asada burro dinner , she loved it ! <sssss> this plate looks like something i should have ordered , she loved it ! <sssss> 16 yr old ordered southwestern chicken breast , he did n't care for it , he said the chicken tasted like i cooked it , meaning it looked great , but was dry , sometimes i just wan na smack him haha after reading everyone 's reviews , i was really looking forward to what i ordered , i ordered the fundido , i understood that it was deep fried , but mine looked and tasted like it was left in the fryer for way too long , the tortilla was inedible , i scraped everything out of it and left the shell on another plate . <sssss> the beans & rice were good , and so what the filling inside the tortilla , the jalapeno-cream cheese could have had more heat for , but was very good . <sssss> i do n't think i will be ordering this dish again . <sssss> we were having a good time talking with each other and decided that we wanted desert , so 2 of us ordered the fried ice cream and one ordered the chocolate taco . <sssss> i was one of the ones who ordered the fried ice cream and i chose caramel for topping instead of chocolate , and i asked if it could be drowned in caramel and it was , , omg it was soo delish !!!!! <sssss> i do want to come back to valle luna to give them another try , the kids did enjoy themselves and the food , so they are willing to go back with me . 
3		today was our 2nd visit , and if it had been our first , we probably would not go back . <sssss> we really like the atmosphere and the ambiance . <sssss> the service was very good both times . <sssss> the first visit was a nice surprise , and we were very pleased with our meals . <sssss> today , not so much . <sssss> the new york strip steak was hardly pink at all and was dry . <sssss> a restaurant of that caliber should not have to rely on customers to send back their over cooked food . <sssss> the stir-fry with shrimp was way over drenched with teriaki sauce and the small shrimps were tough . <sssss> the house salad was very good and the mashed potatoes and chopped vegetables were good . <sssss> the crab artichoke dip with garlic toast was very tasty . <sssss> so it was not a total loss . <sssss> we had the $ 10 gift card given out on our 1st visit , but the waiter did not take it off because , `` we had to tell him it had $ 10 on it '' . <sssss> so watch that if you go for a second visit . <sssss> will we go back ? <sssss> ... well , there is still the $ 10 credit ... maybe . 
3		not much of an irish atmosphere , kinda dumpy , though a decent divey place to enjoy cheap drinks with some good pals . <sssss> they do have a tiny outdoor patio where you can smoke . <sssss> i suggest using this as a jumping off point to get your evening started . <sssss> it 's also chill during the week if you need an ultra-casual spot to relax . <sssss> juke box leaves the tuneage to the patronage -lrb- risky -rrb- . 
3		carly 's is a cute , unpretentious little joint downtown with good food , a solid drink selection and live music on occasion . <sssss> nothing fancy , but i 've never felt overcharged or unsatisfied after a visit . <sssss> the staff is always super friendly . <sssss> lighting ranges from modest in the dining area to `` dim enough for drinkin ' '' by the bar . <sssss> the sangria is tasty , and the wine selection is wide enough for your average chillout night . <sssss> the menu is healthy and diverse -- various salads , creative sammiches , pita , hummus , feta , olives , and i seem to recall trying an appetizer or two at one point . <sssss> a few times , the live music 's been a bit too loud for the small space . <sssss> and i like live music , but only when it 's good . <sssss> :-rrb- i 've never seen it empty here , so if you 're downtown and just want the feel of people around , this is probably about the best casual option , especially on a weeknight . 
3		very cute wine bar with a relaxed atmosphere . <sssss> i went on a sunday evening so it was nice and quiet , perfect for hanging out with friends and enjoying a long ambling dinner . <sssss> being able to watch the light rail go by gives it a very urban vibe which is a nice change from the usual suburban strip mall locale of most places in phoenix . <sssss> i went here with a group of four for spring restaurant week . <sssss> i am not sure if this was really such a good deal since the pizzas on their menu all sounded awesome and were much cheaper than the $ 30pp that we paid . <sssss> but we happily decided to save that for another time and so we all ordered off the prix-fix menu . <sssss> everyone at the table liked their food though one person felt their chicken was a little undercooked . <sssss> we got a variety of options so that we could all sample each others food . <sssss> for me , the highlight was the gazpacho . <sssss> it was really delicious . <sssss> none of the other dishes were really out-of-this-world great , but still impressive food for a place that appears to primarily be a wine bar . <sssss> the best part was that our server was able to recommend wines for each of us that we had never tried before but really enjoyed . <sssss> i love trying new wines so that was a lot of fun . <sssss> a small plus is that it prints the name of the wine on the receipt so i can actually remember the name to hopefully purchase a bottle another time . <sssss> even though i do n't come to this midtown area often , this place is right down the street from the art museum so i will definitely be back . 
3		my wife and friends went for lunch the the other day and liked it so i thought i 'd give it a try . <sssss> nice place , nice menu - good selections . <sssss> i had the meatball hero lunch special . <sssss> good meatball hero -lrb- meatballs with marinara + extra for cheese to make it meatball parm -rrb- - it was good ; too big for lunch - i would have been satisfied with half with a handful of chips and a deli pickle spear or peperocini on the side vs. just the hero sitting on the plate solo -lrb- hope the owner reads yelp ! -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> i 'll go back and try something else . <sssss> good food , good location should do well . <sssss> who mounted all those nice tv 's in there ? <sssss> shaquille o'neal ? <sssss> you get a neck ache looking up that high ! <sssss> ps - hey food runner , when you deliver a slice of pizza and it starts to slide off the plate do n't use your bare hand to move the pizza - gross ! <sssss> you know you saw me watch you do that too ! 
3		not impressed . <sssss> the food was only so-so . <sssss> i can see where people might be drawn to the old town atmosphere , which was pleasant , but i can get better food at filabertos . 
3		so i sent the lemongrass shrimp back . <sssss> they were gross . <sssss> not edible . <sssss> i 've only been here twice . <sssss> the first time i thought the food was good . <sssss> i had shrimp , a chicken dish and a spring roll and it was was pretty decent . <sssss> the second time -lrb- tonight -rrb- everything was gross . <sssss> like my stomach churns at the thought of ever going back . <sssss> the service was very good , though . <sssss> so at least that aspect of my experience tonight does n't make me quesy . <sssss> i feel bad wrting this because they were so nice . <sssss> i was going to give it 2 stars but they were really nice to me so 3 stars . 
3		i met craig w here for lunch today . <sssss> we both had egg rolls . <sssss> i had pho with sliced beef and shrimp . <sssss> craig had a vermicelli stew of some sort and a boba drink . <sssss> i was full but not stuffed , craig could not finish his . <sssss> when it comes to vietnamese food i am still learning how to pick what i want and add stuff to make it my creation without overwhelming the taste of how it started . <sssss> i liked what i had and will most certainly return to try something else . <sssss> we arrived towards the end of lunch hour and there was a large party in the center of the restaurant and we got the only free table . <sssss> i think they understand lunch hours and did a good job of getting us served quickly . 
3		so far , not so good . <sssss> our waiter ignored us and we had to snag another who just happened to catch my eye and asked if he could help . <sssss> hopefully the food will be worth the frustration . <sssss> well they redeimed themselves . <sssss> the food was great and our new waiter was the best ! <sssss> you got ta try the banana pudding . <sssss> it rocked . 
3		i am disappointed that my experience here did n't match up to all of the great review this place has gotten , i was excited . <sssss> i heard about elevate from some people at work , and since my husband is a coffee fanatic , i thought we should definitely try it . <sssss> the decor was awesome but getting to the counter was a different story ... the 3 women on staff seemed totally and completely disconnected from their work . <sssss> no smiles , no suggestions since it was our first time , just long faces and monosyllabic answers to my questions . <sssss> i would understand if it was 1 person maybe having a bad day , or even if it were early on a sunday , but it was 10 am and it was all three of the women that we interacted with . <sssss> on the positive side : i had a vanilla bean creme -lrb- no coffee -rrb- and it was very good , like a frappe but without the java kick . <sssss> i also had a sausage breakfast burrito , which was really good -lrb- they have pepper-jack cheese which added a little unexpected heat to it . -rrb- <sssss> my husband had an americano which he said was good , but his nutella & banana crepe had been microwaved , so it was chewy . <sssss> he ate the other half of my burrito instead of finishing it . <sssss> i am not prone to giving bad reviews and because of the food they 're getting a 3 instead of a 2 , but the lack of personable service was very disconcerting and i do n't think i 'll go back for that reason . 
3		this is a fast food place , not cooked to order . <sssss> food is already pre made . <sssss> i ordered the mungo and pork sinigang . <sssss> mungo was a little dry and a tad overcooked but sinigang was real good , just the right sourness . <sssss> portions were small but the price was reasonable . <sssss> had to order the halo halo and it was really good . 
3		i had the soppressata with aged provolone & roasted peppers . <sssss> it was a solid sandwich overall . <sssss> the quality of ingredients was pretty good , but the only part that gets me is the price . <sssss> $ 8 + tax ? <sssss> wow all that `` supply and demand '' stuff i learned in econ class was n't a joke . <sssss> worth trying once , but i do n't think this is a place i 'll be grabbing lunch at on a regular basis . 
3		decent burgers , really friendly service , and a very basic , straightforward menu . <sssss> i was interested in trying this place out after reading all the rave reviews from all over the country so when it finally opened up in phoenix , i decided to give it a shot . <sssss> the burgers are definitely good , done very well , the fries are great tasting too and they give you a lot of them , if you go and order the `` large fries '' you 're going to find a whole paper sack absolutely filled to the brim with them . <sssss> all in all , five guys is a nice place to grab a quick lunch , a little bit on the pricy end for fast food but there is a difference in quality between this place and the mcburgerbarns out there , that 's for sure . 
3		had lunch here last week . <sssss> i ordered the special which was fish tacos . <sssss> my husband ordered the shredded beef taco and red enchilada . <sssss> i did n't really care for my dish . <sssss> it just was n't very tasty . <sssss> my husbands was good . <sssss> they refilled our chip bowl promptly . <sssss> not very big but it was very busy . <sssss> our waitress was attentive . <sssss> oh yeah , an older gentleman -lrb- possible the owner ? -rrb- <sssss> offered us some gum from his large bowl on the way out . <sssss> everyone was polite and i like that . <sssss> i will be back for the enchiladas next time . 
3		i went here a few weeks ago and ended up only getting one drink because they were out of all of the alcohols required to make a manhattan -lrb- which is what the bf wanted -rrb- . <sssss> i had their saketini and it was very weird and tasted a lot like seaweed . <sssss> not my fave . <sssss> their menu did n't have a lot of vegetarian items , so we passed and went somewhere else . <sssss> i do n't think i would come back here again for drinks , but i may try their food sometime . 
3		went here for lunch today with a big group . <sssss> the speedy lunch option is a good way to go . <sssss> it 's only about $ 10 for a 9-in pizza and a soup/salad , and you 'll probably get to take some of the pizza home -lrb- unless you 're starving -rrb- . <sssss> everything was just ok . <sssss> it was good enough to eat , but i did n't fall in love with anything . <sssss> their butternut squash soup was pretty good , but it 's not as good as the one i can make at home . <sssss> i heard the veggie salad is sort of the fav , but did n't get it myself and the people who did did n't comment on it . <sssss> the pizzas were also ok , but no one was ready to rave about their pizza at the end of the meal , except for the fig pizza -lrb- sorry i do n't have the official name because it 's not on their website/dinner menu -rrb- ! <sssss> so , for an easy , quick bite , it 's probably a place to try if you 're in the area . <sssss> but i do n't plan on going back again , and i probably would n't recommend it to friends considering the other great restaurants in the area -lrb- esp . <sssss> at the borgata across the street -rrb- . 
3		probably wont be giving this place a second chance . <sssss> came in thursday morning -lrb- 4th of july -rrb- with my fiancé because we had heard many good things about it . <sssss> the service was great . <sssss> coffee cups stayed full and the staff was very kind . <sssss> and the prices were pretty cheap . <sssss> the only disappointment was the food . <sssss> we both got omelets and my fiancé ordered a side of biscuits and gravy . <sssss> the omelets were thin . <sssss> it was like an egg crepe with ham , onions and cheese stuffed in the middle . <sssss> the biscuits were n't that great and the gravy was terrible . <sssss> it had no flavor whatsoever . <sssss> it 's so unfortunate that their food was so bland because the service and prices are great . 
3		staff was not too helpful when i called to ask if they had found my debit card . <sssss> eat there but make sure you do n't need anything from these guys cause they are not too helpful . 
3		first time here . <sssss> pad thai okay with plenty of shrimp , chicken and tofu . <sssss> juicier than traditional thai food . <sssss> good service . <sssss> deconstructed taco looked good . <sssss> enough food with each meal . 
3		i just do n't get it . <sssss> everybody raves about this place including my friend who brought me . <sssss> i just did n't think anything was that good . <sssss> i will give chino bandido another chance eventually , hopefully i have a better experience next time . 
3		i decided to try this place for lunch . <sssss> i 'm on mill ave often , and i 've seen it since it was being built , so i thought i ` de try it . <sssss> the decor was interesting - kind of trendy . <sssss> i ate at a high table in the bar area , and it was adult contemprary rock chic . <sssss> the staff was pleasant and the service was reasonable . <sssss> i had the mushroom club and i enjoyed it . <sssss> the addition of the mushroom flavor to the club sndwich was welcome . <sssss> the amount of meat to bread was good , making a decent sandwich . <sssss> expect to pay $ 7-10 for lunch . <sssss> truthfully , three stars is on the low side , but i 'm not sure i would rate it at four - more like a three and a half . <sssss> i 'd go again , but i 'm not sure that i 'll coming here for it specifcally . <sssss> the biggest challenge is that it 's a pretty good place surrounded by some really great places . <sssss> i would expect it to be a much better place late nights - it seems like that kind of place . <sssss> i would actually like to see this place with some live music late nights . 
3		on an early saturday evening the restaurant was n't crowded but as time went by the noise level increased a few decibels as families with children started to arrive . <sssss> we had asked to be seated close to the door in view of the big screen tv showing the olympics but the ambient noise level became barely tolerable as the kids behind us squirmed to be seated . <sssss> the good news was sam adams on tap plus finally , a restaurant with lettuce wraps appetizers with more than enough lettuce to cover the minced chicken , shitake mushrooms , water chestnuts and green onions in a soy ginger sauce . <sssss> most of the time more lettuce is needed and one has to wait for more . <sssss> in terms of lettuce wraps , pf changs does a better job but as i say there was more than enough lettuce . <sssss> normally , we order one of the thin and crispy neapolitan pizzas such as the classic margherita but this time broke ranks for the `` new '' pizza called pear & gorgonzola . <sssss> the ingredients -lrb- caramelized pears , gorgonzola , fontina and mozzarella cheeses , caramelized sweet onions and chopped hazelnuts -rrb- sounded different and inviting . <sssss> indeed it was different from the usual fare and quite a mixture of tastes with some crunch and caramelization flavors . <sssss> it was somewhat of a surprise to have it topped with field greens tossed in a house gorgonzola ranch dressing . <sssss> thumbs up for the pizza and neutral to negative for the field greens topping . <sssss> if there had been a choice of toppings another would have been ordered . <sssss> next time i would request a quieter portion of the restaurant away from the front door . 
3		i like the fancy walking beer cooler . 
3		i have not eaten in at jimmy johns , but have done take out from them several times . <sssss> i love how fast they are . <sssss> one time i stopped in and by the time i got back to the car , the same song was on ! <sssss> the sandwich i get -lrb- # 12 , beach club -rrb- , is delicious and it 's great ! <sssss> i have one problem , however -- a few weeks ago , jj came to my work -lrb- surprise elementary in el mirage -rrb- and delivered samples for the teachers , which was wonderful ! <sssss> a few weeks after that , my coworkers called there to order sandwiches for delivery for my birthday . <sssss> my school is on the border of surprise and el mirage , and we were told that since we were on the wrong side of greenway , they could not deliver to us . <sssss> as teachers , we do n't have the time to go out for lunch , and since we were right on the border , it would 've been nice if they could 've delivered - i mean , why send us samples when you then wo n't come to us ? 
3		went here recently with a family member who was back in town and used to go to bbg all the time . <sssss> i 've been here plenty of times over the years , and i do have to say that it is sad to see the contraction that they have experienced ... i remember when they had at least five locations in the valley . <sssss> based on their restaurant list , it does seem if they have found a niche in food court/airport type settings , so maybe that will work out better for them . <sssss> i got the chicken tacos in corn tortillas . <sssss> they were ok , nothing interesting , nothing bad about them . <sssss> should have stuck with the usual , black bean and cheese burrito with steak or chicken ... i 'll know for next time . <sssss> a strong benefit of bbg is the unlimited free chips they have out , usually nice and fresh . 
3		harlow 's cafe looks like the inside of the bar from `` cheers '' . <sssss> the walls are wood-paneled and like everything else in harlow 's inspires thoughts of how the place could be updated for the modern age and keep the same cozy feeling . <sssss> i suppose that should be the theme of this review -- updating your restaurant . <sssss> the food here tastes great , but it is very typical breakfast fare . <sssss> fried in vats of butter and oil without concern for the carbohydrate levels of you or your unborn child . <sssss> does n't get much better for a fierce hangover , which will be promptly cured from the coma you 'll slip in to after any of the specialty plates . <sssss> one of drawbacks of this anachronistic beacon of breakfasts are the prices . <sssss> apparently adjusting for inflation was lost on the menu creator -- a side of hash browns costs four dollars , while two eggs and some hash browns will cost you ten bucks , but you get a drink with that . <sssss> do n't forget 3 bucks for a cup of coffee . <sssss> like other users have mentioned , parking can be a pain when it 's busy . <sssss> they close at 2 pm , so here 's a hint : go at 1 pm . <sssss> if this review were based solely on the service it would be 4 stars , the staff was very friendly despite the fact that they only seem to hire women . <sssss> the guy who cooks your food is a jolly looking rotund chef who knows how to fry an egg . <sssss> not sure if i 'll go here again unless someone i know requests a biscuit that will survive a nuclear holocaust . 
3		the service was great -lrb- almost five stars ! -rrb- <sssss> theproperty itself is a bit tired . <sssss> granted i am a 5 star spa girl , but with the economy ... . <sssss> the place needs a face lift , wood rot , ant problem & mildew ... not in the suites . <sssss> overall i would give it another chance . <sssss> comfy bed , ok food do n't expect much if you are a cook . <sssss> the best , due to the economy the staff falls all over you . <sssss> had a pool , suana and hot tub to myself on a friday . <sssss> so sad for them because the people are sweet . <sssss> . <sssss> hopefully things will pick up and they will do some deffered clean up . <sssss> i can see how a family would like this place . 
3		shit , i am so bummed i did n't have the same experience as the others did here . <sssss> maybe i just showed up on an off day . <sssss> my gf and i tried this place out and i was really shocked at the letdown . <sssss> i ordered a bfast sandwich and it arrived cold and really did n't have much flavor . <sssss> i did n't try anything other than that so maybe there are better choices that i missed . <sssss> hopefully we will be back in the area and can give it another try . <sssss> yelp has never let me down so it deserves a second chance . <sssss> i will write another review after my next experience . 
3		barely resisting crazy buffet & their brand new mongolian bbq just across the parking lot , i stopped into this nice coco 's for lunch , starting with a delicious little crock of piping hot cheese & potato soup . <sssss> then it was on to a club sandwich on good quality whole wheat toast , with a big , tasty dill pickle spear on the side . <sssss> everything was right about this place , including the ambiance , seating comfort , food , service & price -lrb- $ 7.99 -rrb- ! 
3		went there to grab lunch while on biz travel that was not too far from the airport . <sssss> menu was nothing special . <sssss> service was prompt . <sssss> food was good . 
3		not truly my scene , but it was fun . <sssss> i probably just was n't into it that night . <sssss> i try to be a fun participant . <sssss> drinks were cold , music was the popular kind to sing along to . <sssss> i 'd go again . 
3		small interior , great little patio just off the main drag in old town scottsdale . <sssss> the place is easy to find because of its funky lodge look it is totally out of place for the neighborhood . <sssss> i think the place is suffering from an identity crisis . <sssss> on one hand it is trying to be a old town scottsdale meat market , but on the other hand it is trying to have a down home kind of feel . <sssss> the burgers and sandwiches are huge with huge buns . <sssss> nothing fancy about the fixings and the food is overpriced but i guess they have higher rent where they are located . <sssss> if this place were in phoenix or tempe it would be 35 % less . 
3		we attended a group event here a few months ago , the set-up was nice , the food was ok , bland but typical for a large group meeting . 
3		well ... it is what you can expect from airport food . <sssss> not that great but not terrible . <sssss> all i wanted was a simple sandwhich to take on the plane with me . <sssss> this airport does not have the best in choices , starbucks , wendys , pizza hut , etc. . <sssss> this little place is literally a kiosk in terminal c . <sssss> it is good if you are in a rush and just want something cold for later . 
3		do not go if you 're in a hurry . <sssss> service is extremely slow . 
3		it 's americanized versions of mexican food . <sssss> do n't go here if you 're looking for the real thing , only the american-washed version of the real thing . <sssss> the wait staff is usually pretty ok , but the hostesses are by far the worst . <sssss> i do n't understand how they even got jobs as the face of the restaurant/first person you see when you walk into the establishment . <sssss> they always seem to be teenage girls who are too busy talking to each other to give a damn about customers coming in . <sssss> when they do turn around to service you , they act like you 're ruining their day instead of paying them their paychecks . <sssss> :p also , if you 're under 65 i do n't recommend going during the day , it 's a senior citizens playground before happy hour . 
3		we checked this place out for drinks and thought it was pretty cool ! <sssss> good location , great atmosphere and decent drinks ! 
3		we have eaten here many times in the 7 years we have lived in qc . <sssss> we usually go during offpeak times , so it 's not busy most of the times . <sssss> the service is average , occasionally we have gotten good service here . <sssss> the food has been consistently slightly above average mexican fare . <sssss> it 's good enough that we keep coming back every couple of months over 7 years . <sssss> we like the salsas , and we almost always order the pork . 
3		nice selection of `` sandwiches '' and while enjoyable to eat i feel they could be a little more flavorful . <sssss> its a nice alternative to quiznos and subway . <sssss> * does n't serve coke products 
3		one of my fav places . <sssss> affordable , consistently good quality salads , soups and such . <sssss> it 's not gourmet , or all organic etc but a reliable place for a vegetarian when you 're in the mood to pig out with a big buffet . 
3		for all the pomp this place fails to meet some minimum expectations like clean bathrooms in the guestroom . <sssss> also , make sure you check your bill before you leave , apparently you get charged for looking at the minibar . <sssss> more properly called the arizona billmore . 
3		it 's ihop , good when nothing else is open and you want breakfast . 
3		totally a fan of the concept . <sssss> i find the theater seats to be super comfy . <sssss> still waiting to be moved by a film i see here . <sssss> so far , of the two , they were just ok . <sssss> i especially like that you do n't have to go someplace else to sit and discuss the film with your friends after . <sssss> you can just grab another $ 5 draught and get to it ! 
3		they have a great selection but the prices are what you can get at a regular sale at any department store . <sssss> if you find a really good sale at a department store you can do even better than here . <sssss> i do love how open and bright the store is . <sssss> it is very well organized , clean , and spacious . <sssss> the services is sometimes good and a lot of times indifferent . 
3		pretty much standard chinese buffet with some additional seafood items . <sssss> when i was there they had chicken feet which i felt obligated to try . <sssss> not a good move . <sssss> i 'm pretty sure they had frog legs too . <sssss> so if you 're looking for some extra adventurous food , that 's been sitting under a heat lamp for awhile you should check this place out . <sssss> the chinese food stand-bys are all represented and are n't bad , did n't try the sushi either but it looked about like what it was supposed to . <sssss> good service and decent food . <sssss> a-ok in my book . 
3		this school is ok . <sssss> i have my daughter in the pre-k 4 year old class . <sssss> her previous 3 year old class teacher was great and so is her current teacher . <sssss> they are very nice and great with the kids . <sssss> the new preschool director on the other hand , not so good . <sssss> she 's rude , impersonable , and not very friendly . <sssss> she 's never smiling . <sssss> the school does n't have a playground either . <sssss> they have what they call a `` peaceful playground '' otherwise known as , too cheap to build a playground for the kids . <sssss> save money approach , i guess . <sssss> i think kids , especially little ones , should have a playground to play on . <sssss> when i first enrolled my daughter here they even said that they were planning on building a playground . <sssss> they initially said oh yeah it will be installed next week . <sssss> a week goes by , no playground . <sssss> oh okay , next month for sure . <sssss> a month goes by , nothing . <sssss> it will be installed soon . <sssss> a whole school year has gone by and still no playground . <sssss> why lie about it ? <sssss> the only reason my daughter goes to this school is because it has been the cheapest i 've found for preschool , it 's in a convenient location , and close to her grandmas house . <sssss> once she enters kindergarten i will be removing her from the school . <sssss> also , as i walked in the other day to pick up my daughter i overheard a concerned mother at the front desk asking to speak with the principal regarding bullying . <sssss> her child was being bullied , the child had told the teacher numerous times , and the teacher did nothing about it . <sssss> sure , it 's hard to avoid sending your child to a school where there is no bullying whatsoever but the fact that the teacher 's did nothing ? <sssss> concerning . <sssss> it 's a nice school , appearance wise , but that 's because it 's brand spankin ' new . 
3		at $ 0.15 / token , who could complain . <sssss> the kids get to have fun and the adults get to spend $ 20 on a $ 5 toy they could 've bought . <sssss> just do n't eat their food . 
3		service is just ok ... nothing special ... best hummus and arnold palmers around ! 
3		came here today on the recommendation of dee at the wallpaper market , located across the street , inside creative home fabrics . <sssss> -lrb- little shout out there for dee 's business -rrb- dee says she gets so hungry when she comes in early because the delicious smell of fresh grilling meat is overwhelming . <sssss> i went , ordered lunch to go . <sssss> it was good . <sssss> steak quesadilla was soaking in grease . <sssss> i had to take a napkin and soak up the grease . <sssss> i ordered 3 steak tacos , and 3 chicken tacos . <sssss> good . <sssss> had to add a lot of salt and pepper to really enjoy them . <sssss> the crazy potato with steak was good . <sssss> i love that they have coke products , styrofoam cups and pellet ice . <sssss> love the cucumbers at salsa bar . <sssss> the place is darling . <sssss> very very clean , was packed at 12:30 pm . <sssss> lots of clean cut business people and elders -lrb- missionaries -rrb- eating here . <sssss> it had a really nice '' boutique-ee feel to it . <sssss> the background story is cute and inspiring . <sssss> the food was good and the place cute and really clean . <sssss> . <sssss> i would not drive out of my way to eat here , but would definitely return if i happen to be in the area . 
3		started out so promising ... . <sssss> . <sssss> why is it when small restaurants start out great they get comfortable and fizzle ... been here several times and each time i see and taste the decline.the gyros were great then tasted as if they 've been under the lamps all day . <sssss> why is it that the tables are always dirty and only a handful of people are seated ? <sssss> i wish i could say i 'm going back . 
3		i went there for a birthday dessert and my family ordered two pots of fondue : banana fosters and smores . <sssss> they both were too hot and tasted like they were burnt or on the process of burning . <sssss> the dippers were tasty and i honestly would have rather eaten just those without fondue . 
3		12/21/10 came in w / mom and a coworker , and we sat at the counter . <sssss> we 've heard that select sushi rolls were 1/2 off during happy hour -lrb- 3p-7p -rrb- mondays through fridays , but we saw nothing on the short menu that we wanted to try . <sssss> i decided to order the bbq bacon burger and a seaweed salad , while mom and coworker ordered seaweed salads and a rainbow roll to share . <sssss> have you ever tried a seaweed salad before ? <sssss> we have , and we 've had them from many japanese/sushi restaurants , but never have we seen them served w / carrots and cucumbers before . <sssss> until now . <sssss> we 've also never seen them without sesame seeds . <sssss> let 's hope that this was a fluke , or else i 'd question the quality of sushi that this kitchen produces . <sssss> needless to say , the seaweed salads were n't good - i took one bite and decided to pass on the salad and waited for my burger to arrive . <sssss> the other two removed the non-authentic items and ate the seaweed , even though they also did n't particularly care for them . <sssss> the rainbow sushi that came after looked very dry , so i did n't even sample it . <sssss> mom and coworker both remarked that it was tasteless and dry . <sssss> thank goodness that the burger entree was delicious ! <sssss> i ordered it with bbq sauce on the side , and to be honest , i did n't miss it . <sssss> the patty was thick and juicy , and i appreciated the crispy thick-sliced applewood-smoked bacon . <sssss> i do n't know which i liked better , the burger or the seasoned wedge fries . <sssss> these reminded me sour cream & onion potato chips - yum ! <sssss> i may go back and give happy hour sushi another try , but i would n't mind having more of those fries ! 
3		finally tried this place after hearing so much about it . <sssss> i guess it was alright , but seriously , nothing special . <sssss> the fry bread is just like a taco shell , so my fry bread with meat was like a taco with meat . <sssss> how fantastic can that be , right ? <sssss> nonetheless , not a bad place , just okay . <sssss> . 
3		overrated in my book . <sssss> not bad food , some of it was pretty good . <sssss> but , i can have much better pasta , much better to home . <sssss> the setting is very nice , though , with weathered bricks , twinkley lights and twining grape vines . 
3		dave was craving a cheeseburger sub , which i thought were nonexistent out here ; however , after a quick search on yelp we found this place and it was n't too far , only about 10 miles . <sssss> i was hoping to find that little gem , but unfortunately i did n't . <sssss> i had a single cheeseburger , i liked everything except the rocket sauce ... no matter what you call it , it 's 1000 island on all these burgers -lrb- in/out , mcd 's and every other burger place with special sauce is either straight up 1000 island or some variant of it -rrb- , and normally i like it ; however , i did not care for this particular version . <sssss> it was watery . <sssss> i did like the actual burger . <sssss> again , i 'm a lover of onion rings and i was super excited to see all the great reviews , until i actually tried them . <sssss> i did n't care for them at all . <sssss> the breading was horrible , i ate them because i was hungry ... the breading did not grow on me ! <sssss> the selection of sodas was amazing , they have an extensive menu , the prices are extremely reasonable , the service friendly , the customers eclectic , but the overall quality of the meal was just 3 stars for me . 
3		do n't hate me . <sssss> please ? <sssss> i 've been wanting to love defalcos for decades . <sssss> i just ... do n't . <sssss> their marinara is too sweet for me , and their meatballs are mushy and one dimensional and absurdly salty . <sssss> i 've got a better place to go for a meatball sub to cry for . <sssss> this check-in we got the eggplant parm , the meatball sub , the seafood salad and a basil , tomato , and mozzarella salad , and a chocolate connoli for dessert . <sssss> the eggplant parm was terrible ! <sssss> underseasoned , and it tasted like the oil it was cooked in was n't hot enough . <sssss> it was frankly , kind of gross . <sssss> major bummer ! <sssss> i ate 2 small bites aqnd was sorry that i ate the second bite . <sssss> . <sssss> the meatball sub was underwhelming and just as icky as always . <sssss> i 've learned my lesson . <sssss> never again . <sssss> the seafood salad was delicious ! <sssss> loads of dill , you could actually taste the shrimp and crab . <sssss> totally fabulous !!!! <sssss> the cannoli ? <sssss> never never never again.the chocolate coating tasted chemically . <sssss> their regular cannoli are nice though . <sssss> too bad we did n't get one . <sssss> on the plus side , their breads are all delicious , the grocery store is awesome , the wines extensive and inexpensive , and the seafood salad is the shiznit ! <sssss> overall , a solid 3 stars . <sssss> we 've learned our lesson . <sssss> next time we go , we 're getting 2 glasses of wine , 2 orders of seafood salad , splitting one of their cold subs , and getting a regular cannoli . <sssss> btw : i almost forgot . <sssss> we do love their garlic bread . <sssss> :-rrb- update : the owner sent me an extremely polite e-mail . <sssss> we have decided to give the eggplant parm another try on another day and i will bring my mom . <sssss> she is an eggplant fanatic and eggplant parm may be her favorite food . <sssss> we will update y' all when we go . 
3		we recently visited 2 days in a row since we had a visiting family member here who happens to love cracker barrel . <sssss> the food was consistent both days . <sssss> i had the french toast one day and the hashbrown casserole and bacon the next . <sssss> i did have a bite of my husband 's pancake which was super good too . <sssss> in my opinion the french toast and pancakes are the way to go when visiting . <sssss> our service was inconsistent with the first visit being great and the second being just ok . <sssss> overall it was fine . <sssss> the food and the price are ok and i will visit again . 
3		i 'm not a super frequent flier , but i fly about half a dozen times a year . <sssss> i do n't hate sky harbor , but i do n't love it either . <sssss> i flew last in the beginning of april . <sssss> the lines were manageable -lrb- i did n't check a bag -rrb- , did n't wait more than 15 minutes though security . <sssss> i 'm amazed that people can not follow directions or read signs -lrb- no , you can not take your full bottle of shampoo/toothpaste/water though security -rrb- , but that 's not the airport 's fault . <sssss> but the airport was so hot . <sssss> i always fly southwest , so terminal four . <sssss> but from the time i walked in till the time i flew out , everyone was fanning themselves . <sssss> it was about 10 degrees hotter than it should be . <sssss> and with all those bodies packed so close to each other -lrb- and not nearly enough seating -rrb- , it was really uncomfortable . <sssss> also , the wifi sucks . <sssss> yes , it 's free . <sssss> but it barely reaches terminal four . <sssss> i can usually connect to the wifi itself , but getting pages to fully load is rare . <sssss> i 'm not talking fancy stuff , but my email and facebook always time out . <sssss> food options are ok outside of security , but i 'm always afraid it will take too long to get through security , so i 've never eaten at any of them . <sssss> once past security , your choices are limited . <sssss> burger king , pizza hut , fox sports , starbucks . 
3		dined here with my customers . <sssss> it is an arizona a chain and my felafel sandwich was good . <sssss> the felafel and veggies were great but the pita bread was a bit boring and i did not eat it . <sssss> my thighs say thank you . <sssss> i like the decor and recommend trying . <sssss> the sales and wraps looked marvelous . <sssss> recommend . 
3		i purchased a light system at the utah dental association convention for $ 500 . <sssss> i have n't heard from them and wish they would send me a tracking code . <sssss> the price is right , i just wonder who else is using this light and what the customer satisfaction is like ... 
3		what the heck ?!?!?! <sssss> i went in to grab a bite . <sssss> the store was beginning to get busy and the cashier had a lot of people in line . <sssss> i ordered and was waiting for my food . <sssss> i noticed this redhead employee who was wearing a white shirt and black tie . <sssss> i assumed her to be the manager , what caught my attention was that food was sitting and this women was busy texting on her phone . <sssss> why would you text during work ?? <sssss> then i watched her finish and place the phone in her back pocket . <sssss> without walking over to wash her hands she picked up food bagged it and handed to customers . <sssss> then walked back over and started the text message again . <sssss> really ? <sssss> not only are you too focused on the texting , but also cross contamination of food . <sssss> i really do not know how clean you phone is . <sssss> i am surprised that more people did not notice it . <sssss> when it got to my food i asked that she wash her hands to pick it up or have someone else . <sssss> beware of this location . 
3		i am a little mixed on this review , as i have had mediocre steak there , and just recently , one of the best ribeyes i have ever had . <sssss> the campfire feast is a great value , and has really good entrees included . <sssss> service has always been good , from the bar , down to the wait staff . <sssss> i will definitely be back . 
3		this place has been recently renovated -lrb- as of september 2009 -rrb- to include a wal-mart grocery store . <sssss> i do n't think it qualifies as a `` supercenter '' because it lacks a mcdonald 's and a bank and a vision department and all that . <sssss> but i was pleased to be able to have an alternative for grocery shopping in the neighborhood . <sssss> after some growing pains experienced in their inventory , they finally started carrying the yakult probiotic beverage in their dairy section . <sssss> i drink this stuff daily to stay regular -lrb- become friends with your intestinal flora , i say -rrb- , and have been miffed to find that it sells for $ 3 a six-pack . <sssss> but this wal-mart carries the cheap , mexican alternative bio salud for 88 cents a six pack ! <sssss> but allow me to climb down from my gastrointestinal soapbox ... the groceries at this wal-mart are not always the best quality -lrb- e.g. the bacon i purchased was quite fatty , and the shredded parmesan was less flavorful than most -rrb- , but you can find some bargains here . <sssss> and then there 's always the rest of the store to explore for those random items you never knew you needed . 
3		i like the combination of pan dulce and breakfast or lunch burritos all in the same place . <sssss> i can take a meal to go and some pan dulce for the next day ! <sssss> the food is very tasty , not the best ive tasted , but no where near ` not good ' . <sssss> only draw back was the salsa was a lil watered down , overall , i likes , i would recommend and would go back , i give 3.5 stars . 
3		it 's not fenway , wrigley , or yankee stadium , nor was it the first retractable dome stadium , or one to serve higher grade food . <sssss> however chase field is a decent place to see a game . <sssss> it 's clean and has nice seating , and good food and beer selections . <sssss> parking is easy peazy and tickets are reasonable . <sssss> i do agree the d'back fans are pretty boring , and overall any game you attend will have a good portion of people rooting for the away team . <sssss> i do like baseball , so i may be a bit biased . <sssss> i even enjoyed a game at mcafee statdium in oakland , so maybe i am not the best stadium reviewer ; -rrb- 
3		at rita 's kitchen restaurant staff is somewhat condescending ; i got the entre size salad on a dish so small that is difficult to eat out of . <sssss> food is ok , expected . <sssss> big hang out place , bar area seems to be more popular . 
3		not much to say about there pizza . <sssss> its just ok . <sssss> there is way to many places making pizza like this and i dont understand how they are still in business . <sssss> cheap ? <sssss> i guess 
3		came here when i was out visiting some folk in the desert and thought this place was ok . <sssss> i do n't really like fish and chips but they had plenty of options for me to chose from . <sssss> i got the chicken strips and was a little disappointed . <sssss> i kind of thought that a fish and chips place would also have good strips but i was wrong . <sssss> i do n't think that they were much better than something i would get at jack n box . <sssss> i did however try one of my buddies jumbo fried shrimp . <sssss> mmmm good . 
3		the one thing that is good about this establishment is the food . <sssss> the pizza is fresh and desserts are delicious . <sssss> however , when we came here on a sunday afternoon , the service was not good . <sssss> once our order was taken they got two things wrong : we received the wrong appetizer but they insisted we ordered that item . <sssss> also , they forgot to get our dessert ready which takes 20 minutes to prepare . <sssss> so at the end of our meal , when we were ready for dessert , they had not even started yet . <sssss> if the service were better this place could easily be 4-5 stars 
3		i was treated to a mani/pedi and neck massage for mother 's day . <sssss> i liked the polish on my toes , of course my hands chipped after a day -lrb- that always happens , no matter where or who does them -rrb- , the hot towel and hot stone was nice . <sssss> the neck/shoulder massage sucked , i did n't feel relaxed or helped , i felt hurt . <sssss> even the next day , i do n't recommend it . <sssss> i paint my own toes , so i do n't think i will go back , but if i do for what ever reason , i may chose this place because they did paint my toes well and they were very nice . 
3		perhaps i picked the wrong item ... the arizona salad , but i was not a fan and it was quite spicy !! <sssss> yes there was a pepper symbol next to it as a warning , but it needs 2-3 peppers . <sssss> we also ordered the arizona sandwich -- a little bland and bread was not my favorite . <sssss> better luck next time ... 
3		silver spoon cafe is a little bistro cafe in/under the hotel san carlos . <sssss> i really want to love it , but i do n't . <sssss> i like the idea , i love the location ... i just do n't really like the food . <sssss> the couple times i 've been , something is always slightly off . <sssss> too sweet , too salty , too cold , too chewy , etc. . <sssss> the cashier boy who works in the afternoons is kind of snarky too . <sssss> . <sssss> i would give it more of a chance , but like too many other businesses in downtown , silver spoon closes its doors at 3pm and is n't open weekends . 
3		it was my first visit to wienerschnitzel and omg two words corn dog ! <sssss> it is better than the ones at the state fair . <sssss> i also had the polish dog . <sssss> i am sorry but costco 's is better . <sssss> the french fries were ok . <sssss> the best thing i had was the corn dog . 
3		dropped by this location for lunch one day . <sssss> at first glance at the sign , i thought it was an `` ertos '' restaurant ... so i was hoping to add to my list , but alas i was wrong . <sssss> anyway , back to the food ... i ordered : beans rice cheese burrito , $ 3.50 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-betos-mexican-food-mesa?select=h7c-feleuwn6jqmmytncpq#h7c-feleuwn6jqmmytncpq carne asada taco , $ 2.70 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-betos-mexican-food-mesa?select=g3gvbjkuyurbudw-htae3g#g3gvbjkuyurbudw-htae3g carnitas taco , $ 2.70 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-betos-mexican-food-mesa?select=jzz49x4o5tcsdbnz-o469w#jzz49x4o5tcsdbnz-o469w http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-betos-mexican-food-mesa?select=71hp0jejm3uhzbkwyecbpq#71hp0jejm3uhzbkwyecbpq med diet coke , $ 1.55 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-betos-mexican-food-mesa?select=pu-8lht5nskg0460_w6mea#pu-8lht5nskg0460_w6mea while i was waiting for my order , i went to the salsa bar to load up . <sssss> i saw that they had the typical green & red runny , mild salsa and some chunky spicy salsa ... yes ! <sssss> i like spicy , so i grabbed a few cups and filled them up . <sssss> slight problem though ... the cups for the salsa were the soft , paper like cups typically used for ketchup & mustard . <sssss> you 're probably wondering why that 's a problem ? <sssss> well , it 's because when you fill it up with salsa , it becomes wet and soft and very difficult to carry in your hand because it spills all over the place ... yep , it was very messy . <sssss> http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-betos-mexican-food-mesa?select=g1dj4kmtgcsb0p46kfcaha#g1dj4kmtgcsb0p46kfcaha the food came out a short while later and i started with the carne asada taco ... it is a pretty big portion for street tacos . <sssss> the portion size was the only positive though ... the meat was bland ... and the guacamole and pico de gallo that was on the taco did n't help much . <sssss> next was the carnitas taco . <sssss> this one had slight more flavor and was a little better than the carne asada ... however , it was average at best . <sssss> last but not least was the beans/rice/cheese burrito . <sssss> this was very good . <sssss> some mexican joints like these have oily brc burritos ... but not here . <sssss> there was no oil and the ingredients tasted fresh . <sssss> the tortilla was very good as well . <sssss> overall , my experience here was average ... 3 stars . <sssss> if i do come back , it would be strictly for the brc burrito . <sssss> return factor - 50 % 
3		i was looking forward to some fashion event to kick off fashion week and we brought along 2 guests to get a peek , but maybe we missed it . <sssss> although there were plenty of well dressed folks there , i had different expectations . <sssss> can never get too disenchanted with yelp though . <sssss> most things are a hit . <sssss> i did enjoy all the tasty apps that were being brought around . <sssss> one of the servers walking by our table graciously left us a bowl of edamame and even a whole tray of the butterfish sushi . <sssss> i loved each app we tried , although we did have to hunt down the sushi rolls . <sssss> nice venue , felt very swank . <sssss> and the goody bags were a cool touch . <sssss> the dj was excellent . 
3		there is no bad time for a good scoop of ice cream . <sssss> they opened just as i was finishing brunch next door so i had to give it a try . <sssss> does n't everybody have dessert with breakfast ? <sssss> the small shop is cute with several dessert choices in addition to ice cream . <sssss> the ice cream was really good -lrb- i had the vietnamese coffee -rrb- but not mind blowing great . <sssss> and i have seen wider flavor selection at a chinese buffet . <sssss> i would definitely stop if i was in walking distance but i would not make a special trip . <sssss> 3-1/2 stars . 
3		after our last disappointment i wrote to teakwoods and they invited us back ; dinner on them . <sssss> again , we ordered a couple of burgers . <sssss> this time the burgers were cooked exactly how we wanted them , seasoned nicely , the cheese was melted and the bacon was perfect . <sssss> the meal was very good this time . <sssss> now , keep in mind the manager knew we were coming in and which table we were . <sssss> so now we have to come back again to see how the service and food is without management babysitting our table . <sssss> we both hope our next time in will be just as good as the last because we both really want to like this place . 
3		the w is in a great location -lrb- minutes from great restaurants and the mall -rrb- and i found it to be very clean and modern . <sssss> the service was great and everyone was really friendly . <sssss> a few downsides : - the rooms with two beds only have full size beds - it is hard to get a lounge chair at the pool unless you arrive very early in the morning to stake out your spot or want to spend $ 25 per chair per day to reserve one -lrb- ridiculous when you are a hotel guest if you ask me -rrb- - and finally , unless you want to feel like you are in an episode of the jersey shore , you might want to skip the pool on sundays , definitely out of control and a shitshow 
3		we went out for my birthday and lou was our waiter - he was quite awkward . <sssss> we had stuffed mushroom apps that were delish and basil tomato flatbread , also good . <sssss> i ordered top shelf margaritas that were watered down and not that tasty . <sssss> their top shelf for tequila was patron silver - not impressed . <sssss> the entrees were well presented , i had the lamb with asparagus and mashed . <sssss> the mashed was superb . <sssss> the lamb was good , on the bone . <sssss> they offer small desserts that are included with your meal . <sssss> i had the pecan pie and my friend had the lime pie . <sssss> we both enjoyed . <sssss> i came back from the restroom and my candle was lit and it is awkward from lou telling me to make a wish as he had not really connected with us at all that evening . <sssss> in essence , the food was great but the service was average . <sssss> we had a better waitress in the bar area , but again , the drinks were not impressive . 
3		maybe i 've had better chinese in the past than i realized , or perhaps i ordered the wrong things , but i ca n't see giving this place five stars . <sssss> the egg rolls were too salty , the hot and sour soup was lacking in sour , the vegetable pork was bland . <sssss> it 's quick , not over priced and not over cooked . <sssss> i 'm willing to try it again . 
3		so , it 's a sandwich shop . <sssss> it has a whole weed theme to it . <sssss> ha-ha , yeah i get it . <sssss> this place does have some pro 's working in it 's favor . <sssss> biggest compliment to this place ... they have kool-aid . <sssss> on tap . <sssss> no shit . <sssss> let me repeat that . <sssss> kool-aid . <sssss> on tap . <sssss> got it ? <sssss> i had to rub my eye 's in amazement and reflect on the pure genius of who ever approved that decision . <sssss> i can only imagine opening up the tap and letting it pour all over myself , bathing in it 's elegance and beauty . <sssss> i assume this would violate a health code , so i will turn away from such behavior . <sssss> sandwiches are decent , nothing to write home to mom about , but better than your typical chain sandwich joints for a comparable price . <sssss> wo n't win any awards but has n't made me throw up . <sssss> i read a few reviews of people whining about the bread being harder than it should . <sssss> it is toasted , you know `` like the typical customer '' -lrb- and the employees -rrb- fyi , that will make the bread stiffen up some . <sssss> an elementary example of cause and effect . <sssss> takes a bit of time to get your food but it is even posted it takes a while to make a `` quality '' sandwich . <sssss> i disagree , but since they post it , the line has been drawn in the sand and their intentions are noted . <sssss> fair enough . <sssss> if you do n't want to wait , go somewhere else . <sssss> the annoying things about this place . <sssss> you order your sandwich in some sort of pot head size , joint , penner , or whatever the hell they are . <sssss> being pretty ignorant about this terminology myself , i just order a `` medium '' sandwich and they are cool with that . <sssss> the staff seems like your typical grab bag of a pothead assortment . <sssss> all shapes and sizes are represented . <sssss> the traditional hippie , the dreadlocked bandanna wearing pissed at the world guy , the pot smoking girls with bloodshot eyes and the `` huh-huh '' laugh , and the scrawny young guy laughing and smiling at nothing amusing and/or funny , like leonardo dicaprio in the movie `` what 's eating gilbert grape '' i ca n't tell if they are high or just do n't give a shit . <sssss> all right then . <sssss> i 'm not here to judge , just to eat . <sssss> there is also a huge novelty joint hanging up in the store as well . <sssss> not a lot of thought behind that , huh ? <sssss> a bunch of tacky , goofy ass pot decorations and annoying associated artifacts are also always represented . <sssss> i suppose if i smoked weed this would be like eating at a museum or something . <sssss> the tables always seem dirty but i think everyone is too high to give a shit . <sssss> plus it is always been busy when i have been in there so i 'll go ahead and give them a pass on this . <sssss> in all fairness , if this place was terrible i 'd never come back , but i will . <sssss> seems like i still grab lunch here every 2-3 months or so . <sssss> i 'll still keep coming back , even if i have to deal with the whole weed thing . <sssss> goddamn hippies . 
3		not a bad place . <sssss> it 's located off the 202 loop near the bass pro shops . <sssss> i 'm a west coast girl so i 've never heard of this place before until i saw it on my way to home depot that is in the same area . <sssss> i had asked a friend about it and he swore it had the best breakfast he 's ever had . <sssss> clearly he 's never been to black bear diner ! <sssss> went on a sunday ... biiiig mistake . <sssss> as we were waiting to be seated , my friend and i realized we were n't the following ... a -rrb- religious enough -lrb- it was sunday , so i 'll cut some slack on that -rrb- b -rrb- old enough c -rrb- tacky enough d -rrb- cranky enough my eyes . <sssss> omyeyes ! <sssss> i was blinded by the sequins and dazzled from the home bedazzled shirts . <sssss> omyeyes ! <sssss> i swear , everyone was over 60 and complaining about their meals . <sssss> i was surrounded by senior citizens who bitched and complained then threatened to not pay for their meals . <sssss> personally , i felt like they were scamming the place . <sssss> i know customer service is a thankless job , but sometimes customers are way too cheap and should n't be eating out . <sssss> breakfast was n't so bad , but i found it incredibly bland and laden with salt . <sssss> within an hour of eating there i was * parched * . <sssss> their `` sourdough '' pancakes did n't remind me of sourdough in the slightest . <sssss> their scrambled eggs seemed to have been made from liquid eggs , solidifying my belief that i 'm too young for this establishment . <sssss> the only true highlight were the corn muffins that were brought out while we waiting . <sssss> yum . <sssss> i felt so cheap and tacky walking through home depot after while guzzling 4 bottles of water . <sssss> yes , i paid for them . <sssss> the fluid retention from my salt intake was enough to make me think they had some msg in their food . <sssss> long review short ? <sssss> if you like salty food and cantankerous seniors , this place is for you . 
3		i ordered chicken wings to go and it took forever . <sssss> we had been the first in line when we entered and it took over 25 minutes for our food . <sssss> so , obviously super slow service . <sssss> they charge you if you want more than one container of sauce . <sssss> really sad and pathetic celery with my wings . <sssss> the wings tasted decent . <sssss> i do n't know what the big rave about this place was though . 
3		had the pizza and its ok for something quick . <sssss> they do have pretty good lunch specials and the service was good . 
3		food and service are pretty good , but make sure you have plenty of time , as the place is always packed and there is a wait . <sssss> apps are pretty good -lrb- love the calamari -rrb- and salads are awesome . <sssss> i am not a fan of the 45min wait for a deep-dish pizza , but the thin crust i had was pretty solid and i 'm not a thin crust person . <sssss> all in all , the food is good , but this place is too much of a time commitment , so i probably wo n't go very often . <sssss> i 've tried it 2x and been there over 1.5 hrs both times . 
3		food is good and ther service is pretty quick . <sssss> that being said there is not a self serve salsa bar ... that was a little disappointing . <sssss> they are going to have to get used to me asking for 4-5 salsas . <sssss> ha 
3		this place has gone downhill since opening a couple of years back . <sssss> sure its better than bevmo and its an alcoholics paradise , and love their ironic radio commercials , but the staff are not as abundant or as helpful since they first opened . <sssss> also , was very very excited to try their growlers on tap . <sssss> went in , the menu had about 6 on tap , and i was ready to tap that be-atch , went to the kind of nice man -lrb- he got irritated when i asked him `` what 's good ? '' -rrb- <sssss> and he said they only have one beer left on tap ? <sssss> huh ? <sssss> wtf alert ? <sssss> so i got a half growler of the only thing they had left , it was some kind of dark ipa , not my first choice for sure . <sssss> i asked , when will they fill the taps so i can come back and try again . <sssss> `` ai n't rightly sure '' he said . <sssss> huh ? <sssss> ok , well what 's the alcohol percent in the beer i just bought -lrb- as they are n't marked on the chalk board menu ? -rrb- <sssss> , `` mmmmmmm he said '' '' not rightly sure ... '' . <sssss> hey , the andy griffith show called , they want their goober back ... look , if your going to have a cool growler to go thing , please train the staff and keep the things filled . <sssss> total wine , more like total whine ... . <sssss> its gone downhill for sure . <sssss> update : 12/26/12 : went back , they had all taps good but one . <sssss> still no one knew the alcohol content of any of the beers on tap ?? <sssss> i think a staff meeting is in order , no ? 
3		pros : clean , quiet , front desk friendly . <sssss> cons : provider spent less then 2 min . <sssss> office is cold , so bring something warm to wear . <sssss> there was 1 person in front of me and it still took over 45 min to be seen . <sssss> i can hear people in the rooms surrounding me but no doctor . <sssss> she did n't seem knowledgeable about one of the meds i take which is an immune-suppressor . <sssss> i could tell she was pretending she knew but had no clue and was quick to exit the room . 
3		i can walk to calabria 's from my office , so i have probably # 1 eaten too many of their subs and # 2 become partial to the owner . <sssss> the owner 's a nice guy , i swear ... really . <sssss> ok , somewhere underneath that gruff exterior and short greeting , he 's a nice guy . <sssss> tell him your a boston red sox fan and he 'll lighten up . <sssss> and know what you want to order , because lunch time -lrb- the rush hour -rrb- is tough . <sssss> you can call ahead too which works great for them and you . <sssss> for office meetings , this is a fantastic people-pleaser . <sssss> almost everyone can find something on the menu , however , meat-eaters will be more satisfied with both the selection and the actual food . <sssss> the specialty orange and lemon sodas , the sides of olives , cold desserts , and coffee round out the menu . <sssss> their veggie sandwich -lrb- with cheese -rrb- is what every vegetarian hates -- a boring , tasteless sub . <sssss> my advice to making it better is do n't forget your toppings . <sssss> calabria 's only has a few things like lettuce and tomato that come standard on their subs , so add , add , add . <sssss> toppings do n't cost you anything and trust me , adding pepperocinis to that veggie sub can mean the difference between happy lunch time and sad ! <sssss> their eggplant parm is decent , though not as good as other places around the valley . <sssss> for sure , if you love cheese , the caprese will be your saving grace sub . <sssss> besides these subs or a salad , as a vegetarian , your options are limited -lrb- and were n't that good to begin with -rrb- . <sssss> so , for vegetarians , search elsewhere for the best eats ... for all the rest of you meat-eating folks , enjoy your italian with a side of sox . 
3		we 're not experts in bbq by any means - proven by the fact that we did n't realize there was extra bbq sauce available until we were pretty much done with our food . <sssss> i had a chicken sandwich and she had a pulled pork sandwich . <sssss> she thought the pork was a little dry without the extra bbq sauce but she liked the smoked flavor . <sssss> the chicken had some sauce already on it and was pretty good . <sssss> i would have liked the extra bbq sauce on it . <sssss> for a side we both had the cheesy potatoes , which were not that great . <sssss> they had a bit of heat -lrb- spiciness -rrb- to them . <sssss> the food is affordable . 
3		3 stars because there is no one that can not find something they like on this menu ! <sssss> -2 stars because it makes you remember why yelpers like local business . <sssss> this place is overrun by teenage yuppies paying their way through prada with a part time waiting job . <sssss> other than that , this place is really good ; lighting is awesome and actually had a co-worker explain that the lighting ` calmed ' him . <sssss> if lighting in a crowded restaurant can do that , it has succeeded in that way . <sssss> food was n't overcooked , but portions were way to large-no way even the men in my party could finish theirs . <sssss> if we not glutton out on fried macaroni and eat smaller portion sizes , perhaps we can solve this little obesity issue . 
3		nothing extraordinary here . <sssss> seated our large group outside in the cold when the interior restaurant was empty . <sssss> food was decent , same as any other in this chain . 
3		great microbrews . <sssss> descent service . <sssss> no way burgers are 1/2 pound . <sssss> bacon was burnt . <sssss> calimari appetiser was delicious . <sssss> burger came out overcooked . <sssss> the guy who brought replacement had attitude problem . 
3		wow ! <sssss> everything is broken up into little pockets of color coded amazingness . <sssss> it was n't terribly busy and despite about 5-6 different ladies working there , i was n't greeted once or asked if i needed help with anything . <sssss> color coding must be more important then customer service . <sssss> the products are great , the shopping experience not so much . 
3		this was my first thai food experience and i have to admit that it was pretty tasty ! <sssss> i was expecting the typical small , cramped chinese-like restaurant where they 're mean to you and you feel scared for even asking for a fork . <sssss> but this place was so nice on the inside , green decor , nice paintings on the wall , pretty lights everywhere . <sssss> i 'd even go there on a date . <sssss> i ordered the most thai dish there , pai tei , and i really enjoyed . <sssss> never had tofo before and i ate it all up . <sssss> my friends had different dishes like yellow curry and from what i gathered everyone was satisfied . <sssss> what impressed me the most was the food kept for like 2 days afterward and when i reheated it , still delish ! 
3		this was my first time here . <sssss> we sat in the bar and caught the tail end of happy hour . <sssss> apparently that have complementary hors d'oeuvres , although i did not have any . <sssss> we had a few cocktails and ordered some salmon and yellow tail sashimi and nigri . <sssss> i love good salmon and i must say their salmon is pretty good . <sssss> the yellow tail sashimi was cut too thick for my liking . <sssss> my biggest complaint was the smell of the restaurant . <sssss> it smelled like a mix of disinfectant and cheap cologne . <sssss> it was really strong and made me a little sick to my stomach ... 
3		********** this time we did n't do carry-out ********* definitely better ... ... when you eat there . <sssss> this place is like pei wei ... ... very large chunks of meat . <sssss> vegatables ... . <sssss> never ... . <sssss> . <sssss> just like pei wei ... ... their priceless . <sssss> warning : hot tea is available for $ 2.00 ********* brown rice instead of white ... ... also $ 2.00 ********* the soups are terrible . 
3		food is decent and the fun factor is better . <sssss> when most of the good ticket games are more than 3 credits , which is about a dollar , having fun here can cost alot of dough . 
3		step between asian fast food and something a little nicer , and for that it 's okay . <sssss> the teriyaki sauce is too salty for my taste , but the caramel chicken and thai dynamite chicken are both pretty good . <sssss> the crab wontons always seem to be cold and not at all crispy by the time i get them , but the hot and sour soup has a good level of flavor . <sssss> i tend to get takeout from here as opposed to eating in the restaurant , and it 's always ready on time . 
3		most of what 's posted in these comments is 100 % dead on . <sssss> the bar/drinks are great . <sssss> show prices are very reasonable . <sssss> the speakers inside leave a lot to be desired , we went to see pinback last night and the music actually sounded better outside of the venue , through the door , than it did inside . <sssss> security was n't so bad , i did n't have to take off my shoes and my wife did n't even get the pat-down . <sssss> overall it 's somewhere in the middle for me . <sssss> i 've been to far better and far worse places for concerts . <sssss> i 'd go back , but only for a band i really , really want to see . 
3		great beer and the ambiance is nice too . <sssss> but over priced food , took long to bring are orders and the pizzas were barely warm , not hot . <sssss> my sons hamburger was undercooked and just barely warm . <sssss> i guess our food was sitting for a while some where . <sssss> if i go again it would be during their lunch specials . <sssss> ehh . 
3		good food , great drinks , lovely servers , not happy with the change on the chees plate none the less love it there relaxed enjoyable fun 
3		wanted to give this place a try as the newest breakfast place in scottsdale and was not impressed at all . <sssss> three adults one child $ 48.00 . <sssss> i ordered the biscuits and gravy with three eggs -lrb- medium -rrb- the eggs came cold with hard yolks . <sssss> the gravy was good as i like alot of pepper however the potatos were also hard and you could tell they had been cooked some time ago and then overcooked in an attempt to reheat . <sssss> i actually pick one up and dropped it on the table and it bounced like a marble . <sssss> my daughter had the french toast and stated that it was good although it too came cold . <sssss> we were there at 10am on december 12 and it was not even 25 % full yet our food was very sub par . <sssss> if anyone thinks this place is a standout they are simply mistaken even the hard wooden benches and decor are a copy of the good egg . <sssss> i found no feel of home cooking in this place and will certainly not be back anytime soon . <sssss> on a positive note the service was decent to bad the cooks could n't team up . <sssss> update : i originally gave this place 2 stars however my wife went here a couple days ago and really enjoyed the food so to be fair i am adding a star and will give them another chance . <sssss> she said the food was fast , fresh and the service was good . <sssss> ill let you know how it goes . 
3		i love starbucks and have high expectations for my experience . <sssss> the register partner was great , i give him a 5 . <sssss> he was friendly and nice even though a bunch of people just walked in . <sssss> the redhead that seemed to be in charge was a little tense . <sssss> she told the barista 5 times that the java chip frappuccino gets drizzle . <sssss> she seemed a little irritated with her for forgetting . <sssss> the barista asked if the customer wanted the drizzle and they were adamant that they did . <sssss> she put the drizzle on the drink . <sssss> the redhead continued to tell her that the drinks with chips get drizzle . <sssss> i tried to be nice to the redhead and asked about her store . <sssss> she was irritated and bitchy . <sssss> i know it is frustrating to train people when your store is a little busy but you are in the people business serving coffee . <sssss> try to remember that , mean redhead lady . <sssss> starbucks may need to remind her of the core purpose , `` to create an uplifting experience that enriches people 's daily lives '' . <sssss> enter at your own risk ! 
3		flo 's is good , not great . <sssss> killer lunch specials on saturdays , 5 bucks . <sssss> it 's loud in there , and the service is ok . <sssss> ca n't get too excited about this place , but it is right around the corner from where we live , the only bonus for me . 
3		i needed some new table cloths and figured i 'd give it a shot since i was in the area . <sssss> if i 'd these had been around when i was first moving out on my own , i might have shopped here quite a bit . <sssss> really , really great prices on most things . <sssss> towels , blankets , drapes , table cloths - you know , linens . <sssss> but of course they also had some other household things like candles , and other decorative items for the home . <sssss> all relatively well priced . <sssss> here 's the thing - i did n't see anything high quality . <sssss> most of it was fine . <sssss> totally fine , and even nice if i was just starting out . <sssss> and , maybe fine if it 's not a big thing . <sssss> i bought some solid colored table cloths there , but the next day i found much nicer ones at target for about $ 1 more each . <sssss> i was willing to pay the $ 1 more for the nicer product , even though it would just end up with wine , cranberry , and some other mystery stains on it just like my other ones after a few years . <sssss> anna 's employees were really great about the return - which can be the real sign of class . <sssss> if you 're looking for egyptian cotton towels , go elsewhere . <sssss> something simple ? <sssss> give it a shot . 
3		i do n't get what the big deal is . <sssss> it 's just an automated car wash that does n't really do a good job , and you still have the whole interior to worry about . <sssss> there are no sprays to clean the interior of your car unless you want cheap ones from a vending machine . <sssss> i would n't go here if it 's been a while since your last wash . <sssss> i paid more to get tires cleaned but there 's still dirt and mud everywhere . <sssss> it 's passable if you just want a quick exterior rinse . <sssss> the driers do n't do a good job and you 'll get water stains if you do n't have towels to wipe up afterward . <sssss> i will say it rained the day after my wash , and i got a free wash without hassle . 
3		i booked this hotel last minute for my stay in casa grande . <sssss> i only stayed for one night & total came out to be like $ 75-ish . <sssss> the front desk receptionist was really polite and courteous ! <sssss> they offer breakfast as well & it 's a pretty good selection ! <sssss> i 'm a little picky on the type of beds because i 'm so used to my bed at home that the ones they offered at comfort inn were a bit too hard for me . <sssss> also , i do n't know if i 'm allergic or anything but as i slept in the bed , my skin felt itchy . <sssss> i 'm not sure if they use hypo-allergic detergent to wash their sheets but next time , i 'll ask to find out . <sssss> other than that , i really love their customer service ! 
3		i have really enjoyed tommy v 's the past 3 trips to scottsdale . <sssss> they are located a block or two out of the main old town area toward 101 . <sssss> the pastas and entrees are great as are the salads for lighter fare . <sssss> i wanted to eat/watch a sports event and tommy v 's bar made for an excellent location as the food quality is better than most spots with televisions in old town scottsdale . <sssss> i like the consistency and quiet ambiance 
3		i really want to like this place a lot more than i actually do . <sssss> the ice cream is good -lrb- not the best in town . -rrb- <sssss> the coffee is good -lrb- not even close to the best in town . -rrb- <sssss> the room is comfortable - but nothing that stands out as a draw for me . <sssss> the novelties -lrb- ice cream sandwiches , chocolate bananas , several flavors of chocolate covered bacon , etc. -rrb- are pretty cool . <sssss> i 've been in a few times -lrb- mostly surrounding the plans of a dear friend 's now ten year old daughter who loves the place -rrb- - and am sure i will be back in the future , but i do n't see pink spot being a part of the heavy rotation list . 
3		good place to start off if in tempe . <sssss> the look outside and inside remind me of a pearl street bar and brewery in buffalo , ny . <sssss> good food , good drinks . <sssss> has home brew beer . <sssss> the waitress was nice and friendly . <sssss> made you feel special . <sssss> prices were reasonable . <sssss> its about a 7 of 10 in my view . 
3		have tried it a few times and definitely good chinese food . <sssss> very good and just what i 'd expect -lrb- my point of reference is sf chinatown -rrb- . <sssss> tried the different dumplings and as others note - they are fresh ! <sssss> you can actually watch them making these items . <sssss> unfortunately i 'm not that into the steamed ones as they are too much dough for my palette . <sssss> but that 's my preference , nothing wrong with the food . <sssss> pot stickers are great . <sssss> i need to check out a few more menu items in order to say it 's great . <sssss> some regulars had an interesting dish that caused me some entrée envy - definitely gon na give that a shot next time . <sssss> place is not huge but i 've never had a problem getting a seat . <sssss> food is at least 4 stars but service leaves a bit to be desired , so rating 3 stars . <sssss> waitstaff i 've had just do n't even bother to try and connect -lrb- except to the regulars i mentioned - they got a lot of attention -rrb- . <sssss> and our last waiter 's apron looked like he was in the back cooking ! <sssss> would show up , slap our dishes down and then disappear . <sssss> did n't look like it was isolated to us as i noticed a few other tables having a similar problem getting his attention . <sssss> all-in-all it is a good place . <sssss> much better than most any other chinese i 've tried in the chandler area . <sssss> yeah , that 's not saying much , i know ... 
3		a little messy and watch out if you go on the weekends , it is super busy and those people are sharks trying to get deals . <sssss> i loved their purse selection and the fact that they had a large collection of betsey johnson . <sssss> the shoe selection was just okay . <sssss> great store if you like shopping at nordstrom or saks . 
3		scale of 1-10 -lrb- multiple visits -rrb- : 8 food 8 service 8 atmosphere 7 value 
3		right now this patio is dope because it faces west and the weather is beautiful . <sssss> the beers are decent , but a little heavy on the az beers . <sssss> i 'd like to see as many az beers along but a larger selection of beers then . <sssss> i really like the papago coffee beer being available there . <sssss> the service is good as well , my server was very helpful and accomodated us in everyway . <sssss> i agree with some of the other reviews about the inside atmosphere ; its not so enticing . <sssss> food is good , could be alot better with the crowd they draw in though . <sssss> they could do more local meat and veg like st. francis . 
3		ya 'll know what mcdonald 's is , yar bugger . <sssss> if you 've absolutely got to have your mayo and fried food fix , this mcd 's will suffice . <sssss> it 's average . <sssss> it 's not a stay-away-at-all-costs mcd 's , and it 's not the superstar mcd 's that i 'm sure exists somewhere . <sssss> it 's new-ish and still in good shape . <sssss> nice people . <sssss> no kiddie play area . <sssss> comical dual drive-through , one of whose lanes is blocked off half the time , probably to prevent the drive-through rage that ensues when the person in the next lane cuts you off when it was `` your turn '' . 
3		it 's a ups store . <sssss> i had to ship something . <sssss> i walk in , they weigh it , tell me the charge for various services , and i pick the cheapest -lrb- and slowest , of course -rrb- . <sssss> no muss , no fuss . <sssss> in , out , done . <sssss> no complaints . <sssss> they also have shipping supplies , but i did n't need any so ca n't really comment . 
3		i decided to give this place a whirl yesterday on my lunch about 5pm from work the space was nice open airy the staff from front of the house to the wait staff all were very friendly linens on the tables as well as linen napkins the only thing was the menu was a little lack luster the appetizer selection was fair . <sssss> hummus , tzatziki , served w/flat bread , selection of olives a couple of pork belly selections i had the lamb burger i ordered medium it was served a more rare but was still good the did offer some higher priced entrees and there were other selections of burgers and sandwiches thus the name gastro pub they had some good beers on tap 
3		*** keep your credit card receipt and watch your statement after your visit here . <sssss> unfortunately -lrb- like a few other scottsdale locations -rrb- they either over charge -lrb- i.e. your credit card receipt says one thing and your card statement says another -rrb- or charge your card multiple times . <sssss> it 's old town scottsdale so the ` scene ' is typical of many of the bars in the area . <sssss> we met up with some friends who had already claimed an outside/patio table for 6 , the 2 of us made 8 so we sat at the end of the table . <sssss> service was doing what they could to get through the throngs of people , but we were left thirsty and wondering , more times than not , where was our server . <sssss> the saving grace was the company we were with and the dj was playing some pretty fresh mixes . <sssss> -lsb- yeah i am a sucker for a good dj . -rsb- <sssss> the food looked good and the menu was unique . <sssss> if you are looking for a little fun and a typical days worth of calories , they have these adult shakes mixed with booze , ice cream , favorite kids breakfast cereal favorites and other stuff . <sssss> while i can not personally caloric-ally afford the whole shake it may be fun to try if treated as a shared desert between a few people at a table . 
3		i have been to the keg at this location many times . <sssss> great for happy hour and bar food -- the nachos are fantastic as are the loaded spring rolls -- but their steaks and other sides are too inconsistent to justify the price . <sssss> dinner could be great or absolutely mediocre , not really a gamble you want to take on $ 30 - $ 40 per person . <sssss> my boyfriend and i just dropped over tonight $ 100 on steaks , mashed potatoes , shrimp , asparagus , and mushrooms . <sssss> the steaks were okay , nothing great . <sssss> cooked correctly but lacking flavor . <sssss> we ordered two filet mignon steaks wrapped in bacon cooked to medium so they should have been delicious . <sssss> the mashed potatoes tasted weird and the asparagus was n't cooked correctly -lrb- odd since it takes like five minutes to boil asparagus -rrb- . <sssss> i did n't want to bother the server since in the past when i have had issues with my steak -- like being rare when i asked for medium -- they sloppily try to correct it . <sssss> our server , chris , was great . <sssss> he deserved a great tip . <sssss> it 's the kitchen that is weird . <sssss> i wo n't come back here for steak , rather try ocean prime for the slight price increase . <sssss> however , the bar area is great for a casual bite and some drinks . <sssss> happy hour is great . <sssss> they have yummy specialty cocktails like the miami haze which is very refreshing and you will be tipsy after two :-rrb- the bar is relaxing with flat panels . <sssss> i love coming here for nachos and a blue moon on a weekday after work . 
3		food is ok and very consistent . <sssss> stay with the burritos or enchiladas and you should be ok . <sssss> do n't care for the quesadilla much , it is a very cheap cheese they use . 
3		i have always enjoyed this flancer 's especially their match with hatch , verde turkey and bacon/salmon sandwich . <sssss> my last visit this week was surprisingly not as good as it had been in the past . <sssss> my verde turkey was on a much smaller bun and there was very little green chile mayo on it . <sssss> my fruit cup had maybe 3 strawberries sliced very thin . <sssss> my husband 's match with hatch was also on a smaller bun and a smaller amount of green chile . <sssss> our server was attentive and kind , but service was slow . <sssss> a little disappointed . <sssss> i hope it was just a fluke . <sssss> we 've been faithful customers for years . <sssss> left us wondering what changed . 
3		eh ? <sssss> not impressed , i came years ago and comparing quality i can see standards are fleeting . <sssss> i ordered 3 sushi rolls and i can say im not impressed , all came out promptly however the third was an eel variety that actually had bones in it . <sssss> after my first bite and attempt to save my esophagus i was turned off and could n't finish anything . <sssss> . <sssss> for being 8-9 on a friday i was disappointed there we 're more empty tables than not . <sssss> . <sssss> saving grace saki comes with every beer ? <sssss> yes please !! <sssss> this may have been my last horrah -lrb- sp ? -rrb- <sssss> for scottsdale dining for some time . <sssss> . 
3		overrated . <sssss> the concept is great , it 's the execution that is lacking . <sssss> jerk chicken was nowhere near spicy enough , jade chicken was too sweet . <sssss> i want to like this place , but it did n't really do it for me . 
3		i 've only flown in and out of pheonix airport through southwest , so i 've only been in one section of this airport - but it is n't that great . <sssss> the food choices are slim and none are fab - i mean , really what airport had fab food - wait dfw does ! <sssss> anyway - the sky harbor does have is a great view and decently clean restrooms . 
3		the location is stupid , it is in the middle of a weird mall type place with a patio underneath an overpass . <sssss> it reminded me of las vegas . <sssss> the beer list was alright . <sssss> the food was decent for the price . <sssss> the hostesses were nice girls . <sssss> the waiter had some beer knowledge . <sssss> i still felt like i was in a weird place though . <sssss> something about it . <sssss> like a bw3 , but nicer . 
3		the beer is nice and cold , our server is super ! <sssss> otherwise i would not make the trip . <sssss> our bread was terribly dry and our steaks way over done . <sssss> in addition the shrimp was too salty and the ahi dry . <sssss> it was such a surprise as this is one of or favorite places ! <sssss> the manager was very receptive to our feedback . 
3		i placed an order here with the last round of groupon and got a dozen cupcakes as a mothers day gift . <sssss> i placed my order about a week ahead of time and worked out a pick up time for the following sat . <sssss> the morning of i received a call saying they were out of 2 of the flavors i had picked so i 'd need to pick some replacements . <sssss> i called back and left a message on their machine stating what i would like . <sssss> i was a little disappointed because i was really looking forward to trying the lemon cupcake and it seemed odd that they were out even though i had put my order a week prior . <sssss> when i went they were very busy and i had to wait a bit . <sssss> when it was my turn they seemed to have difficulty locating my order when they did they made no mention of being out of the 2 flavors so i told them about the phone call and then they realized that they were short 2 cupcakes . <sssss> if i did n't speak up i would have left 2 cupcakes short ! <sssss> the cupcakes were delicious and got rave reviews from my family , just a little rocky on the customer service end of things . <sssss> i certainly go back though . 
3		review is for the coffee shop side , not the bar which was not open yet . <sssss> friendly service , coffee was flavorful and quite hot , and there was ample seating on either side of the place . <sssss> parking was thin but there were few patrons anyway , so it was n't much of an issue . <sssss> i would easily stop in here on future visits up to cave creek . 
3		pretty good stuff for fast food . <sssss> better than most 
3		winco does not accept credit cards and we have observed many people arrive at the checkout only to find out they must use cash or debit cards.they do have a sign inside the front door but the title at the top says credit card services . <sssss> they then have a list of polices following . <sssss> when most people arrive at winco for the first time , they are overwhelmed by everything they see . <sssss> they are not looking for a sign that tells them how they must pay for their groceries ! <sssss> this puts a customer in an embarrassing spot as others are usually waiting in line behind them . <sssss> i understand why winco has the policy , i just think they should make sure their customers are aware of it before they arrive at the checkout . 
3		one of my favorite locations because it is conveniently located across from my work building . <sssss> the parking is good - even better for me since i can walk . <sssss> the concessions are cheap - $ 4 for a hot dog or soda . <sssss> a combo pack of a hot dog , drink and popcorn for $ 11 . <sssss> the views are good and provides good access to players if you want to try for an autograph . <sssss> as another reviewer pointed out , there is no outfield grass , which is a disappointment . <sssss> another thing that is down is the feeling in your ass after sitting on the metal bleacher style seats down the left field line - but for $ 7 , good parking , nice location and cheap concessions , i am a fan . 
3		the sign says `` and grill '' not so . <sssss> just a bar , no food . <sssss> so once you get past that your good to go . <sssss> its really a big place , pool tables , pin ball machine , the usual bar games . <sssss> the drinks are well made and fairly priced . <sssss> do n't expect anything with an umbrella , this is n't that type of bar , and i like that about them . <sssss> it 's not flashy , maybe even a little grimy , it 's just right for a neighborhood dive bar , exactly where you want to go when you really do n't feel the need to get dressed up for a beer . 
3		it has been awhile since i reviewed mucho gusto . <sssss> i always used to come for lunch and was never disappointed so thought it would be a good place to meet a friend for drinks and a little food after work . <sssss> it was alright ... the service was actually pretty bad . <sssss> i did hear the waitress serving the table next to us that they were short staffed so i guess i can cut them a little slack . <sssss> beyond that though the food was not that memorable this time either and my dinner companion agreed :-rrb- . <sssss> does n't mean that i wont come back i will give them another shot sometime soon :-rrb- . 
3		our second venture out in restaurant week brought us to tqla . <sssss> it is a large restaurant -lrb- maybe it was something else before tqla ? -rrb- <sssss> not sure . <sssss> anyway , it is hard to miss , very prominent on val vista in front of the shopping center . <sssss> it was 7:30 on a tuesday night , but the place was pretty much deserted . <sssss> to the right was a very large bar area with just a few patrons , and to the left was the dining area ... with only 3 tables seated . <sssss> the hostess immediately seated us , and explained the 2 menus . <sssss> we told her we were here for restaurant week and she said `` cool '' and left . <sssss> we looked over the menu and made our choices . <sssss> our server came over -lrb- did n't tell us her name ... this is the second time this week ... which is odd -rrb- she was sweet and attentive , though , and asked us if we wanted a tequila ` fight ' we said no , but we wanted a pitcher of the house margaritas . <sssss> she brought us chips -lrb- light , warm and crisp -rrb- and 2 kinds of salsa -lrb- green and red -rrb- both were good , but only about 2 tablespoons in each tiny dish . <sssss> we had to ask for refills 3 times . <sssss> the margaritas were a big disappointment . <sssss> i was expecting something spectacular for a tequila bar , but they were way sweet and no way we could taste the tequila . <sssss> we did n't finish the pitcher -lrb- and not because we felt the alcohol at all ! -rrb- <sssss> things got better with the appetizers . <sssss> my spicy crab cakes were delicious , and a meal in themselves ! <sssss> the spouse had the ceviche , which he said was fine , but a lot more veggies than seafood . <sssss> my entree : the pumpkin crusted salmon was very good , cooked to perfection . <sssss> it was supposed to come with green chili mashed potatoes , but came with rice instead -lrb- ? -rrb- <sssss> i was so full from the chips and crab cakes , i took most of it home anyway . <sssss> spouse had the carne asada , which he really liked ! <sssss> he said it was well cooked and seasoned . <sssss> dessert was a chocolate and coffee flan for me -lrb- yum ! -rrb- <sssss> and blueberry cheesecake for him -lrb- just ok -rrb- it was pricey -lrb- about $ 100 -rrb- for southwestern food and was good , but not great . <sssss> this is quite a drive for us , so we probably wo n't be back unless we are in the area . <sssss> i hope this restaurant makes it ... and hopefully they pack the place on weekends ! 
3		coffee is ok , people nice . <sssss> always desolate , though . 
3		i mostly go to this subway in ahwatukee due to the location and proximity to my home . <sssss> the staff whom i generally see the same members of , have always been friendly and the service is usually pretty good except when you get those annoying customers who act like they 've never eaten a sub before . <sssss> overall , not too shabby . 
3		this place was ok and was your typical sports bar , nothing special . <sssss> we checked in through yelp and got a free irish nacho voucher which was awesome ! <sssss> the chips they use are so delicious . <sssss> they taste like freshly made potato chips . <sssss> the inferno burger was not spicy at all and the name was totally deceiving and inaccurate . <sssss> the boneless wings were good but the chicken pieces were kinda dinky and the hottest sauce was not very hot but the flavor was more flavorful than the ordinary buffalo got sauce . <sssss> the service was good , nothing to complain about there . <sssss> overall it was just ok . 
3		met some friends there friday night 7 of us all together my wife showed up about 6ish to secure a table for us they all showed about 7 ishowed at 8 when i arrived they had ordered a pizza which i had a bite of which seamed pretty tasty i ordered a ceaser which was a plate with the romane and a side of average dressing ... boring and a side of red bellpepper humus which i think was 695 and not a big portion but fairly tasty my wife had a ruben which she said was fair ... . <sssss> but there beer selection was crazy extensive from tap to bottles everybody said our server was good and attentive i found her no fun just sort of dead pan but she was attentive 
3		when stepping into the open and contemporary space at iruna , one gets a small taste of barcelona . <sssss> exposed brick is on one wall , covered with abstract art which is something one can see throught the city . <sssss> wooden beams run across the exposed ceilings . <sssss> a wall mural depicting `` la seu '' cathedral brings the concept home . <sssss> we started the tasting adventure with their signature `` ginger limonata '' -lrb- sky ginger vodka , muddled with candied ginger , fresh lemons , lemonade , and sierra mist -rrb- and a red sangria -lrb- wonderful bouquet and spicy taste with its 5 different types of brandy , still spanish wine , oranges , lemons , limes , and apples -rrb- next came the chilled vegetable soup , `` gazpacho '' which has a tart flavor and is very robust for being a chilled soup . <sssss> not my cup of soup ... however , what followed after made up for it completely . <sssss> possibly my favorite item on the menu was the bacon wrapped bleu cheese and date , a gorgeous flavor combination . <sssss> the taste barometer went down a notch again with the chistorra - a spanish chorizo braised in cider with crisp baby artichokes . <sssss> perhaps it was the way the chorizo is prepared , but it was too dry and too spicy . <sssss> the smokey flavor would indicate that the sausage had been smoked , explaining why it was so dry - i think the chorizo wanted a partner with more flavor , not the artichoke . <sssss> other menu items that were sampled were the toast with asparagus and romesco sauce , serrano ham , as well as the roasted eggplant with tomato , onion , and peppers . <sssss> seafood paella with shrimp , mussels , and calamari was also on the menu , though something was lacking with the flavor . <sssss> the highlight of this tasting experience were the patatas bravas -lrb- a crunchy , well seasoned potato with paprika -rrb- and the cauliflower in parsley broth -lrb- huge fan !!! -rrb- <sssss> these were two menu items that i sorely missed when sol y sambra closed its doors at market street . <sssss> now , luckily , the tapas are back . <sssss> there are many more items of note on their menu , many of them seafood and beef . <sssss> our particular visit was part of an event where a selection of items from their menu were provided for sampling . <sssss> we will return to explore all of the flavors iruna has to offer . 
3		visiting tempe for the week , and after watching the episode of man v food for this place , i have been wanting to try it out . <sssss> got there and split an original slider dish with my brother , 3 sliders with brisket and the potato pancake -lrb- which just takes like a hashbrown , was expecting more , maybe a little more crispiness -rrb- . <sssss> and we also upgraded to the delicious onion straws and it came with a tasty gravy and i think also some chipotle , which i could n't stop eating . <sssss> $ 11.99 + $ 2.99 for the onion straws tried some hot pastrami on sourdough sliced bread , it was ... eh . <sssss> i thought i read that the pastrami was supposed to be really good but i might have read wrong or something . <sssss> i guess we found out the pastrami was steamed later , so thats why the pastrami had a weird texture and not too much flavor , but oh well . <sssss> came with choice of potato salad or coleslaw . <sssss> $ 7.99 also tried some lovey 's oreo cheesecake just for the hell of it . <sssss> the temperature was cool , i prefer it colder . <sssss> but not bad . <sssss> on the menu it was $ 5.25 , but they charged us $ 4.95 . <sssss> also came some pickles . <sssss> the service was nice and quick . <sssss> all in all , decent food , sliders were the best part , great service , i probably wo n't be back since i 'm only here for a week , but at least i can finally say i tried it . 
3		we went here on friday for my birthday and thought the ordering process would be pretty simple , everyone in our group wanted to order an entree but then it got complicated . <sssss> we were told this was `` tapas style '' ordering and that instead of entrees they recommended 2-3 plates per person . <sssss> what ? <sssss> we each ended up ordering one thing and sharing it and that was more than enough for the whole table . <sssss> i ca n't imagine if we each got 2-3 things . <sssss> it took us probably 30-45 mins just to figure out how to order . <sssss> the food was pretty good , spicy but seemed to cool down quickly once left on the table . <sssss> they do n't bring you many tortillas either for your items . <sssss> my biggest gripe is that they were out of churros for dessert . <sssss> how can you be out of churros ? <sssss> we settled for the el fuerte which was n't as satisfying as a crispy cinnamon sugar churro . 
3		after all of the hype this places seems to have i must say that i did n't really see what all the rave was about . <sssss> pro 's : quick service unique atmosphere great chips & salsa con 's : dishes are to big , and quality is lacking . <sssss> servers are not a knowledgeable as they should be will we go back ? <sssss> maybe ... ... 
3		we absolutely loved the assorted breads that were brought out at the beginning and we also raved about the oysters we had for appetizer . <sssss> delicious ! <sssss> thanks yelpers for that appetizer tip ! <sssss> i had the petite filet and it was pretty bland . <sssss> i 've had much , much better . <sssss> my husband had the fish that was a special and highly recommended by the waiter . <sssss> the presentation was terrible and it just tasted ok . <sssss> we had mac & cheese and mushrooms for sides and they were good . <sssss> the restaurant has a nice atmosphere and a big bar area that was fun to wait at and have a drink before our table was ready . <sssss> the waiter/service was ok , but nothing like you would expect at a nice steak restaurant . <sssss> one other thing , i ca n't stand having someone in the restroom `` assisting you '' with the soap and towels and feeling obligated to tip . <sssss> i think it is cheesy and irrating . <sssss> i probably would not go back to this restaurant . 
3		we ate lunch . <sssss> the food was very good but the portions were a little small . <sssss> the wait staff was very attentive . <sssss> the atmosphere is very lovely especially on the patio . <sssss> this would be a good place for a special occasion . <sssss> the food is a little over priced for what you get . 
3		i was in town on business , and took a slightly different route back to the hotel and saw this market center . <sssss> the `` super l ranch market '' looks suspiciously like a ranch 99 and while i was checking out , i asked the cashier and she confirmed my suspicion . <sssss> they have pretty much all what you would expect from a chinese grocery store , fruit , snacks , meats , seafood , etc. . 
3		its subway . <sssss> thats about all their is to say about this place . <sssss> i will say it is a very clean well run store and the owner takes pride in this location . 
3		meh ... it 's a nice change from ihop when i 'm craving breakfast for dinner . <sssss> the portions were large , but nothing really stood out like i had hoped . <sssss> i 'll be back to try their huckleberry options though for sure . 
3		z'tejas is like old faithful . <sssss> i know what i 'm going get , and it 's usually pretty good . <sssss> the last time i was here i had the guacamole appetizer , hickory burger , and a patron margarita . <sssss> all of it was good -lrb- although not excellent -rrb- , but most disappointingly , i thought the margarita was over-priced for the quantity i got . <sssss> z'tejas is n't my favorite restaurant in town , but the service is consistent , and it 's a safe choice for dinner or happy hour with groups of friends with different tastes . 
3		i went to chez nous one evening with friends after dining across the street at the paisley violin . <sssss> it 's current location is relative new . <sssss> they were previously located at the corner of 7th ave and indian school , but were forced to move last year to make way for a fresh and easy . <sssss> although i never visited the original location , those that have say the new location is virtually identical in decor to the original . <sssss> the bar itself is quite small and intimate . <sssss> booths line one wall , bar tables populate the middle , and the bar itself runs nearly the length of the other wall . <sssss> live music is apparently a regular event at chez nous . <sssss> the night i went , a jazz/soul band was performing . <sssss> i like live music , but often times the performers are not that great , especially in a smaller venue . <sssss> this group was actually quite good , and their music made the evening all that more enjoyable . <sssss> although there is no formal dance floor , people danced in the available space . <sssss> the drinks are reasonably priced , and the bartenders friendly . <sssss> although i walked there , the parking lot appeared large enough to accommodate a good sized crowd . <sssss> support your community/neighborhood bars ! 
3		arguably , priority in a restaurant rating should be given to the food , and in this department , litchfield 's excels . <sssss> the locally sourced steaks were perfectly trimmed , cooked exactly to order and juicy and flavorful . <sssss> salad dressings were beautifully balanced and obviously carefully homemade , and the selection of cheeses on the cheese plate , were perfectly aged and carefully chosen . <sssss> ambience , service , and presentation were another story though . <sssss> first , on this saturday night , the place was unbearably noisy , despite not being full . <sssss> the music , besides being all wrong for the average age of the clientele , was way too loud . <sssss> the server showed a lack of experience , from setting an overflowing beer on the table without a napkin or coaster under it , to never asking if we wanted refills until dinner was over . <sssss> but worst was main course presentation . <sssss> beautifully cooked steaks were just piled on top of the two sides in a stack , in a sort of oblong deep white bowl . <sssss> when my steak first arrived . <sssss> i wondered where my risotto and my mushrooms were , but i soon discovered them completely hidden under the slab of meat piled in the dead center of the bowl . <sssss> the albeit delicious smoky meat juices ran down onto the side dishes and made everything taste the same . <sssss> the delicate , perfectly cooked risotto lost much of its charm soaked in meat juice and the mushrooms were overwhelmed by it . <sssss> i 'll give them another try , but i hope they raise their levels to be commensurate with their prices , or i 'll have to write them off my favorites list . 
3		when i think of sushi roku , i am indifferent . <sssss> you know ... that feeling ... the absence of any emotional reactions . <sssss> for me , the dining experience involves so many things . <sssss> and usually that precedent is set from the moment you walk up to the hostess stand . <sssss> why is this an undervalued position at most restaurants ? <sssss> please , sushi roku , do not put someone at the front desk that can not seat people properly . <sssss> after two strolls through the dining room while walking back to tables that were n't open ... not once , but twice ... i finally asked to just stand where i was until they could find me a seat . <sssss> maybe it was a bad night for them , who knows . <sssss> but , if you read my reviews you 'll see i 'm an overly friendly yelper . <sssss> the fact that i actually got irritated and let the hostess know i was frustrated speaks high volume . <sssss> moving along , the food was great and the server was great . <sssss> this was n't my first time here . <sssss> i 've eaten here several times , including breakfast a few times . <sssss> the dishes we had : organic garden salad - delicious ! <sssss> mixed vegetable tempura - broccoli was the best american kobe potsticker `` gyoza '' - loved baked lobster roll - must try ! <sssss> salmon sashimi - maybe was n't feeling the sushi , just ok and if you like pear , do n't skip the pear martini ! <sssss> garnished with parmesan cheese ! <sssss> amazing flavor and plus a little antipasti bonus . <sssss> i 've yet to have a full experience at sushi roku , but that does n't mean i 'll stop going . <sssss> it might be one of those ongoing hit and miss situations - i just keep hitting the miss . <sssss> looking forward to the hit ! 
3		i had lunch at pita jungle with my mom yesterday . <sssss> we were looking for something close , good and healthy and pita jungle met our criteria . <sssss> i live around the corner and eat there often . <sssss> i would not say this is the most authentic food on the planet , but the food is always fresh , affordable and ample ! <sssss> my mom and i could have -lrb- and should have -rrb- split a pita and left there completely satisfied . <sssss> she got the gyro and i had a chicken shwarma pita . <sssss> both were pretty good -lrb- although i prefer to go a mile down the road to eden 's grill for the real deal , which i did later that night -rrb- . <sssss> the atmosphere at pita jungle is great . <sssss> it 's very open and the decor is contemporary , music is decent . <sssss> the patrons seem to be healthy and happy , which adds positively to the ambiance . <sssss> the service can be hit-or-miss , but overall everyone is friendly , just at times can be a bit slow . <sssss> i recently went there for happy hour , which i liked and hated all at the same time . <sssss> i enjoyed being able to sample several small plates , expanding my experience with the menu , but the portions were minute , which was really surprising/disappointing since everything i 've ever had there is ridiculously over-sized . <sssss> while it was fun to taste some new things , it was a bad value and i likely wo n't return for another happy hour . <sssss> overall , it 's convenient , has a nice atmosphere and is fresh and healthy . <sssss> i think it 's well above average , but again , when i have a craving for real middle eastern fare , i would just assume running a bit further down the road for some more authentic food . 
3		one of the more iconic sports bars in phoenix is majerles . <sssss> named for and run by dan majerles of the phoenix suns , this bar sits just one block away from the arena and tends to host some of the rowdier crowds during the suns games . <sssss> majerles is consistently ranked one of the top sports bars in the country by sports illustrated . <sssss> this accolade is well deserved . <sssss> majerles is small but laid out well with the bar in the center with smaller high-tops encircling it with booths along the outer wall . <sssss> this system works well for the different types of crowds that come into majerles . <sssss> there is also outdoor seating and usually a scantily-clad hostess standing with them . <sssss> nothing special about the menu but everything is good . <sssss> the chicago burger , with its blue cheese , is a personal favorite . <sssss> the bar features the usual selection of domestics and imports as well as specialty liquor . <sssss> this is not really a kid-friendly environment but there is nothing to suggest they should n't attend . <sssss> because the bar is more intertwined with the restaurant and the waitresses are usually minimally dressed , cooper 's town might make a better impression on the younger ones . <sssss> the food is better there too . 
3		good prices , decent food . <sssss> it should be noted on the menu that there is meat in the pizza muffins , but it is not . <sssss> as a vegetarian , this would have been vital information to know . <sssss> my calzone was alright , nothing special , but i might return for a pizza . <sssss> will update when i return . 
3		nice place . <sssss> attached to the ipic theater and tanzy . <sssss> only gets 3 stars because it is empty !!! <sssss> i think people think of this as the `` movie theater '' bar and go to tanzy or the champagne bar next door ... too bad , it has great potential . <sssss> they even had bleu cheese olives for my martini . 
3		been to this location a few times , i just ca n't love it . <sssss> it is ok . <sssss> decent service , decent food , large menu selection , large drink selection , but nothing fablous about it . <sssss> =-lrb- mac & cheese = yum , the goldfish crunch on top is good french dip = good burger melt = good baked alfredo chicken potatoe = good half baked cookie with ice cream = good maybe it is because i have had the some items else where and those tasted fablous ! 
3		i love options . <sssss> i 'm the kind of person that when i have chicken strips , i want 4 different dipping sauces . <sssss> this place fulfills my need for options in a way that their competitors ca n't . <sssss> the menu is a little confusing , and the daily specials board does n't have prices or explain that it includes a drink . <sssss> i had the special , the chicken tostada salad , a tostada with rice and beans , piled with romaine , chicken , pico de gallo , a dollop of sour cream , tortilla strips , and some dressing that tasted exactly like the jalapeno ranch i covered everything with at chuy 's when i lived in texas . <sssss> i also ordered chips and queso , which came with a pretty good salsa and more pico . <sssss> drinks ! <sssss> vanilla coke ! <sssss> horchata ! <sssss> tea and lemonade ! <sssss> -lrb- see what i mean about options ? -rrb- <sssss> everything is served in foil `` to-go '' containers , with lids on the condiment bar for easy transport . <sssss> next time i go i think i 'll try one of the tortillas they seem so proud of . <sssss> oh , and visit their website and click `` i do n't care '' down toward the bottom . <sssss> you 'll thank me . 
3		i like pj , the hummus platter is always a winner . <sssss> for some reason though this location lacks some jazzzzz that the other location on scottsdale and shea seems to have . <sssss> how can that be explained ?!?! <sssss> same menu , same food but somehow not the same . <sssss> we do come here since the location is convenient but every time i sit down , i ca n't seem to help myself and compare this pj to the other pj . <sssss> i know , i 'm so unfair . <sssss> well , good thing sushi station is next door as that seems to be where i 've been gravitating towards lately ! 
3		wednesday 's nights fun with the 2-4-1 all night , but sometimes get crowded and too many overweight people push everybody around and also many people have in their luggage on the dance floor meaning that the purses i like pieces of luggage it 's ridiculous to bring dancing . 
3		i ca n't bring myself to give thai rama more than 3 stars ... i love thai food , and i wanted to love thai rama , but i just did n't . <sssss> i thought the restaurant itself was cute , casual , and unassuming ... the staff was friendly but not the most attentive . <sssss> i was there on a sunday night recently , and i felt extremely comfortable dining solo -lrb- big plus for that -rrb- . <sssss> unfortunately , when i was given my menu , there was a dried up noodle stuck to it , and the napkins on the tables are pretty but polyester and not the best for wiping the noodle off or absorbing anything at all for that matter . <sssss> i was also disappointed that i did n't see a thai salad with peanut dressing or summer rolls on the menu . <sssss> i decided to order the # 6 to start - lab gai -lrb- finely chopped chicken lightly sauteed in lemon juice with red onion and mint -rrb- . <sssss> maybe i should 've ordered it without onion because onion was everywhere ! <sssss> the flavor of the chicken was good , but it was difficult to eat with so much onion . <sssss> i went with the vegetarian dish # 69 -lrb- yes , i said 69 -rrb- as my entree . <sssss> paht paug jae or vegetable deluxe . <sssss> i requested that they add eggplant and they did - it was pretty tasty and i cleaned my plate with that one . <sssss> overall , the meal was ok . <sssss> maybe i 'm spoiled by some other thai favorites in the valley , but i 'm glad i experienced thai rama . <sssss> i probably will not rush back , but if you 're looking for a decent thai meal and you 're in the cen pho area , you can find it at thai rama . 
3		i parked and as i was walking in i read a hand scrawled sign on the door `` especiales '' . <sssss> one of these especiales was a chicharron burrito . <sssss> deep down i expected only half expected what i got when i decided to order this . <sssss> now i 'm from new mexico and a chicharron there is different from a mexican style chicharron , for the most part . <sssss> the mexican style is the pork rind/skin usually fried till crisp then often they are either eaten alone -lrb- or with a few dashes of hot sauce -rrb- or simmered in a red or green chile sauce until soft again . <sssss> in the new mexican version chicharones is the fat back , the fat and meat layer just below the skin which is cubed and rendered until crispy . <sssss> again i was hoping it would be more on the new mexican side . <sssss> the burrito was the size of my shoe . <sssss> this was a generous size filled with whole beans , toasty homemade spanish rice and eventually i found a few cueritos/chicharrones . <sssss> honestly for $ 2.99 i ca n't complain . <sssss> the salsa bar was ok , the salsa verde was quite good . <sssss> i also ordered a licuado de pina -lrb- a more liquid milky version of a pineapple shake -rrb- . <sssss> it was just as i hoped . <sssss> it 's a divey joint , ala filiberto 's . <sssss> would i go back , maybe ... 
3		nice conveyer belt with various sushi on it . <sssss> the plates determine what you pay as they are colored different thus different amounts . <sssss> i have not seen a sushi place like this before in the phoenix area , this remains me of la or sf . <sssss> the sushi was ok some better than others , you have to keep an eye out for plates that have been on the conveyer belt for a while since these may not be as fresh . <sssss> overall , this is an interesting find and the kids get a kick out the food on the belt . <sssss> just be careful how much plates you take off the conveyer belt these add up quickly . 
3		i 've visited this place twice and twice , i 've gone with the gyro platter . <sssss> pita bread - warm , super soft , a bit on the small side . <sssss> given the portion of meat they give , i do n't know how the few pieces of pita are enough . <sssss> the meat - a beef/lamb combo , is seasoned well , a bit salty and greasy - not unexpected . <sssss> the main concern with the gyros are a lack of produce on the side . <sssss> the platter does offer a greek salad -lrb- which had lettuce in it along with the cucumbers , tomatoes , red onions , and feta , which was a bit different , but i would have liked to have some undressed produce to go along with the gyros and yoghurt . <sssss> the platters are also served with a side of rice - soft and flavorful , but nothing too spectacular . <sssss> there is also a huge side of roasted lemon potatoes . <sssss> and this is n't some minor lemon flavor ... it 's strong . <sssss> i also ordered the falafel on the side . <sssss> crispy , and served with tzatziki . <sssss> they 're delicious , just a bit small . <sssss> however , they 're inexpensive enough to just order a few extras . <sssss> -lrb- order 4 falafel and save a penny ! -rrb- <sssss> staff is friendly . <sssss> there 's a drive through available and plenty of seating inside , although the decor is a bit old and furniture is run-down . <sssss> not worth an out of the way trip , but the volume of food is generous and the prices are reasonable . 
3		i am something none of the other review are n't . <sssss> an actual new yorker . <sssss> to me there are about 4 different kinds of pizza , the kind you can get la piazza el forno which is the top of the top , new york pizzeria pizza which is primarily what i ate in ny . <sssss> pizza that tries to be ny pizzeria pizza and the crap that does n't even bother , your pizza hut , pappa johns all that . <sssss> this is n't the best pizzeria pizza but it 's good enough . <sssss> the closest i can compare it to is ny pizza department which is in the same league but just different enough they put too much cheese on the pizza here but that 's something i know for next time , the pizza is scolding hot when it comes out of the oven the way it 's supposed to . <sssss> its nice that ray 's is around the corner and happens to be pretty damn good . 
3		this place was ok . <sssss> they have a good selection of dogs . <sssss> my wife really likes it , as well as a couple of family members . <sssss> i on the other hand am not too big of a fan of charred hotdogs . <sssss> either way , the food there is ok . <sssss> the lines are a bit too long for me . 
3		3 things about this place : 1 . <sssss> unfortunately , the food is not the best thing about this place , their service is the best side about this place . <sssss> 2 . <sssss> the good news is that the food is almost as good as the service . <sssss> big portions , food comes normal/fast -lrb- never late -rrb- . <sssss> 3 . <sssss> they could be at a better location and update the furniture . <sssss> if this place goes with a `` country/farmy '' look and style it will hit the jackpot ! 
3		okay kona , you redeemed yourself . <sssss> after my last experience i did n't think i would be coming back anytime soon , but my friend talked me into happy hour this evening . <sssss> our waiter tonight -lrb- in the outdoor bar area -rrb- was great , he was constintly checking on us to make sure our drinks were filled and to see if we needed more food . <sssss> since there were half price items on the happy hour menu of course we went with those items . <sssss> margherita flatbread : cooked perfectly ... the crust was crispy , the ratio 's of tomato & mozzarella were spot on and the balsamic reduction gave it just the right kick . <sssss> crab crunch roll : yum , yum and yum ... crab special roll with tempura flakes drizzled with eel sauce . <sssss> super delicious . <sssss> philadelphia roll : smoked salmon , cream cheese and cucumber is a lovely fresh tasting roll . <sssss> all in all this dining experience took me from never wanting to come back here to a-okay and will be back to try more options . 
3		is there anything worth waiting 5 hours for ? <sssss> that 's a pretty tall order to ask of anything , but somehow my friends and i were suckered into thinking pizzeria bianco might be . <sssss> the pizza is decent , but not the mind-blowing orgasmic experience i expected . <sssss> i tried a slice of the wiseguy -lrb- delicious fennel sausage , less then amazing onions -rrb- and a slice of the rosa -lrb- interesting concept putting pistachios on a pizza , but the red onions were a bit too sweet -rrb- - but i 'd take grimaldi 's in brooklyn over this any day and the wait there never even came close to 5 hours . <sssss> i left with an overwhelming feeling of , `` well , now i know '' ... but the sad thing is : i doubt this mediocre review is going to stop anyone else from just having to go see what all the hype is about . 
3		nice enough . <sssss> shocktop served with orange , check . <sssss> friendly servers , check . <sssss> steak prepared to the proper doneness , check . <sssss> sports on the tele , check . <sssss> if that 's all you look for in a chain steak restaurant , you might as well quit reading and just go . <sssss> still here ? <sssss> oh . <sssss> the cuts of meat are n't what i 'd call great . <sssss> fries should not , i repeat , should not , be affected by gravity when you hold one end . <sssss> also , what happened to the fine art of presentation ? <sssss> i noticed this at olive garden as well . <sssss> can we make a bit more effort than placing a steak perfectly in the middle of a round white plate and sending it out ? <sssss> how ` bout a little garnish or something ? <sssss> no pride these days , i tells ya . 
3		the fresh tortilla thing is pretty cool and the fact that they use all white meat chicken is a huge plus , but the chicken is not marinated as stated . <sssss> not a huge fan of the mix all the ingredients together in the burrito before you roll it thing either . <sssss> the girl was mixing for at least 2 minutes . <sssss> it does n't make a difference in my opinion . <sssss> the chips are blue and way better than the competition - you get a huge bag for 75 cents . <sssss> it seems an exact copy of rio also , but rio slices the chicken and this places dices it . <sssss> guac is extra and looked a bit tired at 9pm on sunday , but nobody can top chipotle guac , so i passed and the mild salsa 's are both pretty good . <sssss> it still is a good burrito place , if not spectacular , but will hit the spot if you just want the basics and not the bells and whistles . <sssss> about $ 7.50 total . 
3		being invited to dinner one does n't have the privilege of choosing the spot so blu burger grille seemed an ok spot to join out of town guests . <sssss> wrong ... before i arrived i checked the site out and was disappointed to read an awful review but i went with an open mind . <sssss> i arrived before my party and walked into the grille to check it out . <sssss> i had to take a step back from the scent of fried oil or so it seemed . <sssss> the grilles sq. footage is small with patio type tables and booths . <sssss> the host or cashier greeted me -lrb- chewing gum -rrb- and told me to take any seat i liked . <sssss> i opted for the outside patio while waiting for my party . <sssss> no one even ventured out offering me water nor did they take the time to clean the tables covered with grease . <sssss> finally 15 minutes into my wait a server came out and asked if i wanted a drink . <sssss> -lrb- maybe he did n't see me at first -rrb- . <sssss> with water and a menu before me i browsed to see my options . <sssss> the menu , original and entertaining , offered step 1-6 build your burger , clever `` lettuce '' build your burger selections , salads , sandwiches and sides . <sssss> well guess what , my dinner companions call and ask where i am . <sssss> yep they picked blu burger grille but at the summit and thank goodness for change of venues . <sssss> like night and day , so was the blu burger at the summit . <sssss> yes the menu was the same as were the booths and chairs but that was about all . <sssss> the summit was clean with a fabulous stocked bar and excellent service . <sssss> my burger topped with mushrooms , onions and gorgonzola cheese was perfect . <sssss> the sweet potatoe fries crispy and tasty . <sssss> if you are craving for a burger try blu burger grille but at the summit . 
3		while i am partial to good hole-in-wall mexican food , i was pleased to find a nice alternative to tacos and chimichangas . <sssss> we sat on the patio , which is a great patio btw , to enjoy the beautiful weather before it 's gone . <sssss> we ordered -lrb- yes , ordered -rrb- chips and salsa and guacamole . <sssss> they serve two salsas , both green . <sssss> the spicier one had the most flavor . <sssss> the chunky one was a little bland to me . <sssss> i had crab enchiladas in a chipotle sauce . <sssss> i asked the server if the chipotle was firey hot since i do n't care for that . <sssss> she stated the crema it 's mixed in cancels out the heat . <sssss> not so , it still had a nice kick . <sssss> if you really ca n't tolerate spicy food , i would n't order anything with chipotle , however . <sssss> i like that sauteed veggies are an option in addition to the standard beans and rice . <sssss> they were fresh and still crisp . <sssss> my husband had the lamb adobo . <sssss> he complained the amount of lamb -lrb- it was still on the bone -rrb- was insufficient given the bowl of adobo sauce and the price . <sssss> we are not exactly light eaters mind you . <sssss> while some other yelpers have noted service issues , we had a fantastic server . <sssss> . <sssss> pleasant , efficient , attentive without being intrusive . <sssss> my complaints . <sssss> offering chips and salsa , yet charging . <sssss> why is it that a $ 10/plate restaurant offers them complimentary , yet this restaurant charges when their meals are nearly $ 20 ? <sssss> to me , this is like expecting your customers to pay for their bread basket . <sssss> desserts were lacking . <sssss> my husband had the flan . <sssss> i 'm not a fan , so i did n't try it , but he was n't overly impressed . <sssss> i had the chocolate tamale . <sssss> for some reason , i expected it to be a sweet tamale . <sssss> instead , it was just chocolate cake in a husk . <sssss> not bad , but not heavenly either , evidenced by the fact i did n't finish it , a rarity in the dessert world for me . <sssss> other offerings were ice cream and chocolate cream pie . <sssss> i 'm sure we 'll return since it 's so close to us , but i 'll bring my own chips and a bottle of pace next time ! 
3		pretty ok . <sssss> visited several times . <sssss> been for lunch -lrb- roast beef really good -rrb- . <sssss> bar scene is nice , rustic-type atmosphere . <sssss> had office group & several plates of all the different appies to nosh on , was good . <sssss> martinis are ` ok ' , same goes for glasses of wine . <sssss> good for an after work sorta thing . 
3		this place is very good for a filipino dinning experience . <sssss> it 's a bit pricey but the service is good and the people are nice . <sssss> i would recommend it as they have many options on their menu . 
3		i can dig ... what can go wrong when you have a mechanical bull in your establishment ?? <sssss> think i need one in my office :-rrb- down to earth fun and every time i come , they 're rocking 80 's music . <sssss> man i 'm getting old . <sssss> how does one become a mechanical bull ride navigator ? <sssss> that guy has the best job ! <sssss> first off - dudes , yeah just stay off the bull it 's not cool . <sssss> gals , please step right up - this is where the fun begins . <sssss> you can imagine the decor of the place ... old western style . <sssss> drink specials is n't much to rave about but they do well . <sssss> as for dining here ... i 'm not sure . <sssss> i feel a tad bit dirty for some reason when i 'm done with this place - enjoy ! 
3		disappointed with the check-in process which , upon arrival , the line had only 3 people in front of me . <sssss> there were about 10 open computers and only 3 people working . <sssss> even with the three , 20 minutes went by , finally , it was my turn . <sssss> soon afterwards , a large group from another flight arrived and the line quickly grew to over 20 persons -lrb- poor bastards -rrb- this is the first time to use hertz and i found the check-in process to be slow and cumbersome . <sssss> alamo , who i usually use , is much quicker . <sssss> they were able to give me a free upgrade though which was very cool . <sssss> someone hit the rental and the process has not been too painful thus far -lrb- i 'll keep ya 'll posted on final resolution -rrb- 
3		this place has a huge selection of products ! <sssss> a lot of ready to go food , nice selection of drinks . <sssss> gas prices on the higher side , but a good store to stop off at . <sssss> guess i must not have been here during the evenings ?? <sssss> i have n't notice any issues with people hanging out ! <sssss> but i 'm not saying it does n't happen . <sssss> i 'll stop off here once in awhile on my way to work at 4 in the morning . <sssss> get what ever i need . 
3		good quality dogs . <sssss> i got two of the regular sized -- chicago and chili cheese . <sssss> both tasted great , but they are n't huge dogs . <sssss> $ 6 for the pair , which is about fair , i 'd say . <sssss> as others have noted , the buns are great . <sssss> really friendly service . <sssss> i 'll definitely go again if i 'm in the neighborhood , but it wo n't be a destination in and of itself . 
3		the best dimsum in chandler or phoenix for that matter . <sssss> i think its the only dimsum in phoenix !!!!! <sssss> am giving this place 3 stars in relative scale to other dimsum places in phoenix , not sure if there is any other ... compared to its counterparts in la and sf , errrr i would not say its as good as the average dimsum places in those cities ... 
3		i have mixed feelings about the marquee theater , the wide stage and large standing area make it easy to see the band . <sssss> the floor that slopes down to the stage makes it even easier , because you can get a clear view even from the back . <sssss> the sound is decent , and they get some awesome bands . <sssss> on the other hand , the service fees that others have mentioned really are outrageous . <sssss> it really is a rip-off when a 19 dollar show becomes a 30 dollar show with parking and service fees . <sssss> i always manage to steal a few posters off the walls though ... hey i 'm 17 and their ticket prices are making me broke , i deserve to have something to show for it . <sssss> or at least that 's how i rationalize it ... haha . 
3		poor service . <sssss> do n't care attitude . <sssss> food so so ... 
3		this is a small farmer 's market . <sssss> the variety is minimal . <sssss> the atmosphere is very friendly though . <sssss> it is fun for the kids , but if you want to actually shop , not too good . 
3		just got to tempe and this was the spot i chose for dinner . <sssss> i was tired so i called in for take-out . <sssss> i ordered the lamb vindaloo pasty , a cup of leek and potato soup , and the shirley temple pudding . <sssss> the person taking my order said the order would be ready in 20 minutes so 21 minutes later i was parking my car and heading in to pick up my food . <sssss> getting into the restaurant was a little confusing . <sssss> i chose the door that had the restaurant name on it , but once i entered , it appeared that i came through a back entrance behind the bar area . <sssss> i made my way around to what i 'd consider the front of the restaurant and was guided to the pick up area . <sssss> the guys were friendly and my food was ready however they had my food on a plate and not prepared for take out . <sssss> i had a seat while they got it together . <sssss> i 'd say my pasty was very rich , spicy and flavorful . <sssss> i 'm used to pepper so i 'm guessing it may be too spicy for some . <sssss> the pasty was full of meat and i did n't feel slighted in the least . <sssss> the soup was great , would order it again , however , they put it in a styrofoam drinking cup covered with foil , not very travel friendly . 
3		clean , friendly . <sssss> i 'm not a big fan of their food though , but i will go there on occasion . <sssss> i like how its a small menu . 
3		an ok place to workout . <sssss> some of the staff are pretty quick on their tongues and at times can be very ignorant . <sssss> the place is always clean and for the most part , there are machines to workout with . <sssss> but there is always that machine that 's out of service and others that do n't have the right screw or clamp -lrb- incomplete machines -rrb- ... 3 stars on my scale ... 
3		out in verrado , the options are limited , very very limited when it comes to dining -lrb- actually when it comes to just about anything -rrb- . <sssss> we dined at grazie while visiting a friend who moved to east la -lrb- aka verrado -rrb- . <sssss> the setting/ambiance and location all were very pretty , serene and sweet . <sssss> the service was pretty slow considering there were n't that many people in the restaurant but not terribly bad . <sssss> the food was just another boutique pizza experience . <sssss> we order the piata misto -lrb- assorted italian cured meats and cheeses -rrb- -- i 've had better , the quality was n't that great and the cheese came in all these itty bitty cubes . <sssss> then we ordered about 5 different pizzas , they were good , not great . <sssss> the dessert though made me want to do cartwheels , it was the dolce della casa and i want to eat one of these everyday for the rest of my life . <sssss> so , would i eat at grazie regularly ? <sssss> no . <sssss> would i eat it if i were out in verrado again ? <sssss> yes . 
3		sushi is one of the foods that you really get what you pay for usually ... especially living in a place where you 're no where near fishing areas . <sssss> but hey , i 'm a college student and i like to get my low fat sushi fix on a $ 10 budget sometimes . <sssss> i 'll rate it for what it is : fun and cheap with not the best sushi , but it 'll do . <sssss> if you 're not used to revolving sushi places -lrb- lots and lots in california -rrb- , 90 % of the time sushi left standing there rotating is not going to fresh and warm . <sssss> although fun , if you want sushi a little bit colder you 're going to order it from the chef . <sssss> you 're just going to the get the most basic variety of sushi here , and it 's mostly the lower grade fishes . <sssss> however , it 's recipe for fun for groups : cheap instant sushi and japanese beer readily available . <sssss> oh and guess what ? <sssss> j-pop and anime music playing in the background ! <sssss> as far as service , this place is consistently packed whenever i go , so expect service to be slow . <sssss> bottom line : cheap fun with friends , but you get what you pay for ... not that great of sushi , but it 's price is enticing for any poor student such as myself . 
3		i 'm not a big fan of italian food , but i was craving pasta and pesto and my daughter wanted mac n'cheese . <sssss> i 'd driven by babbo many times so figured we 'd try it . <sssss> home run ! <sssss> the bread they bring to the table was fabulous ! <sssss> nice start . <sssss> the staff was very nice and quick . <sssss> my daughter loved her mac n'cheese and i had a tasty steak and pesto dish . <sssss> the noodles were a little al dente - and i 'm a mushy pasta girl . <sssss> the steak was tasty , the pesto was quite good and i had adequate garlic breath when i left ! <sssss> i will go back to try something else there - their menu was quite large and had some interesting appetizers and dishes . <sssss> and their wine list looked nice too ! 
3		they are good but pricey and sometimes when you bite into what you 're thinking is a delicious taco you 'll find some kind of strange fatty meat or connective tissue . <sssss> this has happened twice on two separate occasions . <sssss> they need to do a better job of cleaning up the excess bits off the meat either before or after cooking to get a 4th star from me . 
3		nice patio , good food , and good service . <sssss> i 'm not over-the-top on this place , but it 's good to go there every once in awhile . <sssss> i think they cater to a slightly older demographic -lrb- say 30-60 -rrb- . <sssss> put it this way , my parents love this place , we just like it . <sssss> if the vibe was a little bit younger and hipper , i would have given it four stars . 
3		you must look for the signs to park in the park and they will direct you , might i mention that right across the street is short leash dogs ? <sssss> so take your pick . <sssss> the inside is surprisingly big , dim , and cool . <sssss> if you enter in the back to your right you will find the enormous condiment counter with every hot sauce , sauce you can think of . <sssss> the menu is really big and we took about several minutes to look everything over . <sssss> in addition to that , there are signs to modify everything if that does n't make the menu that more exciting . <sssss> platter of big chocolate chip cookies , brownies and lemonade were calling my name but if it were not for my diet , i would have given in . <sssss> i had the usual falafel plate with french fries and my other diner had the steak sandwich . <sssss> the fries were thick but tasted a little old , and some were brown like they were old . <sssss> the falafel was crisp , they are fried into little discs rather than balls and the pita bread , while soft , appeared not home made . <sssss> i felt like i was still hungry after this meal . <sssss> my companion 's sandwich he proclaimed was good but was a bit too small , and the potato salad it came with seemed to be made with lots and lots of mustard and very little mayonnaise . <sssss> the service was friendly and i will probably return to try something else as i saw they have breakfast specials but it has not become my most beloved of places . 
3		i live 5 minutes from the valle luna mex . <sssss> restaurant . <sssss> i have eaten their numerous times because of locality and party invitations . <sssss> i have never been crazy about their food . <sssss> it is '' valley of the sun sonoran style mexican food '' but it just does n't hit the spot with me . <sssss> they have a big following , crowded all the time . <sssss> alot of the reason is they run specials tuesday -lrb- reduced price for seniors -rrb- and wed. -lrb- family nite -rrb- . <sssss> i think some of the reason i do n't care for the place is i have been treated poorly 3 times in the past . <sssss> have you ever noticed that a place that has alot of business tend not to go out of their way to make you feel special ? <sssss> well if i 'm going to spend alot of money and make them money i expect more than the food , i expect service and made to feel that i 'm important and they are willing to go out of their way to make me happy . <sssss> unfortunately i do n't get that feeling from the waitresses or the management . <sssss> but , there is always a but , if you like fajitas , i think they have the best around and on wed. you can get the single for 10 bucks . <sssss> they have really jacked up the price the last few years . <sssss> 1 order is usually enough for 2. , but if your really hungry , do n't order the double , order 2 singles , i think its a better deal . <sssss> so now instead of turning left to valle , i turn right and go to manuels on cave creek , better food , better service . <sssss> oh and sit in the bar eddie the bartender is a crack up . <sssss> bob : and there you have the truth . <sssss> ciau . 
3		ate there years ago and the food was pretty good . <sssss> this time it was nothing special . <sssss> i guess ill have to keep looking for a really consistently good mexican place . 
3		my boyfriend and i came here for dinner after being told there would be over an hour wait for culinary dropout -lrb- sad face -rrb- . <sssss> we 'd always been curious about this restaurant-apparently it had won some sort of `` best of 2012 '' award-although i was a bit apprehensive that it only has 3 stars on yelp . <sssss> everything 's subjective i suppose . <sssss> we had to wait a bit here as well , although not nearly as long . <sssss> i was super excited to see salsa dancers and a band performing in the outdoor dining area . <sssss> we ended up being sat at the table right next to where the band was playing . <sssss> i was a bit worried about that ... i imagined having to shout my conversation or order to our server ... thankfully the band was n't obnoxiously loud . <sssss> our server was super friendly and helpful . <sssss> i ordered the red sangria and my boyfriend ordered the margarita . <sssss> the sangria was very delicious , however the margarita was so-so . <sssss> not the best i 've ever had , although i do n't normally drink margaritas . <sssss> we both ordered the tacos . <sssss> i do n't know what i ever expect to receive when i go to a nicer restaurant and order tacos . <sssss> i looked at the menu and thought `` wow , that 's some really inexpensive tacos ! <sssss> what a deal ! <sssss> 3 should be good for a meal ! '' <sssss> i also thought the same thing when i went to distrito -lrb- except they were pricier there -rrb- . <sssss> well . <sssss> . <sssss> the tacos we ordered were the tiny street tacos . <sssss> boo . <sssss> and 3 was hardly enough for a meal ! <sssss> ha . <sssss> that 's not a knock on them , it 's my own ignorance for not ordering 6 as a meal , like the menu suggested . <sssss> there just was n't many fish or vegetarian items to choose from on the menu , which was surprising to me-i just did n't want to settle for a quesadilla ! <sssss> i ended up getting 3 different kinds of tacos : salmon y mango , pescado , and the nopalitos -lrb- just because i was curious to figure out what the heck cactus tastes like -rrb- . <sssss> i ca n't quite recall what my boyfriend ordered . <sssss> . <sssss> at least one was carnitas . <sssss> our tacos came relatively quickly ! <sssss> i was really surprised considering how busy it was . <sssss> they were really tasty . <sssss> i enjoyed the pescado one the most , however the cactus taco was quite an interesting experience . <sssss> not bad , just not my cup of tea . <sssss> we also received salsa for our tacos , but both the green and red salsas were much too thin for my taste . <sssss> afterwards , we were still hungry so we ordered chips and salsa . <sssss> the salsa that came with the chips was miles better ! <sssss> overall , it was a pleasant dining experience . <sssss> the atmosphere with the decor and live music was very enjoyable and our server was extremely friendly . <sssss> the food was decent . <sssss> i would probably go back another time just because the service was quite good . 
3		small hole in the wall quick food for the drunken hordes that creep around mill at night . <sssss> or a quick bite during the day . <sssss> i like the falafels here better than at pita pit . <sssss> service was hospitable . <sssss> i 'll return . 
3		just ok ... the atmosphere was extremely dated , but the happy hour prices were good enough to give this place 3 stars ! 
3		if you like coronas and asu chicas then this is a very handy place . <sssss> the day time is fun , the night time gets a little packed . <sssss> food is ok not great . <sssss> your not really coming here though for the food ... 
3		good breakfast spot with friendly service . <sssss> definitely has a diner vibe . 
3		we like benihana but ca n't reach anybody to make a reservation . <sssss> been calling since 1215pm today . <sssss> then when u show up it 's a 40 min wait if if u can get in . <sssss> maybe they are having issues w phone service ? <sssss> michael 7035958885 . <sssss> ahwatukee . 
3		it 's been a few years but we had a really funny experience here . <sssss> you know how you watch all those disaster movies and you think to yourself `` those people are sooo dumb ... i would be smart in a crisis . '' <sssss> well , i was laying at the pool on the 3rd floor and enjoying my vodka and grapefruit juice -lrb- my 2nd one -rrb- when firefighters in full gear went running by . <sssss> what ??? <sssss> i looked around and while everyone noticed -lrb- it would be hard not to -rrb- they just layed back down . <sssss> i mean - fire - i guess we could get in the pool . <sssss> no one wanted to be the first to react . <sssss> well , i got to thinking about having to evacuate the hotel and there could be news filming , and i did n't want to go on the news in my swimsuit . <sssss> would you ? <sssss> i very casually got up and went to the elevators , which btw were running . <sssss> should n't they have been cut off ? <sssss> i went up to the 16th floor - stupid right ? <sssss> - looked out the window and saw all the fire trucks . <sssss> i got dressed , put on my makeup , and went back down to the lobby . <sssss> by this time the fire was put out and the trucks were gone . <sssss> no film at 11:00 . <sssss> would n't have mattered if they fire had been serious - i would have been a crispy critter . <sssss> all these years later i 'm beating myself up about this . <sssss> next time i 'll have my coverup available ! 
3		my fiance and family went to los taquitos the weekend after thanksgiving this year . <sssss> this place is literally down the street from me and for some reason or another , i have never stopped on by . <sssss> meal : our group had the chimichanga , ranchero eggs , enchiladas with eggs , and the chiliquetes . <sssss> we also added had the chips with salsa . <sssss> taste : the seasoning was nearly perfect unlike other mexican places nearby -lrb- like the original burrito company -rrb- , the food was both spicy and tasty . <sssss> it seems like too often that places confuse `` spicy hot '' as being tasty and well seasoned , but these places do n't have the expertise in making something incredibly hot and delicious ... but los taquitos does have that expertise . <sssss> their salsa , in my humble opinion , is the best i have had to date and its by no means typical . <sssss> it appears they take real pride in making their salsa special . <sssss> the only dig is that the chips were overcooked . <sssss> 8 out of 10 . <sssss> value : portions were more than fair and reasonable . <sssss> in fact , i would describe it that if you ate til you were full , you have a some left over for a small snack left over . <sssss> 4 out of 5 . <sssss> service/cleanliness : there is no waiter service , just a walk up counter . <sssss> the staff was mediocre . <sssss> they were n't rude or inept , but they sure were n't friendly . <sssss> it was sort of like a robot was taking our order . <sssss> 7 out of 10 . <sssss> atmosphere : the atmosphere is spot on of what you expect from a nice walk up taco and burrito place . <sssss> nothing fancy , easy going , and great music . <sssss> the scenery is going to `` wow '' you but should n't district you from the entire experience . <sssss> 3 out of 5 . <sssss> overall : i have been to a handful of walk up taco and burrito places in the valley and los taquitos takes top prize . <sssss> this is the perfect place if you want some authentic , simple , and fast mexican food for lunch or after a night of drinking ! <sssss> its one of those places where you sneak away to treat yourself with an awesome plate of mexican food . <sssss> 22 out of 30 points , 3 out of 5 stars . 
3		this place is old school to the point that the school needs to be rebuilt ... i think the crowd here on certain nights might be great , but the place itself is just too rundown . <sssss> we visited on a sunday night and were disappointed after all the positive reviews i 've read . <sssss> this bikini is dirty , old , and stinky . 
3		pretty good . <sssss> probably wo n't return though . 
3		decent food , great happy hour half off appetizers . 
3		conveniently located across the parking lot from harkins shea cinema . <sssss> they offer a step up from movie theater pizza for a quick bite before or after a movie . <sssss> the menu offers nice vegetarian selections . <sssss> the food is consistently okay . <sssss> beyond the hummus sampler it is mediocre vegetarian fare with a mediterranean influence . <sssss> the gelato spot is strategically located next door . 
3		the food is decent for the price , and we eat here fairly often . <sssss> the chips are good , as is the salsa . <sssss> my family eats everything from burritos , tacos , to mini chimichangas , and all are flavorful . <sssss> my only real complaint is that the service is n't great . <sssss> the people who work the counter are monotone and border on rude half the time . <sssss> they are also stingy with chips when you order to go . <sssss> they give you a decent amount when you eat in , but with a to go order , they balk at giving you enough for the order . <sssss> other than that - no real complaints and will continue to frequent for the food . 
3		go for happy hour and try out a tasty beverage . <sssss> i 'm a vegetarian so i never get a burger . <sssss> but its still most definitely worth a trip when you 're craving a cold treat ! 
3		staff here is friendly and fairly knowledgeable . <sssss> i bought 5 trees for my backyard back in november . <sssss> one of them died within a couple of months . <sssss> when i returned to a & p to ask about a warranty replacement , they told me that there was no warranty unless i purchased their soil and used it when i planted the trees . <sssss> this sort of annoyed me since i was never offered and informed about this when i bought the trees . <sssss> when i mentioned to them that i was never told about this option , the guy shrugged and basically told me i was s.o.l. partially my fault for not asking , but just as much their fault for not offering the soil/warranty to me at time of purchase . <sssss> so , a & p lost my business for the rest of my backyard landscaping ; i found another nursery with better selection and prices . 
3		i had the shrimp & chicken souvlaki kabob w / pita bread and veggies . <sssss> it was a bit overcooked yet still flavorful . <sssss> patio dining with a beautiful scenery made it extra special . 
3		i 've been a big fan -lrb- a five star fan of sakana -rrb- for at least 5 years . <sssss> when we moved to the south in 2006 and tried a handful of sushi places in mid-sized southern towns i really missed sakana . <sssss> we went last night to celebrate the new year and i was disappointed . <sssss> i think they may have changed management i know they change distributors . <sssss> the just was n't the same . <sssss> maybe they 're cutting corners because of the economy . <sssss> who knows ? <sssss> at any rate i 'll probably just drive up the scottsdale location next time - hopefully ray is still running that show to perfection . 
3		beware : this place is expensive . <sssss> i went in with my fiancee , did n't get anything as i was happy with a little sample cup , but he did n't even fill his cup up , and only added sprinkles and it came up to $ 5.15 ! <sssss> that could buy us two pints at the grocery store ! <sssss> it was good , but the price will be keeping me away . 
3		my first visit to swina was an accident - i had an appt . <sssss> for a massage at swiha and mistakenly turned into the parking lot next door . <sssss> the second time was when reparations at swiha caused them to close shop and move all appointments -lrb- including my massage -rrb- here . <sssss> i was not able to enjoy the massage as much , bec . <sssss> the open ceilings allowed all sorts of noises -lrb- conversations , construction noises coming from next door , etc. -rrb- in - too distracting . <sssss> i was able to experience my first mud wrap after first reading about swina 's offering back in june '08 last friday . <sssss> i 'd have to say it was nothing i thought it would be . <sssss> i thought i 'd be lying in a bed of mud -lrb- like i 've seen in european travel logs -rrb- w / some slices of fruit or veggies covering my eyes -lrb- no , not cucumber slices ... i 'm allergic to cukes ! -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> nope . <sssss> no mud bed . <sssss> no sliced garnishes placed on the windows of my soul . <sssss> however , i did get two women to simultaneously massage my back -lrb- cassie -rrb- and leg muscles -lrb- patty -rrb- !! <sssss> woah ! <sssss> so this is what tandem massages are all about !! <sssss> i asked if this was standard practice here in swina , 'cause if it is , i could definitely get used to this ! <sssss> but no , i 'm told that i got lucky that day , w / students ' schedules opening up at just the right moment to allow me this extra luxury . <sssss> -lrb- if you ask me , i think it 's a ploy to get newbies to come back for treatments week after week ! -rrb- <sssss> but let 's backtrack a bit and start in the beginning . <sssss> after stripping down to my comfort level -lrb- topless -rrb- , and lying face down on the massage table -lrb- i requested a face pillow for more comfort -rrb- , cassie and patty proceeded to give me the back and leg massages . <sssss> afterwards , they employed natural brushes over exposed areas for an all-over exfoliation . <sssss> the sensations ranged from slightly ticklish to soothing -lrb- you may tailor the pressure exerted -rrb- . <sssss> i was asked to flip over onto my back , and soon after , the mud was then painted on by both women with another set of brushes . <sssss> this was when the treatment started to go downhill for me ... the mud was applied cold , and thank goodness there was a heat lamp nearby to keep me warm . <sssss> after painting my back , arms , legs , and abs , the two women proceeded to wrap plastic around my extremities and then again w / another wrap that was already laid on top of the massage table under me . <sssss> -lrb- if you suffer from claustrophobia , body wraps are not for you ! -rrb- <sssss> patty then left cassie to help another student . <sssss> cassie then proceeded to give me my second favorite part of the treatment , which is a head and neck massage . <sssss> nice !! <sssss> after , cassie offered to give me something complimentary - a facial massage ! <sssss> would i want one ? <sssss> why , yes , thank you very much ! <sssss> after all that pampering , we were now at the point where i again had to endure chills while cassie wiped off the mud w / warm towels . <sssss> but i requested hotter towels , as in steaming hot ! <sssss> , and poor cassie ... her hands were burning ! <sssss> , but she did what i requested , and i was able to stave off the chills for awhile . <sssss> to `` wrap '' things up , cassie followed up w / a hypoallergenic lotus touch lotion . <sssss> my skin felt supple , but nothing different than what i 'd experience after a bath at home using aveda soothing therapy salts . <sssss> on the whole , the experience was good , but most of it is bec . <sssss> of cassie 's bedside manner . <sssss> i would n't hesitate to ask for her again . <sssss> however , i do n't think i 'd try another wrap - swina offers three : mud , seaweed , and herbal - since i 'd rather not get chilled , plus the plastic wraps used are n't biodegradeable , so i 'd feel guilty causing all that pollution ! <sssss> i 'd say that the tandem , head , neck , and facial massages were my favorite parts , and for that , i 'll just stick w / swiha . <sssss> i will be back to try other services -lrb- hour-long facials for $ 30 , anyone ? -rrb- <sssss> . 
3		i do n't know if this qualifies as an update . <sssss> however 101 bistro is now closed . <sssss> eighty sixed . <sssss> nada here anymora . <sssss> adios . <sssss> hasta la pasta . <sssss> rip 101 b ! 
3		the atmosphere of this place is very cool ; i really liked the layout and the decorations . <sssss> friendly staff as well . <sssss> had a good variety of drinks and food and their specialty house drinks were what we tried and they were good . <sssss> had the provolone fondue with pretzel bites , which were absolutely delicious . <sssss> perfect combo . <sssss> the entrees are a lot of common foods , the only reason i did not give four stars since a lot of it were things you could get at a lot of places , they just had their own twist on it . <sssss> we had the ribs , and the honey fried chicken . <sssss> both were good , but again both common plates you can get a lot of places . <sssss> had dessert which was really good , recommend checking that out . <sssss> not a very expensive meal , good place to stop in and enjoy some drinks and apps . 
3		the first time i visited culinary dropout was the second weekend after their opening . <sssss> it was very busy but our group was able to snag a table outside . <sssss> we received prompt and friendly service despite how crowded it was and were impressed by how smoothly everything was executed . <sssss> fun and upbeat . <sssss> go expecting to see a crowd of folks in their mid forties with a chance of children -lrb- in the bar area -rrb- . <sssss> very few people in the thirties age group . <sssss> the space is absolutely enormous but still somehow manages to stay packed all the time.the general consensus is that there are a few tasty dishes here , but all in all , the food leaves something to be desired . <sssss> the pretzel bites are yummy after a drink or two , though . <sssss> ;--rrb- * a warning for anyone who is the least bit musically inclined : stay far , far away from this establishment on the evenings when they showcase their live music . <sssss> it 's bad . <sssss> really . <sssss> bad . 
3		it 's nice to have a movie theater less than 2 miles from my apartment , but unfortunately it 's at tempe marketplace , which means finding parking almost ruins the movie going experience ! <sssss> however , if you can get past that , it 's actually a pretty good movie theater for the most part . <sssss> matinees are $ 7 for adults and they have the automated touch machines so you can bypass the line and get your tickets pretty quickly . <sssss> i did have a slight problem with one of the touch machines this past weekend because a few times it took me almost pounding on the machine for my selection to be activated . <sssss> even with that slight problem , i still got my ticket faster than if i had waited in line . <sssss> when you walk inside , the lobby is very spacious and the thing i have noticed everytime i have gone to a movie at this theatre is how clean it is . <sssss> they offer your typical movie concessions , as well as sliders , french fries and pizza . <sssss> regular sized sodas are $ 4.00 , but for 25 cents extra you can get a `` loyalty cup '' which buys you $ 1 refills when you bring it in on future visits to harkins theaters . <sssss> the reason i ca n't give this theater more than 3 stars is due to the seats . <sssss> goodness gracious they are uncomfortable ! <sssss> there is almost no give in them and within the two hours my movie played , i must have tried to adjust my position ten times and still never got completely comfortable . <sssss> also , and this is a minor pet peeve , but the arm rests do n't lift up . <sssss> i really like that feature in other theaters . <sssss> all and all , a much better theater than the harkins at arizona mills , but not worth a special trip unless you live close to tempe marketplace and do n't mind spending time hunting for parking or parking super far away . 
3		generic soup , salad , sandwich place with lots of options . <sssss> i picked a soup and half sandwich combo , with the turkey avocado panini and chicken tortilla soup . <sssss> the sandwich looked so unappealing and did n't taste much better than that . <sssss> the soup was decent . <sssss> i liked the chocolate covered strawberry ... was n't expecting that . <sssss> i think this is a good addition to the plaza , but i would rather go to the biltmore for paradise bakery . 
3		pretty decent venue . <sssss> i went and saw a show here and was on the guest list so i ca n't really tell you about prices but from what i hear the are relatively low - $ 10 - $ 20 . <sssss> so not bad . <sssss> they do search you before you go in also ... so leave your damn guns at home okay . <sssss> . <sssss> mmkaay thanks . <sssss> pretty big inside . <sssss> nice stage area . <sssss> small but you can make due patio outside . <sssss> good beer bottle section-they had guinness so they won me over in that dept. one thing that sucks is you ca n't bring alcohol over by the stage . <sssss> so you either got ta watch from `` behind the line '' or leave your beer and hope you can come back to it and its not taken or have a rufi in it . <sssss> im big on bathrooms - and this one was not the cleanest so ladies squat do n't sit . 
3		everything about this place is fantastic : the bar , the atmosphere , the location ; except for one thing : the quality of the film projector . <sssss> it 's a dvd player hooked up via hdmi cable to a lousy digital projector . <sssss> i felt ripped off paying anything to watch a movie where i could see the pixels . <sssss> even the bargain theaters use actual film or a hq dlp . <sssss> the projector they use seemed akin to the ones used in high-school for power points . <sssss> this is not expensive to do , not professional , and not worth shelling out even 50 cents for . <sssss> i had high hopes going into this place because it really is a cool concept , and something badly needed in downtown phoenix . <sssss> but i felt like i was played . <sssss> i want to go here and see their indy films , but i ca n't help feeling cheater by their low-quality methods and general low standards . <sssss> anyone who is really into film would know that this is bullshit . <sssss> it 's a tell that the people who run this place are more excited about image than actual quality and substance . <sssss> typical hipster shenanigans . <sssss> also , honestly , they could do better with their film selection . <sssss> they get stuff super late , and it 's often not even to good stuff . <sssss> nice try , poor execution . <sssss> step it up , you 're not fooling people who are there to see films sober . 
3		this was a nice surprise . <sssss> was not expecting much but the staff was friendly and the food was good . <sssss> very much a mexican style southwest cafe . <sssss> not a huge amount to eat for kids or vegetarians but overall a good option when nearby . 
3		hmm . <sssss> i admit , i have little to no business reviewing a wine and cheese place . <sssss> i enjoy my wine as much as the next boozehound , but these high end places that cater to such a thing are usually lost on me . <sssss> cheuvront is no exception . <sssss> we sat on the patio with the surprisingly noisy light rail banging by all night -lrb- forgive me light rail , i still love you -rrb- . <sssss> my chair was broken , but the server kept his cool with us even though we must have sounded bitchy . <sssss> the bathroom situation was ... awkward , but again , maybe that 's just me . <sssss> i 'm sure that those with my proclivities are smart enough to avoid cheuvront by the name alone . <sssss> i ended up there and do n't want to throw the place under the light rail because its somewhere i 'd never normally go . <sssss> take it from someone a little higher on the social ladder than me maybe . 
3		i am split 50/50 on chuck e cheese 's here is my breakdown : pizza : i am pretty sure they have the worst tasting pizza that you will ever have ... ever ! <sssss> that being said little kids seem to love it . <sssss> the only reason we ever go to chuck e cheese 's is for the kids so if they love it , i can force it down . <sssss> games : their games is what makes it , every game is 1 token that is a huge win ! <sssss> you are defiantly getting the most bang for your buck when it comes to the arcade games . <sssss> safety : they stamp your parties hand when you come in and make sure you have the same stamp when you exit . <sssss> that way one of you kids do not go running off with another party . <sssss> we always feel safe having them running around . <sssss> over all : kids love it that is way we come back ! 
3		my wife and i have been wanting to try donovan 's for a very long time . <sssss> it 's taken us 2 yrs to finally give it a try . <sssss> after browsing the menu , we decided to order : prime peppercorn filet 10 oz , $ 53 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/donovans-steak-and-chop-house-phoenix?select=did6ocytpepzwejhjlbz6a#did6ocytpepzwejhjlbz6a north atlantic salmon , $ 32 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/donovans-steak-and-chop-house-phoenix?select=eq4wjwtn5jynpl_bfoq_bq#eq4wjwtn5jynpl_bfoq_bq skillet fried potatoes w/saut éed onions & peppercorn gravy -lrb- comes with the entree -rrb- http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/donovans-steak-and-chop-house-phoenix?select=aylgbe8xrtjz_in9qd8bgq#aylgbe8xrtjz_in9qd8bgq the joint is upscale and the ambience is pleasurable . <sssss> definitely not a place where you want to take small kids who are loud . <sssss> we were very impressed by the traditional , dark wood decor and bronze western themed statues . <sssss> it took a while to get our food ... much longer than expected . <sssss> but it 's a fine steakhouse , these types of things takes a while . <sssss> we enjoyed each other 's company while we waited , no big deal . <sssss> we knew there was a problem though when a supervisor or manager came up to apologize for the length of the wait ... that made us pay attention . <sssss> we also noticed that we had n't seen our server for a while . <sssss> we then noticed that a different server was coming to our table to pour wine from our bottle ... i jokingly said `` hey you must be our new server '' ... he had a slight grin and then went away . <sssss> our food finally arrived and i could n't wait to dig in . <sssss> i had the peppercorn filet and after the first bite knew it was n't for me . <sssss> there was way too much peppercorn on it for me . <sssss> normally , i like it but this was a bit much ... my bad for ordering it instead of a regular filet . <sssss> see the pic i posted and you 'll see how much pepper was on there . <sssss> i was hungry and it was my fault for ordering it , so i ate it . <sssss> the fried potatoes i ordered for the side dish was ok . <sssss> the wife enjoyed her salmon a lot . <sssss> after we ate dinner , the bus person cleared our table and we sat for a while ... where the heck was our server ? <sssss> i think he might 've went awol ... who knows , but after a while the other server who came by earlier stopped by to check on us . <sssss> normally , if a server goes home sick or takes a long break another server will let you know that they 'll be taking care of you ... but that never happened here . <sssss> since it was my wife 's birthday , she received a complimentary creme brulee ... nice touch and she enjoyed it , saved the place from getting rated 2 stars . <sssss> next time i will try something different . <sssss> return factor - 80 % 
3		what a waste of a nice dress ! <sssss> i came here for a friends birthday party and ca n't say that i would return unless i had too . <sssss> one of they guys in our group was wearing a t-shirt , a cute trendy one , but was not allowed in because guys need to wear collared shirts . <sssss> um ok ... but i saw one girl allowed in that i would n't let into mc donald 's allowed in with what she was wearing . <sssss> her shoes almost looked like house shoes and i ca n't imagine she had showered lately . <sssss> my friends and i just looked at each other kind of worried about what we would walk into . <sssss> once inside , it actually looks like a nice place , kind of small , but nice enough . <sssss> the music was alright , but you will see plenty of people past their prime attempting to dance . <sssss> the drinks left something to be desired . <sssss> i left early ... netflix was sounding really great at that time . 
3		i love the spicy chicken sandwich , also the iced tea/lemonade mixture i usually get instead of soda . <sssss> the waffle fries are usually awesome when they are fresh out of the fryer ... unfortunately the batch i got yesterday were cold and tasted like an ashtray . <sssss> the dog enjoyed them , though . 
3		a ok . <sssss> i have been here atleast a dozen times . <sssss> beer is always great . <sssss> food is pretty good , although the salmon blt was super dry last visit . <sssss> going there with a large party , 9 , with out of town family proved to be very bad . <sssss> told us 20 minutes to wait and ended up being over an hour . <sssss> some of the party went home because it took so long which was embarassing to me as i wanted them to have a good dinner . <sssss> next time i will come with a small party . <sssss> if there is a next time . <sssss> bummer . 
3		pretty good yogurt . <sssss> its downtown so its a little big pricey but overall i would say its a good place to get dessert or a treat during your busy day . <sssss> they update a new flavor pretty regularly . <sssss> today i had the carrot cake . <sssss> what i like about them is they put the toppings in the middle and on top . <sssss> so you do n't get gipped ! <sssss> like some other places . <sssss> they also have smoothes and yogurt to go . <sssss> the place is very clean , the people are nice and dessert is good . <sssss> stop in for a treat ! 
3		i checked out this place for the international supper club uye . <sssss> i love checking out food from around the world , in the us and in it 's native land . <sssss> so , this was cool . <sssss> i 've never been to bosnia . <sssss> i wondered what the food could be like because bosnia is a literally cultural melting pot with mediterranean , european and middle eastern influences . <sssss> i was eager to give it a try and see if any of those 3 cultures dominated the influence on the food . <sssss> you might drive past the tiny shopping plaza in which this restaurant is located . <sssss> why you ask ? <sssss> because it is about as nondescript as a traffic light , except you pay attention to the traffic light . <sssss> it 's also a rather run down plaza and is not attractive . <sssss> no worries , pull in to that parking lot and yeah , you 'll look around like , `` where is ursula sending me ... ????? '' <sssss> seriously , go inside . <sssss> you 'll quickly realize that you 've escaped the ho ' hum and entered eastern europe . <sssss> the inside of that restaurant is so neatly decorated , you feel like you 're in eastern europe . <sssss> fortunately , i was with a great group of yelpers . <sssss> i teamed up with preston s to split our entrees . <sssss> he ordered the pljeskavica and i ordered the cevapi . <sssss> both of these items are served on the tastiest , flakiest , buttery pastry type bread i 've had in quite some time . <sssss> the pljeskavica was a 4-star item with a the beef patty , mushrooms and cheese on that flaky pastry-like bun . <sssss> i would order this item again ! <sssss> the cevapi was somewhat like a kabob , but really reminded me of jimmy dean breakfast sausages in appearance . <sssss> but not in taste . <sssss> these small sausages are made of beef and lamb and are seasoned with bosnian spices . <sssss> this was a 3-star item for me . <sssss> if i ever get back over there , i must try the burek . <sssss> i have a feeling that i will enjoy that immensely ! <sssss> unfortunately , any place that serves dinner , but not wine generally gets a one-star-off from me . <sssss> this could have been a 4-star review from me ! <sssss> i wonder if you can do a byob . <sssss> i have to keep in mind that no booze could be a religious choice as well . <sssss> so i 'm giving them a 3.5 instead of taking the whole 1 star . <sssss> i always bump 3.5 star reviews to 4 stars . 
3		most of the food consumed at a ` bertos is like bad sex . <sssss> it 's cheap , dirty , and leaves you with a burning sensation the next day . <sssss> but fear not , gentle readers , i come bearing a message of hope . <sssss> not all ` bertos are created equal . <sssss> i used to live down the street from poliberto 's when it was happy china buffet , but never ventured into the dingy beige joint . <sssss> then they went and added some electric yellow paint and garish red trim and for some reason it drew me in like a skeeter to a bug zapper . <sssss> there was n't a drive-up here , only take out or dine-in , and the place was packed with my people . <sssss> us poor unfortunates that work outside all day , covered in sweat , dirt , and godknowswhat . <sssss> so i figured it was a sign of some sort . <sssss> and i was right . <sssss> the carnitas were tender and crispy , the guacamole was flavorful and chunky and there were about five different types of salsa for me to measure the mettle of my taste buds against . <sssss> it 's cheap as sin but does n't leave me with that seedy , slightly used feeling the next morning . <sssss> give it a whirl if you feel like your lard quotient for the week needs to be met . <sssss> it 's a step up from fili-b 's fare . 
3		the service was great , but the food is way average . <sssss> if you 're looking for good mexican food this is not the place . <sssss> this is a large chain that bastardizes mexican food . 
3		so if your looking for a nice quiet spot to have a drink or two or three on the outskirts of downtown , this is an okay place . <sssss> on 1st friday 's there is an eclectic crowd . <sssss> the only thing i have ordered from the food menu is wings . <sssss> they were great , but just a little to hot for me . 
3		fairly small place with limited parking in south scottsdale . <sssss> even though it is south scottsdale you pay old town or north scottsdale prices . <sssss> the chips and salsas that you get are substandard by comparison to places a lot cheaper . <sssss> the food does taste excellent , however my wife 's chicken came out very raw . <sssss> they gladly took it back and gave us a free dessert for the problem . <sssss> if they had lower prices i would rate it higher but the prices dont justify a higher star rating . 
3		phx airport is all about the airline you are flying on . <sssss> if you are on us airways , expect modern , clean , bright and tons of amenities . <sssss> it is their main hub and headquarters after all . <sssss> if only the same could be said for their airplanes ! <sssss> flying any other airline , anticipate a terminal that forgot to expect passenger traffic . <sssss> old , dingy and very sparse in terms of amenities . <sssss> pretty soon , the smithsonian will be calling to use the non-us airways terminals as a history display . 
3		acai is the new froyo ? <sssss> i joined the line for a free acai bowl mostly because i never queue for free anything and thought my bucket list should include doing so just once . <sssss> the atmosphere is sort of the mullet of snack shops : jamba juice-like in the front and medical-office-like in the back . <sssss> for a while in the line , i was worried that i 'd accidentally queued for free botox or pedicures or weird treatments that involved cucumbers and mild electric currents . <sssss> the acai bowl , when finally achieved , was really good . <sssss> it 's sweet-tart in a refreshing way -- it does actually taste roughly the red-purple shade that it is -- as it 's basically a fruit smoothie soft-serve . <sssss> the five-ounce bowl comes with slices of banana , berries , and a sprinkling of granola that 's useful for absorbing the last melted bits of soft-serve . <sssss> in the relentless sun of suburban tempe , it has the magic taste of feeling about five years younger , deeply wise and earnest -lrb- if not actually in touch with the spirit of yoga masters -rrb- , and in need of flowing garments with fringes . <sssss> when not a free offering , these are ungodly expensive . <sssss> they 're probably also little calorie bombs on the same scale as froyo . <sssss> if i were at this shopping center again , i 'd have another on my own dime because tempe is , for me , a vast beige suburban wasteland of dehydration that i need calories of refreshing happiness to endure , and these calories are extremely refreshing and happy . <sssss> if it were where i change buses on the way home from work , though , it would n't be a habitual stop . 
3		went for dinner with a friend . <sssss> vegetable deluxe was good but not great . <sssss> service was good until we finished our dinner . <sssss> when we continued to talk for about an hour we stopped getting drink refills and were ignored . <sssss> i would n't go out of my way to eat here but if i was hungry and in the area i would n't avoid it . 
3		the food is always good , i am only doing 3 stars because of the service . <sssss> after about 6 different visits , i can honestly say the service is terrible . <sssss> most recently we did take out , and well that took 30 waiting in the lobby after the time they said the food would be ready to actually get the food . <sssss> when we have sat down , the service is pretty slow and seems to take quite a while to get our food ! <sssss> the food is great and the portions are a good size , but wow , bring your patience !! <sssss> i hope they read the reviews about their service and step it up ! 
3		i 've been visiting , and thinking , and visiting again , and thinking , and finally , after a long deliberation , i am ready to issue a verdict . <sssss> ruling : it 's ok and a worthy stop in scottsdale for a pre-dinner beverage . <sssss> sure , i could front load my review with spicy adjectives , overinflated superlatives , some forced humor , and throw on an added star and hope for a rotd -lrb- come on , do n't pretend that you do n't know the formula -rrb- , but i am not selling my stars for a day on the big screen . <sssss> if it 's been said once , twice , and even thrice , need i repeat it ? <sssss> yes , because it is true -- this is not postino , and for that matter , this is not kaz . <sssss> it is a good , local spot to grab a glass of wine , maybe even with your mom , who may not be hip enough to chill at postino on central -lrb- which really requires little hipness , i mean they let me in -rrb- , or your dad , who may not be able to read in the dark at kaz , or maybe for that friend from gilbert , who you know , wants to walk the wide straight path of predictability . <sssss> predictability is n't bad ... in this case , that means a good wine selection -lrb- could rotate more -rrb- , full bar , usually one good draft or two out of 5 , decent cocktails , and decent food . <sssss> the food is not really what you come for . <sssss> the bruschetta is sub par , but the salads are above par . <sssss> and , i have to add , hummus with no flat bread or pita ?? <sssss> no . <sssss> no pita for you ! <sssss> service runs from friendly -lrb- read , management -rrb- to disillusioned and inattentive . <sssss> the latter tends to happen if you sit outside . <sssss> the last time i was in , i think grapes were crushed , olives were pressed , and chickpeas were ground ... at least they could have been . <sssss> often they have live music too , which runs from the somewhat awkward jazz guy who keeps talking to you to the motown wedding singer -- which on at least one occasion brought out near elaine benes-style dancing -- now that was worth the visit and waiting for the grape crushing . 
3		the hair that was baked into my muffin was not as delicious as some may believe . <sssss> watch for hairs before you bite into your muffin . <sssss> ;-rrb- luckily the service , especially the guy at the register -lrb- oliver -rrb- , were really nice and made the experience better . 
3		the downtown branch at 300 w jefferson street in downtown phoenix is located conveniently close to phoenix city hall and the municipal and county superior courts . <sssss> there 's an atm on the exterior facing jefferson , and a single drive up lane that you enter through the muni parking garage off 4th avenue to get to drive-up teller window with pneumatic tube service . <sssss> woe be unto you if you get trapped in the line for the teller window when someone ahead has complications or it 's busy inside and they 're short staffed as there 's no escape . <sssss> note also there is no drive-up atm at this location . <sssss> inside is a bright , clean interior with carpet and light colored laminate flooring installed in a remodel of perhaps a couple years years ago . <sssss> staff is kind of low-key courteous and competent , at everything i 've ever asked of them , though i do miss former branch manager dana both for being so approachable and for her outreach and helpfulness . <sssss> the great arizona real estate depression hit this credit union hard . <sssss> branches closed and hours shrank from 9 to 6 to back to 9 to 5 , and a $ 3 monthly checking fee was instituted which seems to have driven some members into a state of apoplexy , but i 'll take it over insolvency and losing the institution . <sssss> they got into trouble helping people who got into trouble with home loans and such in the sinking economy , so i try to not be too begrudging of the nominal fee , especially when there is no charge for the great convenience of online bill payment through the credit union , as opposed to mailing or delivering individual checks or having to go to every utility or other creditor 's web site individually . <sssss> i just applied for and got a loan to consolidate my debt and have some windows replaced . <sssss> i was pleased with the ease and speed with which the loan was approved and the great interest rate , though having been a customer there for 10-11 years , all my info - -lrb- maybe too much info ! -rrb- <sssss> was on hand and readily accessible . <sssss> with thanks to alex , it was a breeze . <sssss> if i am not more effusive it 's just because i have yet to find any institution that is `` as good as it gets '' compared to secu of nc , where i have been a member for just over 30 years , and service has always been extraordinary . 
3		in short : too chic for its own good , food is ok , ambiance is unique : for good or worse . <sssss> i went here on a whim because frankly the place looks frekin cool . <sssss> the atmosphere is always happening and lots of good looking people just hanging around . <sssss> it 's definitely chic and unique , but it feels like that 's where things go wrong . <sssss> the day i went the music was really loud , it was pretty good selection but it was way too loud . <sssss> i had a hard time hearing my friends , i felt like az88 was more of a bar pretending to be a restaurant . <sssss> the interior decorations had a liberace on crack feeling -lrb- life sized rhinestone studded dogs ??? -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> the drink menu was great and imaginative , i tried a couple of cocktails . <sssss> the food was ok , nothing to write home about but nothing to complain either . <sssss> portions was on the smaller side for the price . <sssss> they had a chocolate tart that was pretty amazing , the highlight of my evening . <sssss> i might go there again just for that . <sssss> i think this is a great place to go have a drink and hangout , not much of a restaurant , it 's just too much attention on everything else and not enough about the food . 
3		yes , this restaurant is beautiful and the wait staff was spot on but as some previous reviews mentioned , this place will give you some serious sticker shock . <sssss> you are definitely paying for the atmosphere here . <sssss> the food , well , it was good but did not blow me away . <sssss> one standout however was a roll they call a `` large roll '' shrimp , avocado , egg & vegetables . <sssss> it was not a roll i would have ever ordered but my dinner guest thought it sounded good and to my surprise it was and at $ 4.95 was reasonable . 
3		we loved the idea of this cafe . <sssss> locally sourced food and a changing menu based on freshly available products . <sssss> he had the bbq sliders and i had the chicken panini . <sssss> the bbq sliders were done well and the bun used was fresh and tasty . <sssss> the chicken panini was cooked well and the red onions were a great touch . <sssss> the sides were the semi-missed out on piece of the puzzle . <sssss> the feta and bean salad was just okay , not bad , but not as good . <sssss> considering that it was roughly $ 10.50 for the sliders and $ 13 for the panini , it was too much money for the offerings given -lrb- total $ 23.50 for just two sandwich plates - no drinks , no dessert -rrb- . <sssss> they had stewart root beer , which was definitely a bonus in my fiancee 's book ! <sssss> overall : b we would n't mind giving this place another try , but considering the price tag for just sandwiches with just okay sides - we most likely will try other options in the downtown phoenix area ! 
3		it 's walmart . <sssss> we all know we 're there for the prices and most of the time they undercut every other store by at least $ 0.01 . <sssss> this is a supercenter version of walmart , which means it has all kinds of extra stuff , like home/garden , furniture , electronics , vision center , and an auto shop -lrb- good for oil changes and batteries -rrb- . <sssss> i have found the supercenters to be more pleasant than the regular walmarts in the area . <sssss> this one can get pretty busy at times and although there are 37 registers , only 4 or so are ever open , so the checkout lines are long . <sssss> if you have certain gps units made by garmin , the speaker does n't know how to pronounce walmart and will say something like `` whale-mart '' or `` veil-mart . '' <sssss> this is the main reason i make trips to veilmart every so often . 
3		if you 're looking for a quazi-healthy , fast casual lunch spot , zoes is your spot . <sssss> it 's easy and great for a work week lunch . <sssss> it 's nothing that exciting from an ambiance perspective but the food is good -lrb- not great -rrb- , it does the trick and wo n't break the bank . <sssss> i usually get the chicken salad sandwich which carmelized onions . <sssss> my girlfriend always gets the protein plate which looks good too . <sssss> plus , every item comes with chips and a side of your choice -lrb- slaw , potato salad , pilaf , etc. -rrb- my favorite part about zoe 's you ask ? <sssss> that diet dr. pepper is part of the soda fountain selection . <sssss> divine . 
3		went for the first time on a saturday evening and i do n't think i 've ever had as much fun at dinner before . <sssss> i had never heard of the restaurant before and have to admit i was leery about combining chicken and waffles for dinner . <sssss> just reading the menu had me laughing so hard i was nearly in tears . <sssss> i ordered the betty boop which is a breast & a waffle . <sssss> the breading was tasty and the chicken was fall of the bone tender . <sssss> pricing was reasonable and the experience was overall good . 
3		ulta is pretty average in every state -- higher than regular retail , but usually not worth it anyway . <sssss> other beauty stores have more quality of products . <sssss> some of the stuff this place sells is just ehhh . <sssss> this ulta is very organized , however , with a polite staff and a salon . <sssss> it 's not too crowded either . <sssss> i went in here to buy a curling wand , but i helped myself out in the store by looking up reviews on the product i wanted ! <sssss> the good thing is that the product is awesome : -rrb- 
3		meh . <sssss> that 's all i can say about this place . <sssss> they redid this bar and reopened in about a month ago , but i have to admit that it 's nothing all that special anymore . <sssss> it used to feel so exclusive ; low lighting , small bar , max capacity of about 40 . <sssss> but now it seems like any other hoity-toity bar in scottsdale . <sssss> it was loud , there were tv 's above the bar playing sports , and the entire drink menu has changed . <sssss> just not what i was wanting when going to jade bar . <sssss> the only saving grace of this experience was that the bartenders have no issues whatsoever with making the old go-to drinks from their previous menu . <sssss> i asked our cocktail waitress about a jalapeno martini i had last time i was there that was no longer on the menu and she said , `` no problem ! <sssss> we can make that right up for you ! '' <sssss> i 'm sad to see the old jade bar go , and unfortunately i probably wo n't be back simply for the fact that there are about a dozen of this kind of bar within walking distance from my apartment , and without the special feel that jade bar once had there 's no reason the drive all the way up there anymore . 
3		overall a decent g-pub brought to you by eddie v 's restaurants . <sssss> the good : fresh brioche , tasty roast beef , juicy suckling pig , amazing 110 minute egg , beautiful decor , good location the bad : flour tortilla taco , not so interesting salmon rillettes the ugly : lame music , awkward service , limited menu they put forth a good effort and i 'm hoping phoenicians will take to something besides your average boring fox restaurant concepts fare . <sssss> i 'd totally come in here to grab a beer and a nice charcuterie plate . <sssss> for the love of all that is holy , please play some interesting music . <sssss> and please , if i hear the term `` head -lrb- or snout -rrb- to tail '' or `` farm to table '' one more time i 'm going to puke . <sssss> it 's been done to death guys , and you 're about 3 years too late . <sssss> i did n't experience one thing at the shop that would exemplify either concept . 
3		we went to dinner there on a sunday and we were the only ones in there for most of our dinner . <sssss> downtown phoenix can be somewhat quiet on the weekends , so this was no surprise . <sssss> the service was great as was the food . <sssss> i had a pizza and if you like thin , crispy crust you will enjoy the pizza as well . <sssss> the music was a little loud for a sunday dinner , especially since we were pretty much the only ones in the restaurant . <sssss> i will go again , probably during the week so i can get a taste of what it is like when it is busy !! <sssss> overall ... decent meal ! 
3		tasty in that oily , gonna-mess-you-up-tomorrow sense of the word . <sssss> inexpensive and generous portion sizes . <sssss> had the family meal of 3 entrees , rice and lo mein for 4 people for $ 20 . <sssss> general chicken , pepper beef , and pork spare ribs - not the most authentic perhaps and maybe that 's why i 'm only so-so on the place , but we 've only ourselves to blame for the selections . 
3		not super cheap ... parking lot sucks ... never had anything bad there but portion wise ... i guess i have expected more at times for the menu price . <sssss> tasty food and quick , friendly and attentive service ... always good if you want a quick but tasty meal . <sssss> lobster tacos ... golden . 
3		had breakfast here . <sssss> it 's pretty much your standard , run of the mill breakfast place ... when you walk in it reminds me of a denny 's type of place . <sssss> the service was decent , not fantastic and the food was standard ... better than denny 's though . <sssss> it was fresh and filled my belly . <sssss> took a little flagging down to get more coffee but nothing that would stop me from coming again . <sssss> i love my breakfast and this ... well it did the trick . <sssss> nothing was overly greasy ... eggs cooked to perfection ... but its pretty hard to mess up eggs and bacon . <sssss> if i were in this area i would consider this an option ... again ... not the best but it was decent . 
3		what can i say about the yh ? <sssss> it was n't a bad place , a little loud though . <sssss> it felt like a sports bar with all the sports on the tv 's . <sssss> nice music though . <sssss> i ordered the mac and cheese with chicken and bacon . <sssss> they could 've given me a little more bacon , but i was not at all disappointed . <sssss> the parmsesan cheese fries with truffle oil were outta this world ! <sssss> if i go there again , i 'll just order those fries . <sssss> i do n't have alot to say about the yh . <sssss> the prices were a little high , but affordable . <sssss> they were a little skimpy on the wine . <sssss> overall , my experience was average . 
3		my brother in law gave us a travel zoo coupon so we thought we would try it . <sssss> wife had the ribs and i had the beef wellington . <sssss> the ribs were a little fatty and i did n't really like the caramelized onion on the wellington but overall it was ok . <sssss> . <sssss> we had great service and the waiters wine suggestion was fantastic . <sssss> -lrb- it was half off with the coupon . -rrb- <sssss> the beer battered green beans and the sweet potatoes fries were also very good . <sssss> if we did n't have the coupon we would have spent $ 115 for the two of us so it was a good deal . 
3		fun bar to hang out at ... cornhole on the patio . <sssss> great location . 
3		the food was good but the service was sloooooooow . <sssss> i 'm not sure that we will be giving this place another shot . <sssss> the food was n't so amazing that it warranted how long we had to wait for our food -lrb- 40 + minutes -rrb- . 
3		i like the clarendon a lot . <sssss> there 's a rooftop bar , a really awesome pool , a cool feel to it , a lounge , and they have events that seem fun . <sssss> my friends and i come here for lunch from time to time , and i 've been in the evening a few times as well . <sssss> the bar service is ok depending on the night in which you go . <sssss> i 've gone a lot of saturday nights and had great service most of the time , although there was one night the service was incredibly slow . <sssss> i like the drinks and have eaten in the cafe just a few times . <sssss> the dishes i 've ordered are just ok , nothin ' special . <sssss> the fruit salad had a lot of apples and very few strawberries -lrb- yes i know apples are cheaper -rrb- . <sssss> i had recently ordered a crepes dish that was supposed to have a specific cream sauce with plantains . <sssss> i was disappointed to see that the crepes were covered with cheap-o spray can whipped cream and bananas ! <sssss> not the same . <sssss> i was craving some plantains . <sssss> the guac is ok with greasy chips , but i 've had better restaurant guac . <sssss> i typically enjoy a sangria or a wine . <sssss> one of the people in my group had ordered a drink and said it sucked , though . <sssss> i like the ambience of the place , mainly because i am usually with a large group of friends . <sssss> it can get loud during certain evenings . <sssss> i used to come a lot of tues evenings but have n't been a while . <sssss> saturdays can get busy , as expected , but the lounge is a chill area to hang out while waiting for a table , and the wait staff leave us alone till the table is ready . <sssss> i love the rooftop bar area , especially during the cooler months . <sssss> sometimes the heat lamps are n't on , though . <sssss> it 's open late , and it 's usually not busy . 
3		thanks for having happy hour sonic . 
3		i 'm surprised r bar rates so high . <sssss> the food is terrible , so it must be for the patio . <sssss> i have been several times and the food is always mediocre at best . <sssss> the service is notably slow too . <sssss> yes , they have an awesome patio but r bar has lots of competition . <sssss> there are so many great places in town that have wonderful patios and great food and service . 
3		pretty good going down , but the fire is still coming up on me 5 hours later ! <sssss> i guess i should have gone with the mild instead of hot . 
3		it is not often i give this high a rating to a corporate chain place . <sssss> this place is good though , they immediately recognized that we had no idea what to do and walked us through the who order process . <sssss> food , bbq bacon and cheddar burger , smash fries and a side salad ; came out quick and were tasty . <sssss> side salad had actual greens on it !! <sssss> wow , most burger joints just throw iceberg on a plate and assume you are annoying for ordering salad . <sssss> i was n't super happy with the kid 's straws -lrb- straws cut in half , which ruins the illusion of sterility completely -rrb- and the bathroom was a mess -lrb- despite the sign claiming the importance of a clean bathroom -rrb- . <sssss> i 'll check it out again if i am running errands and hungry , as i was today . 
3		i work within walking distance to firehouse subs . <sssss> i do n't frequent it much because it is only okay in my opinion . <sssss> today i had the best sandwich i 've had from firehouse yet . <sssss> i had the steak and cheese -lrb- minus cheese cause i 'm lactose intolerant -rrb- , with peppers and onions on wheat . <sssss> delicious but i 've had a stomach ache since . <sssss> i guess that 's not saying much because i get a stomach ache whenever i eat almost anywhere . <sssss> the italian is pretty good too . <sssss> slightly expensive . <sssss> oh , and if you are getting their cherry limeade from the machine make sure you put sprite in it as well , because i 'm pretty sure it 's just cherry syrup . 
3		i tried the half of the restaurant that is clearly similar to panda express , so i 'll write the review from that standpoint . <sssss> the lo mein vs panda 's chow mein is two different worlds . <sssss> holy hell is the lo mein better . <sssss> that 's where the good part ends . <sssss> the terriyake chicken was bland and dry . <sssss> the orange chicken was over cooked and extremely sticky . <sssss> one thing i will say is that you get a ton of food for not very much money . <sssss> i spent 7.50 ish and got a heaping so large , an anorexic person would n't be able to lift it ! 
3		this place is n't perfect , but the things it does right are pretty spot-on in making it a good breakfast place . <sssss> the omelettes are bad , the smoothies are pretty dandy , and the breakfast meats are cooked right despite being a bit too rich -lrb- as if they were cooked in butter along with the grease from the meat -rrb- . <sssss> however , the burrito with the chorizo -lrb- and i swear there were chicharrones in it too -rrb- was the ultimate item . <sssss> if you only visit this place once , get the breakfast burrito , it will make you want to come back for more , and when you do , get the eggs florentine , you wo n't regret it . <sssss> oh , and for those who love spicy sauce , they serve and excellent chipotle habanero sauce on the table that you can top your foods off with . <sssss> great thing they also have the misters outside to cool you off on their outside patio . <sssss> in other words , eat breakfast here . 
3		i will never understand the overabundance of `` mom and pop '' pizza shops in peoria . <sssss> it almost seems like a practical joke . <sssss> dozens of `` local '' pizza shops , all with different names and menu layouts , all living on the same street , peddling the same food made with the same ingredients to the same curious customers , who keep shifting from one pizzeria to the next hoping to find something `` different '' before they ultimately settle on whichever one is more atmospherically pleasing to them . <sssss> this is not to say ballpark pizza is n't worth a try . <sssss> in fact , of all the copycat pizza parlors in the city , it 's one of the better ones . <sssss> while their pizza is n't worth writing home about , it 's pretty low on the grease factor and tastes quite nice when dipped in ranch . <sssss> it 's pretty inexpensive , too . <sssss> a large with two sodas and some wings should n't run you more than 20-25 . <sssss> the wings are what ballpark 's known for . <sssss> they make a certain sauce that is so intensely hot that they have a wall of fame for anyone who can eat half a dozen of them within a certain time limit . <sssss> one of my friends has his picture posted on the wall . <sssss> i keep asking them for a `` hall of famer '' discount whenever we show up . <sssss> we never get it . <sssss> oh , and the rules stipulate that while consuming the wings , you may drink whatever you think will help stave off the burn . <sssss> i 've seen guys pounding shots of ranch to keep the burn at bay . <sssss> just a sense of what to expect at ballpark . <sssss> it 's sports-themed , but to the extent of other `` sports restaurants '' that blast six or seven tvs all playing different games or whatever the hell espn has on . <sssss> the tvs just loud enough so that you can watch it and carry on a conversation . <sssss> i was at ballpark when michael vick was first investigated for that whole dogfighting thing . <sssss> then , a couple of months later , i was at pullano 's , which is literally down the street , when he gave his public apology . <sssss> i need to find something new to eat . <sssss> personally i prefer ballpark as a lunch spot . <sssss> it 's fairly uncrowded , even during the lunch rush . <sssss> the food comes to you fairly quickly , and the staff are always walking about the dining room looking to hook you up with extra napkins or whatever else you may need . <sssss> it 's the little things that make a pizza shop . 
3		i was one of the first patrons for lunch , i park in the lot on the side , open the door and walk in ... and get fairly rudely told by one of the servers that i 've just entered the wrong door and if i would like to go to the front and wait for the hostess , i can be seated . <sssss> not the best start to the meal . <sssss> i ordered a bunch of food figuring i 'd sample it all and decide if i like the restaurant enough to bring my wife by at another time . <sssss> first i got the hamburger w/bacon and gruyere . <sssss> by the time it got to me , the bun was completely soggy under the burger . <sssss> the bread was too soft and porous , and there was nothing between the burger and the bread . <sssss> the biggest crime here was that the menu said it was served w/an aioli ... and it was , on the side . <sssss> if they had just put a nice thin coat of it on the bun then the juices would n't have turned my bun into a fall apart mess . <sssss> the crispy onions on top were nice though , and the burger was cooked a nice medium . <sssss> however , i also got a side of the fingerling potatos ... disaster . <sssss> they were charred little briquette lumps , which was a shame , because i had really been looking forward to them . <sssss> only about 1/4 were even edible . <sssss> second , i ordered the cheese flatbread , thinking it would be like it said on the menu , flatbread w/cheese and herbs . <sssss> however they made the mistake a lot of lesser restaurants make , they brought me a pizza . <sssss> look , quick easy difference between pizza and flatbread ... sauce . <sssss> if you put tomato sauce and cheese on it , it is a flatbread pizza . <sssss> if you mean flatbread pizza you should say that on the menu . <sssss> no big , it still tasted good , except again ... soggy . <sssss> like , fall apart soggy . <sssss> a shame . <sssss> third , i went for the cheesecake for dessert . <sssss> first problem w/this ? <sssss> it took 15 minutes to get my cheesecake . <sssss> not even kidding . <sssss> they were n't that busy , and my server stopped by twice while i was waiting to refill my water . <sssss> not once did he say , `` hey , that 'll be up in just a moment '' or offer any explanation . <sssss> weird . <sssss> second problem , when it finally does come , it is a bell jar with an inch of cheesecake in the bottom , a combination of canned fruit and candied nuts on top of that , and about 3 inches of whipped cream filling the top of the jar . <sssss> do you have any idea how hard that is to eat ? <sssss> ridiculous . <sssss> i was angry because actually tasted good , but it was so hard to eat ! <sssss> in my book , 3 near misses . <sssss> they 're so close to being a really good restaurant , but right now they just are n't there . 
3		ca n't let this slide with such high rings . <sssss> decent food , but nothing wonderful here . 
3		yummy breakfast food . <sssss> only three stars because the service here can be pretty slow . <sssss> definately great pancakes and a very nice atmosphere when it 's not too busy 
3		went for lunch here today for the first time ever . <sssss> atmosphere was nice , sleek and streamlined . <sssss> not fussy . <sssss> the menu was simple but a little pricey . <sssss> average lunch for one with an ice tea will run you $ 30 . <sssss> waiter was nice , knowledgable and friendly . <sssss> love the open kitchen concept . <sssss> live music from 11am to 1pm on saturday . <sssss> also a brunch menu . <sssss> i ordered a pizza and the zuchinni chips . <sssss> very tasty ! <sssss> the one and only and huge downfall is the infestation of flies !!!!!!! <sssss> it really made our entire lunch unenjoyable ! <sssss> when we complained to the waiter about the flies , he commented by saying , `` yeah , everybody has been complaining about that '' then he went on to say how this year flies are supposed to be the worst ever in history . <sssss> so , should i take that as a hint , that of i eat here again i will have to share my food with the fly family ??!!!! <sssss> there are too many great places i can eat in this area that i do n't need to deal with swooshing flies off of my food every three seconds ! <sssss> so unappetizing and it ca n't be sanitary especially with the open kitchen concept and the fact that veggies were stacked in open bins on the prep table and bread was stacked in the open air . <sssss> hopefully i wo n't be picking baby bot flies out of my neck in a few months . <sssss> i do n't think i will be back . <sssss> it is a shame because everything else was great . <sssss> although , jeff goldblum would love the place i think ! 
3		daytime visit and it looked a bit sketchy from the outside and was a bit nervous parking in the back of the building . <sssss> inside did n't seem to be renovated much from whatever restaurant was there before . <sssss> staff was polite . <sssss> buffet was reasonably priced and had numerous options , with quite a few being indian dishes that are uncommon at other buffets in town . <sssss> dosa was just just ok , as was the naan . <sssss> the fried appetizers were not very fresh and some of the buffet area was a little messy . <sssss> place was very busy and filled with native indian customers , which is a very good sign in my book . 
3		i was disappointed by this place . <sssss> i got a flier on my door with a great deal for wings , pizza , and garlic knots for 20.99 . <sssss> i hopped on yelp and saw only positive reviews and got my hopes up for a delicious experience . <sssss> they quoted me 45-50 minutes for delivery , but it actually took 75 minutes for the food to arrive . <sssss> this was early on a tuesday afternoon . <sssss> the garlic knots were blackened to a crisp on the bottom , which ruined the flavor . <sssss> they were loaded up with butter , garlic salt , and parmesan , which can be a good or bad thing depending on your tastes . <sssss> i personally found them a bit too salty . <sssss> the pizza was a good value for the price . <sssss> the sauce is really tasty . <sssss> i ordered pepperoni and extra cheese . <sssss> the pizza did n't seem very cheesy though . <sssss> however it was already cold and looked a day old by the time it was delivered so that could have something to do with it . <sssss> the wings ... oh wait , they forgot to deliver my wings ! <sssss> i called them back for the 3rd time -lrb- first to order , second to make sure that they got my order -rrb- and the driver returned 30 minutes later with my wings . <sssss> after two hours , i finally had my complete order . <sssss> initially , instead of the wings , i was given the saddest gyro i have ever seen . <sssss> three strips of meat and a whole lot of pita . <sssss> it was actually pretty tasty though . <sssss> thanks for the freebie , zio 's ! <sssss> the scrawny lil ' suicide wings will light your mouth on fire . <sssss> they were my favorite part of the meal . <sssss> i would go back for their $ 5 large pizza . <sssss> it 's just as good as any of the other cheapo pizza places with $ 5 pies . <sssss> just do n't expect anything special from zio 's . 
3		the scottsdale quarter is grown and has really become a happening place . <sssss> we got to primebar early enough on saturday that we were seated immediately in the rear bar . <sssss> nice atmosphere and plenty of room . <sssss> beer and wine selection was good , a lot of local stuff which i appreciate . <sssss> we split the prime rib sliders and the primebar burger . <sssss> burger was great -lrb- huge -rrb- and well put together . <sssss> sliders definitely left room for improvement . <sssss> the meat was so minimal it was basically bread and some horseradish . <sssss> service was good , food and drinks came out quick . <sssss> we 'll try it again , the burger showed promise but we 'll just avoid the sliders . 
3		pretty darn tasty but you better like carne asada as it 's damn near the only thing on the menu . <sssss> yes that 's an exaggeration but the menu is ridiculously limited and nothing but pork and beef . <sssss> the horchata is excellent . 
3		dive bar with decent drink prices and bands . <sssss> i like the large outdoor patio and they usually have some interesting art/music events . <sssss> i normally avoid this place because they always have a cover charge . <sssss> sometimes i just wan na stop in for a drink and not commit to the whole evening . <sssss> all in all a great spot if you 're looking to listen to some good local music and do n't wan na spend another night at casey 's or yucca . 
3		pretty good food in a nice looking restaurant . <sssss> it 's got a hip vibe and the menu to match . <sssss> well presented hummus with crispy toasted pita bread , a nicely garnished green salad with walnuts and cranberries to start . <sssss> where things fell apart a bit was in the mushroom chicken entree . <sssss> i loved the sauce , but it turned completely soupy to the point of drowning the poor tender chicken . <sssss> all in all a good meal , with two people we got out for around $ 75 with tip . <sssss> not bad but not a great value . 
3		i come really only for the sticky buns . <sssss> the rest of the food is okay . <sssss> not bad , not great . <sssss> i think if you came with a romantic date , a nice meal under the stars is well worth it . <sssss> with a large group , this place could get pricey for generally american fare that is done better at lons at hermosa inn i think . <sssss> again , try it out for lunch and then see if its worth committing to for dinner . 
3		ordered for delivery from this location yesterday . <sssss> the guy on the phone was friendly and efficient - he gave me a discount , which was nice -lrb- but did n't specify how much or for what -rrb- . <sssss> the delivery was on time , maybe even a little early , and the guy was personable . <sssss> i thought the cheese pizza was just ok , but everyone who had the veggie pizza had great things to say about it -lrb- i 'm of the school of thought that veggies belong in salads , not on pizza , but to each his own -rrb- . <sssss> i 've had better pizza , but the folks were friendly and if i was in the area , i 'd give it another go . 
3		not like the one on 7th ave menudo , but fry bread was soooo good . 
3		i 'm not a fan of culver 's food . <sssss> everything that i 've ever had has been super greasy and not very tasty . <sssss> if i 'm going to have a super greasy burger , i 'll pick 5 guys or in & out everytime over these guys . <sssss> however , the turtle custard desert is to die for . <sssss> so it 's kind of hard to give this place a rating . <sssss> i 'd say 4-5 stars for dessert , 1-2 stars for the food . 
4		took at party of 11 tonight to celebrate 3 birthdays . <sssss> arrived 5:15 pm was told we had 45-60 min wait . <sssss> it was crazy busy ! <sssss> we waited the full 60 min , but was told they were having trouble getting a big enough spot to seat us all together & it would be 10-15 more minutes . <sssss> we were compensated for our time , so we gladly waited . <sssss> the manger took great care of us & our waitress was superb ! <sssss> we placed orders for the chicago style pan numero-one pizza while we waited . <sssss> they were ready by the time we got seated . <sssss> big dinner & caesar salads , thin crust sproccoli pizza were fresh , delicious , & very flavorful ! <sssss> top off the evening with our favorite part of the meal ... pizza cookies , one of each please ! <sssss> i must say , white chocolate macadamia nut & peanut butter are my favorite ! <sssss> they will even do half/half for you too ! <sssss> each birthday gal/guy got a free pazookie !! <sssss> yeah ! <sssss> we have been here several times . <sssss> every time we come , we are very well taken care of by the wait staff , not to mention management pops by to check on us to make sure we are happy & satisfied . <sssss> already looking forward to our next visit ! 
4		classic gyro joint food ! <sssss> ca n't go wrong with the original gyro , with a greek salad . <sssss> . <sssss> being the mega carnivore i am , i opt for extra meat ! <sssss> :-rrb- order some extra tzatziki sauce if you 're a fan of it . <sssss> . <sssss> i tend to enjoy my gyros swimming in it . <sssss> also , the building itself is a great example of classic mid-century `` googie '' architecture . <sssss> glad to have such a cool little spot a block away . 
4		it 's more liberty than market . <sssss> i was just back from vacation and hoping to buy some ready made food for my empty fridge - my options were beer and cold salads . <sssss> so instead , i sat down and had a meal there . <sssss> i ordered a salad and my partner in crime had a grilled cheese sandwich , both were tasty . <sssss> very cool minimalist decor but the tables and soda station were messy in the rush of the lunch hour . <sssss> the service was friendly - you go up to the counter , order your food and they bring it out to you , you grab your own drinks - it 's not the type of place where you 're being waited on . <sssss> the restrooms were unisex and then had an outer area where the boys and girls washed their hands together , i thought that was nice because you do n't have to commit to going into a restroom just to wash your hands before your meal . <sssss> the sinks do n't have a mirror in front of you , it 's a window that looks outside - i liked that little detail . 
4		food and service was good 
4		this was the hotel my guests and i stayed at for my wedding . <sssss> even if you do n't include a group block rate , the prices at the hilton garden inn are incredible for north scottsdale . <sssss> this may be one of the cheaper hotels in the area . <sssss> the staff is also easy to work with and very accommodating . <sssss> lexy , the sales manager , was wonderful about addressing all of our concerns about reservations and arranging transportation for our guests . <sssss> the rooms are clean and spacious , and each has a microwave and mini fridge . <sssss> the shower had great water pressure , and i have no complaints about the comfort of the bed . <sssss> i did n't watch very much tv , but i believe there was a full list of channels not just the standard hotel package of 10 to 20 channels and hbo . <sssss> the outdoor pool is well shaded by the building and trees around it , making it a perfect spot to cool off on a warm summer afternoon . <sssss> if you 're looking for a basic hotel , this hilton garden inn will surpass needs . <sssss> if you need more amenities , there are several resorts in just minutes away . 
4		when we do order for delivery - - it 's always pei wok . <sssss> mostly fresh , and very quick delivery . <sssss> the last few times we 've ordered it * very * spicy and they either add the hot chili sauce as a side or they spice it up fairly well . <sssss> very reliable and yummy for delivery ! 
4		we stayed at royal palms this past weekend for the 4th year in a row to celebrate my husband 's birthday . <sssss> normally we do go t cooks , but usually for dinner . <sssss> this year , we decided to go for breakfast , and boy and i glad we did ! <sssss> the food is always good at t cooks . <sssss> we 've enjoyed dinner here a couple times and they always treat you nicely and make a special occasion even more special . <sssss> so , our breakfast was great . <sssss> i had the croissant sandwich and my husband had the pesto omelet . <sssss> he loved the pesto flavor in his omelet , as well as the english muffin it came with and the apple cinnamon jam . <sssss> it really was fabulous . <sssss> my croissant sandwich was to die for . <sssss> i loved how they mixed the cheese in the eggs and the eggs were cooked just right - not overdone . <sssss> the waitress was so nice , she noticed it was my husband 's bday and brought him a plate that said `` happy birthday '' and had some truffles . <sssss> love , love , love t cooks and royal palms - you must go ! 
4		i have come to this store many times because it 's a pillar of mill ave. . <sssss> they 've been here as long as i can remember and i 've always known it for comfort , quality -lrb- note , not hip , sexy , and cheap -rrb- made shoes ... so , for those looking for hip , sexy , cheap shoes . <sssss> . <sssss> not for you . <sssss> they do have some cute shoes that are n't ` granny ' looking , but then again ` granny ' may be all in the eye of the beholder . <sssss> . <sssss> at least for me , i have frequently seen cute shoes here that are usually over $ 80 , so it 's not like i buy gobs of them . <sssss> but , when my mother in law needed quality , comfortable , long-lasting shoes for her job , i found her the perfect pair here ... not cheap , but i 'm pretty confident her shoes will last her a long time considering the manufacturer and quality of the sole and leather . <sssss> expensive , non stiletto-sexy girl shoes , but comfortable , quality-made shoes and personal customer service from this pillar of mill ave. . <sssss> i 'm a fan ! 
4		being a good husband , i volunteered to take my wife to another day at sister 's closet . <sssss> it takes her hours to go through everything - and i 'm usually left to find something to do to kill time . <sssss> fortunately , they now have an einstein 's in the same shopping area . <sssss> a lifesaver !! <sssss> i was able to have several cups of coffee , some wonderful onion bagels with cream cheese , and to casually read the newspaper without being hurried and feeling i was taking up space . <sssss> it is large , clean , and the workers a cheerful and helpful . <sssss> the only glitch was that on one of my bagel orders , they lost the order !! <sssss> not a big deal - i was n't going anywhere - so once they figured out the order got lost in cyberspace - they immediately re-entered it and brought it to my table . <sssss> so now i 'm covered - if my wife has to be at sisters early in the morning , i can relax at einsteins !! 
4		go ! <sssss> go quickly ! <sssss> we went last night for yelp easts and everything practically is on the yelps eats menu . <sssss> my husband and i both started out with the onion tart , my friend had the escargot and her husband had the pate . <sssss> the tart was fabulous and huge -lrb- perfect size for a light lunch -rrb- . <sssss> the escargot were a bit of a disappointment . <sssss> nothing bad but not as good as she hoped . <sssss> the pate appetizer came as two slices rather than just one , a very generous portion . <sssss> we all tried it and it was good -lrb- and it 's made in-house -rrb- . <sssss> for our entree my friend and i each ordered the scallops , my husband ordered the duck and my friend 's husband got the steak frites . <sssss> the scallops were phenomenal . <sssss> they came on a bed of house made organic creamed corn . <sssss> delicious to the last bite . <sssss> my husband loved his duck . <sssss> it was pounded thin and panko crusted and served on a bed of horseradish spaetzle . <sssss> granted , he loves anything panko crusted , but he did say the duck was good . <sssss> i had a bite , but the panko crust turned me off -lrb- i dislike anything panko crusted -rrb- . <sssss> the steak frites was a huge portion and so delicious and bloody . <sssss> for dessert we each ordered something different . <sssss> i had the macaroon , my husband got the blueberry tart , my friend ordered the beignets and her husband ordered the sticky toffee pudding . <sssss> everyone thoroughly enjoyed their desserts . <sssss> mine -lrb- the macaroons -rrb- came layered with two different kinds of mousses - dark chocolate and maybe caramel . <sssss> it got a little too sweet towards the end , but it 's dessert . <sssss> par for the course . <sssss> the beignets came a huge pile of them with three sauces -lrb- one of them nutella ! -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> i will definitely come back here again and i 'd like to try breakfast here too . <sssss> the food was great and the atmosphere near perfect -lrb- they need to ditch the tvs - they really do n't belong there -rrb- . <sssss> our next yelp eats meal at digestif has a lot to measure up to now . 
4		the menu at bj 's offers an extensive variety of entrees . <sssss> my mother and i decided on a lite lunch so we ordered the soup and salad . <sssss> the salad was pretty basic but the minestrone soup was delicious ! <sssss> and so much for the lite lunch , since it was all you can eat soup we did indulge . <sssss> bj 's is a popular restaurant and at prime time hours does fill up fast . 
4		a place that inspires me to decorate my house like the bathroom must be reviewed ! <sssss> modern burger is an adorable little restaurant , perfect for happy hour after an afternoon shopping at fashion square . <sssss> the sliders , fries , ice cream sandwiches , and chopped turkey salad are perfect . <sssss> everything from the portion size to the price to the presentation is wonderful . <sssss> they have changed their happy hour since my last visit , so i need to go back soon . <sssss> but i will be going back and that is the important thing . 
4		arrived on a sunday around 1pm about a month ago and was promptly seated in the dining area . <sssss> if you prefer , you can also visit their connected take out area . <sssss> service excellent , although on a sunday there were several screaming children and very loud large groups , but that 's expected when you eat out so ca n't complain too much . <sssss> if you are a fan of pesto , you will be pleasantly surprised to taste the complimentary pesto w/warm , fresh bread . <sssss> i could have just ate that all afternoon ! <sssss> delicious ! <sssss> i ordered tomato bisque which was the absolute best tomato bisque ever ! <sssss> if i were in the area i might try this place again , although there are so many other nice restaurants in the area i 've yet to try that i 'd probably opt for one of those . 
4		have you had the kisras or the sweet potato/garlic fries at fez ? <sssss> if not ... go get some right now . <sssss> they are heavenly . <sssss> also , if you are in the mood for great mixed drinks , a trendy modern atmosphere and cute sexy boys everywhere this is the place for you . <sssss> if you are a chick the boys might not be looking back at you , but hey - nothing wrong with a little eye candy . <sssss> fez actually makes me excited about the dreaded light rail . <sssss> the train will go straight from my doorstep to fez . 
4		wow i really am glad groupon guided me to this place . <sssss> i was a little worried after reading some reviews but pleasently surprised that the place did n't stink as one stated and that even though food was pricey it was n't without merit . <sssss> for starters the bruschetta was great i am a huge fan of garlic and there was a lot of it . <sssss> after that came the dinner salad which had a creamy homemade italian dressing on it which was just awesome they should bottle that stuff up and sell it at the front . <sssss> finally my main course was veal lasagna yes that 's right veal mmmmm . <sssss> it was full of flavor and the portion was just right . <sssss> after all this i still had to try a dessert so i went with raspberry sorbet dipped in dark chocolate . <sssss> it was a nice refreshing way to end the meal . <sssss> this place would be a five star if it was n't for the a/c pumping the whole time when it was n't needed . <sssss> other than that i loved it and will totally go back . <sssss> it was one of the better italian places i have been to in the valley for food . 
4		love this hole in the wall place . <sssss> see it all the time but never went in always wondered . <sssss> went in with my boyfriend and we both agreed wed be back ! <sssss> the original wine burger tasted fresh and juicy not over powering with spices just right . <sssss> i loved the pub pickles was n't expecting the spiciness boyfriend did n't care for them because of that but i gobbled them down . <sssss> loved their green tea and the were very friendly . 
4		this place has been my go to spot for sushi lately . <sssss> i love the ambiance inside , good music , just enough tv 's for you to catch a score but not too many to distract you . <sssss> great service . <sssss> amazing prices for happy hour . <sssss> i still have yet to do karaoke here , just have n't had the chance but soon i will be rocking the mic with a stomach full of saki and japanese beer . <sssss> as far as the food , its good enough for me . <sssss> i feel like blue wasabi and maybe a couple other places has a bit better tasting sushi , but for what i pay at happy hour and the great time i have everytime i go here , it 's worth it fo sho ! 
4		i really like this place . <sssss> this place is a good place to come watch a game or ufc or just for getting some food . <sssss> they have tv 's everywhere and the bar is inside and goes outside for those of you who would like to enjoy a smoke at the bar like the good ol days you can do that here . <sssss> they have the game bags set up for anyone to play . <sssss> thay also have a ping pong table , pool table , and they even have a breathalizer in the hallway to the restrooms so you can make sure your ok to drive . <sssss> its cool and funny cause arizona is a 0 tollerance state so you can blow a .02 and be busted even thou the limit is .08 . <sssss> i know someone who was busted for blowing .02 . <sssss> anyway they have a huge patio with the firepits for the cooler weather and great drink specials . <sssss> i had the philly cheese steak and loved it . <sssss> they also have a good chicken philly . <sssss> cream cheese jalopeno poppers and wings are good to . <sssss> check it out ! 
4		amazing burgers ; like backyard bbq amazing ! <sssss> ... and awesome fries , too . <sssss> huge condiment bar -- but do n't go if you 're a germ freak or pay for everything in life with plastic : this place is n't for you . <sssss> no fancy seating or bright lights -- it 's tiny , you sit on old logs and there 's usually a line -- but do n't worry , it 's worth the wait . <sssss> no `` product uniformity '' here , but who cares -- they 're damn good ! 
4		this place is great . <sssss> a wonderful place to go to feel like you 're out of the city ... while staying in the city . <sssss> i wanted to get away on saturday and just chill , contemplate . <sssss> i went just after 6:00 pm . <sssss> walked around with my mp3 player and chilled by the lake listening to some righteous tunes . <sssss> i made my way to the hole in the rock to watch the sunset . <sssss> the amazing splash of late afternoon colors over the valley is nothing short of breathtaking . <sssss> i recommend this to anyone who needs to get away , or even a little spiritual replenishment . <sssss> just bring some water and your favorite music and you 're in for a meaningful experience 
4		i stopped in today for lunch and was impressed . <sssss> i had the spinach wraps with chicken and grilled veggies . <sssss> the wraps were super fresh & delicious and the veggies were good , too . <sssss> i 'll definitely be going back to try some of their other items . 
4		pretty nice decor -lrb- although it was freezing cold inside this evening -rrb- . <sssss> we had the tex mex pizza which was very good . <sssss> the food was a little overpriced , compared to most local pizza places , but it was better than most . <sssss> probably my fifth or sixth favorite pizza place in town as of right now . 
4		i really liked this place a lot . <sssss> very casual ... tv 's with news crankin ' , lots of seating , and just a nice place to getaway . <sssss> kinda reminds me a little of pei wei ... take your order at the front , pay and grab your number ... go sit down . <sssss> nice area for coffee and whatever else you need ... easy access to everything you need . <sssss> utensils , napkins , jellies , all the goodies . <sssss> i had just a plain breakfast which , surprisingly enough , most people seem to screw up pretty bad . <sssss> 2 eggs over medium , rosemary potatoes , bacon , and white toast . <sssss> loved it ... loved it ... loved it . 
4		their happy hour is great because it goes until 8pm , way later then most other places . <sssss> they also have a great happy hour selection and good prices . <sssss> their chicken nachos are great and gigantic ! <sssss> the turkey burger and sweet potato fries are also really good . <sssss> good prices for drinks as well 
4		we really enjoyed our meal at hopdoddy . <sssss> the concept was a little confusing when you first walk in as to what to do but once the hostess came to us and explained it we were fine . <sssss> i ordered the `` el diablo '' and it was cooked perfectly . <sssss> it is pretty spicy as a caution but nothing crazy . <sssss> my wife ordered the ahi tuna burger that was also very good aside from using too much wasabi so you may want to ask them to go light . <sssss> fries were pretty good and they have a decent beer selection . <sssss> my one gripe was the beer glasses they use . <sssss> kind of look like margarita glasses and they are very heavy . <sssss> overall though we really enjoyed ourselves and will come back . 
4		dined at rl on saturday night with the girls -lrb- wife , daughter , and m in law -rrb- . <sssss> surprised to see how busy it was for a saturday @ 6 but that 's the crowd they draw . <sssss> waited the quoted 20-25 and got seated and greetd by our `` seafood expert '' tim . <sssss> ordered the shrimp trio and got what i expected . <sssss> m in law not too happy with her fried shrimp size , but matches the price i quess . <sssss> very accomodating in getting the `` seafood hater ' daughter a plate of linguini with butter . <sssss> wifey had the cedar salmon grilled on a plank , very happy . <sssss> drinks were cold , cheddar bisquits were abundant ... overall good time . 
4		first impression as you enter is simple yet sophisticated . <sssss> amazing decor . <sssss> very tasty vegetarian options . <sssss> my date ordered a dish with some sort of shaved fish on the top that undulated ... at first i thought that the lights were flickering but no this food was moving but not alive . <sssss> freaky but in a good way 
4		okay , you either hate the chips or you love them . <sssss> i love them ! <sssss> we were pleased to see the new menu at aunt chilada 's ... finally some vegetarian options ! <sssss> the patio is awesome , you can chill in the sun , enjoy cold beers , and play bocce . <sssss> is it the best mexican food ? <sssss> no . <sssss> but it 's tasty , and that combined with the patio makes aunt chilada 's a great choice . 
4		if you 're looking for some great pho , this is definitely a place to check out . <sssss> it 's located right dab in a vietnamese shopping center , how can you really go wrong ? <sssss> i ordered the viet iced tea with cream which was a lot less sweet than the thai teas i 'm used to , it was surprising but still very delicious . <sssss> the appetizer ordered was the summer rolls which house a large hunk of spicy sausage in it , the sauce to dip it in was really sweet and did n't cling to the roll well , i think i 'd rather have had hoisin sauce with it . <sssss> i ordered the white meat combo noodle soup bowl . <sssss> this consisted of a couple of pieces of imitation crab , fish cake balls , shrimp , pork slices and calamari . <sssss> each was quite good in its own right except the imitation crap which had started to flake and come apart in the hot broth . <sssss> the broth by the way was fabulous , did n't overpower the meats but added enough flavor to them , much like a fondue broth , while still more than delicious enough to slurp the rest of the way through once all the solid bits were gone . <sssss> the reason i 'm not giving it 5 stars is even after showing we 've been around the block with vietnamese food we were constantly being given instructions on what was good and what newcomers to vietnamese cuisine should try . <sssss> i mean once is good service , but after the customer replies that they 've had it before do n't continue to treat them like newbie white devils ... some of us are a little more travelled than others , thanks . 
4		go west for fun adventure and good values . <sssss> west of the i17 that is . <sssss> with some convincing i got a few of my co workers to try this place . <sssss> from my office at 18th ave there are 12 mexican food places before we reach this lone asian buffet . <sssss> walk in and you pay $ 6.50 plus tax for all you can eat and drink soft drinks . <sssss> grab a plate and marvel at the eclectic mix of foods , many chinese favorites , some buffet usuals like the wide mix of fried foods and random jello deserts , and then discover the most out of place and best thing , garlic bread . <sssss> for veggie they had bean sprouts , lo mein with veggies , a veggie fried rice , fried bananas , butter potatoes , french fries and fresh doughnuts . <sssss> they also had a good amount of fish , some type of skin on roasted fish in a butter sauce , a fried fish and fried whole tilapia . <sssss> i was very happy to see a wide range of hot sauces to put on the food including siraca at the tables , chillie oil and chillie paste . <sssss> the booth are very 1986 looking and are well sunken in . <sssss> overall the value and quality here is good and none of us got sick afterwards so it passes that key test . <sssss> . <sssss> their last few heath ratings have been all silver , so give it a try ! 
4		ohhhh i love buca birthday song ! <sssss> i came here to celebrate my birthday and the song is the best !! <sssss> i should record it when everybody sang the song . 
4		start your lunch/dinner with their yia yia 's chocolate sheet cake -- it is very good ! <sssss> i prefer their sandwiches and orzo salad ! 
4		this place makes a mean grilled cheese with a great selection of cheeses . <sssss> the quality is great and every time i go to the phoenix public market on friday afternoons for lunch , its always a toss up between this place and short leash because both places are top notch . <sssss> my personal favorite of theirs is the veggie which has roasted red peppers , provolone , tomato , basil , arugula and balsamic all for $ 6 , which is not too bad considering the average market and cost of food truck food in phx . 
4		i 'm not a veteran , but i have many friends and relatives who are and i 'm impressed that this carl 's jr offers a 10 % discount for veterans . <sssss> kudos to you ! <sssss> http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/carls-jr-mesa-5?select=zxu23wtkwnzxihrqbwvl5q#_btgsnqbhylsmy1ncl058w the food here is average . <sssss> i stopped by for lunch and ordered a big carl -lrb- $ 4.49 -rrb- and a western bacon cheeseburger -lrb- $ 3.99 -rrb- . <sssss> http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/carls-jr-mesa-5?select=zxu23wtkwnzxihrqbwvl5q#m-r_udfhbb3crxab_pzpmw it 's tastier than most of these fast food burger joints , but it was n't as good as other carl 's jr locations i 've been to . <sssss> the food gets 3 stars and i 've bumped it up to 4 stars because of their veteran 's discount ... i think they deserve it for recognizing those who serve our country . <sssss> return factor - 70 % 
4		laid back , great beer , and a menu packed with variety for everyone . <sssss> we sat on the outside patio and enjoyed lunch . <sssss> i got the portabella veggie beer bread since i had no idea what to expect from the name alone ! <sssss> turns out , it is lots of veggies and lots -lrb- maybe too much -rrb- cheese rolled in a tasty beer bread wrap . <sssss> very good , and of course , the french fries were awesome too . <sssss> friendly service , even the chef came out to check on our table -lrb- he was yummy too ! -rrb- <sssss> this was the first time i had been to this location , since i 'm from tempe and usually frequent the original . <sssss> it was clean and had normal brewery decor , but it 's hard to beat the tempe location with the actual beer brewing gear and old charming character . <sssss> definitely check this place out if you 're in the area . 
4		i 'm never a fan of these brestaurants but this one makes up for it . <sssss> and yes , i am a chick . <sssss> for starts , the girls are wearing uniforms that actually fit them . <sssss> nothing is popping out and almost touching my food/beer . <sssss> second , the girls are actually clean looking - not sporting the greasy or ' i just got out of bed and look at my nappy hair ' look . <sssss> the service was excellent . <sssss> quick , accurate and friendly without . <sssss> . <sssss> weird friendly . <sssss> drink prices were fair even off happy hour and the nachos were great . <sssss> they actually layer the meat/cheese throughout which is so nice compared to most placed that just dump the flavor on top leaving you with nothing once you peel away the layer of 3 inch thick crap . <sssss> the rest of the food looked like regular bar food . <sssss> the patio is awesome , they even have a fire place and water / fish pond thing . <sssss> total chill place except for the weird-eye-balley-men here . <sssss> we watched a couple walk in and sit across from us at the bar -lrb- it 's like a square shape -rrb- . <sssss> the guy left to use the bathroom or something and this random eye-baller came up and proceeded to not only hit on the chick -lrb- who was not as hot as the waitresses -rrb- and proceeded to tell her how he was a dr. and blah blah . <sssss> needless to say when the guy returned they almost got in a cat fight . <sssss> sad part about it , mr. dr. was wearing holey old navy t-shirt ... that 's snottsdale for ya ... $ 30k millionaires all over the place . 
4		like everyone else says - good if you pay only $ 30 or $ 40 - in relatively good shape - it is a great little executive with nice staff and a nice clubhouse 
4		nice small sandwich shop . <sssss> nice owner , sandwiches and treats . <sssss> it is so nice to have a local place . 
4		i do n't come here often , but when i do it 's usually because i have a night planned at the filmbar -lrb- which usually also includes post-movie beverages at a neighboring bar -rrb- so what keeps me coming back is how strong their lattes are ! <sssss> i 'm an early-to-bed person normally so i have to prep myself when i decide to have a night out on a work night . <sssss> the only thing i 've had here are their iced mochas , those are always my drink of choice . <sssss> i like strong mochas with flavoring that still lets the espresso shine through and they do that well here , unlike some coffee places that overdo the flavoring and make the drinks too sugary . <sssss> the vibes here are great , very relaxed with a good view of the north side of downtown phoenix and there 's an art exhibit on the other side of the wall that you can check out post-drink . <sssss> if you 're in the neighborhood , try it out . <sssss> p.s. a + for creativity on the menu that is spelled out in scrabble tiles ! 
4		one of the best thai restaurants in chandler . <sssss> the lunch specials are a really good . <sssss> but , i have enjoyed everything i have ordered anytime i have eaten here . <sssss> the ambiance is nice too . <sssss> service can be a bit slow , but i typically do n't mind because the food is always good . 
4		my fiance and i tried mercbar for the first time last saturday . <sssss> loved the decor ! <sssss> the drinks were excellent . <sssss> great place ! <sssss> i did wish the music was a little more chill , but it was a saturday night . 
4		they serve beer -lrb- actually a full bar now -rrb- !!! <sssss> this time i got a crunchy carnitas taco and a blackened chicken taco , so good ! <sssss> the carnitas is very flavourful , tender and the blackened chicken has a little spice . <sssss> when we were leaving we saw a couples order ; carne asada and chorizo nachos , they looked phenomenal and they said they get them all the time !!! <sssss> ¡ happy hour ! <sssss> $ 2 mexican cervezas and $ 3.99 margaritas 3 pm - 7 pm monday through friday http://habaneros.mx/ 
4		they serve a really great tasting burger and fries , are usually very clean , and all of the people who work there are friendly . <sssss> they also have a nice outdoor eating area with tables and benches , great for good weather days . <sssss> i only docked 1 star because of the location of the restaurant . <sssss> they are in an enclosed parking lot on a very busy street corner , 83rd ave and bell rd , making it somewhat of an ordeal to enter and exit . <sssss> and , by ` enclosed parking lot ' i mean that you can only enter and exit it from 83rd ave and not from bell rd nor from the neighboring shopping plaza . <sssss> literally , you can only enter by driving north on 83rd ave. , and you must u-turn if coming from anywhere else . <sssss> sometimes the traffic is just horrendous , making it even worse . <sssss> i 've seen some people just park in the shopping plaza and jump the little wall to avoid these traffic issues . <sssss> anyway , the entrance/exit is a bit of a pain , but it 's worth it for a great burger every once in awhile . <sssss> if you 're a first-timer , be aware that they really have only 3 food items : a hamburger , a cheeseburger , and fries . <sssss> you can , of course , customize these items with the available toppings or get a double or triple burger , etc. . <sssss> they also have a not-so-secret , secret menu ... just google it if you 're interested . <sssss> for drinks , they have shakes and fountain sodas . <sssss> overall , 4 stars for yummy food , clean space , and great customer service ! 
4		i missed the memo that the burgers not designated as little are actually doubles . <sssss> so , i 've now eaten my first ever double cheeseburger . <sssss> good thing i was starving . <sssss> on a normal day , i 'll have to remember to get the `` little cheeseburger '' . <sssss> the cajun fries have a little bit of a kick ... nothing crazy , just a little flavor . <sssss> the thing that i was most entertained by was the super awesome digital coke fountain machine . <sssss> there must 've been at least 50 different flavors of coke products , many of which i 've never heard of like raspberry coke or orange coke . 
4		good place to grab wings and beer . <sssss> i went the opening day of man of steal . <sssss> it was crowded but not to bad . <sssss> it was fun being able to play the video poker game with more then just the poeple at my table . <sssss> the servers were nice and fast . <sssss> over all i like it . 
4		contrary to other reviews , the wait just seems long because of the cafeteria style ordering . <sssss> it goes by pretty quickly and we took the time to look through the extensive menu . <sssss> the sides all looked very appetizing and it was tough choosing which ones to try . <sssss> luckily , the portions were just right so you could get more than 1 and not be spultuffed . <sssss> i got the beans and potato salad which were both excellent . <sssss> my gf tried the mac and cheese and cheesy potatoes . <sssss> macn cheese was excellent , but the potatoes were just ok . <sssss> for main course , i figured i 'd try a taste sampler of all their meats in the form of sliders : pulled pork , turkey , and beef brisket . <sssss> the turkey was surprisingly moist and not dry . <sssss> pulled pork and beef were my favorites . <sssss> the bbq house sauce and spicy sauce were both excellent , i could n't get enough of them . <sssss> i also loved their fresh , house made sodas and root beer , lemonades . <sssss> i 'll have to save room for their delicious looking desserts next time . <sssss> the only thing better to go along with all the great meat would be some cold beer . 
4		the service and food was very good . <sssss> i had a pear chicken salad that was fresh and tasty . <sssss> my husband said his hamburger was good . 
4		a very large clean store with a great select of meats and produce . 
4		tables , chairs , linens , umbrellas , utensils , etc. . <sssss> . <sssss> these are things you rarely think about but when you go to large events , they do come from somewhere . <sssss> and these are things i 've had to think about recently when i 've planned larger scale events for the yelp community . <sssss> luckily , andrew 's rentals has been great for supplying the basics that i 've needed with wonderful customer service , decent prices , delivery , and more . <sssss> they 've made my life a lot easier - yes , i know i get stressed , but imagine if andrew 's rentals were not there to help ?! <sssss> anyways , i 've used andrews rentals for the high top tables and the plastic tablecloths at the heard museum event , and most recently , andrews rentals supplied the six foot tables and black linen table cloths that the vendors used at the yelp rocks ! <sssss> martini ranch event ... both times , they delivered as promised with no major problems ... if you 're in need of anything for a house party to a wedding or major corporate event , give evelyn at andrew 's rental a call ... she 's a doll and i guarantee from my experience that you 'll be in good hands . <sssss> party on ! 
4		good food and fast 
4		the biltmore macy 's is a great location for anyone who needs to get something quick and get out . <sssss> no worries of parking lots 2 miles away or busy hallways to fight thru . <sssss> it 's selection is not as great as the scottsdale macy 's and it is a little more cluttered and outdated . <sssss> overall , still the first place i would run to for housewares , furniture or clothes . 
4		i really love this place ! <sssss> a casual and comfortable atmosphere with awesome food and good priced wines ! <sssss> i love 5th and wine for happy hour during the week with girlfriends-try and sit in their `` living room '' setting and grab a few appetizers and a $ 5 glass of wine - i really love their riesling . <sssss> the french fries and bruschette 's are a great way to mix sweet -lrb- brie and apple bruschetta -rrb- and salty -lrb- garlic and parmesan fries -rrb- . <sssss> want to get crazy ? <sssss> try the julia child 's beef bourguignon , a saturday night specialty that is hearty and absolutely delicious ! 
4		update : new management = new way of life . <sssss> this starbucks has made great improvements . <sssss> i do n't go as much as i used to when i thought i had less time . <sssss> but i do go often enough to read or just pick up a coffee and i 've seen a great improvement in this store . <sssss> that 's great . <sssss> 2011 review i 'm giving them a 3 because i rarely get exactly what i want from the window . <sssss> but let me start with the good first . <sssss> friendliest bunch of folks i 've ever seen . <sssss> all people on the staff seem to love their jobs ! <sssss> they also seem to work very efficiently . <sssss> unfortunately , the attire is a little small . <sssss> ites not conducive to a small study group , even though it practically sits on a small college campus . <sssss> . <sssss> no couches or comfy chairs to sit and socialize . <sssss> my main reason for the 3 rating is the fact that i rarely get what i `` want '' from that drive up window ! <sssss> i used to order a tall coffee and a hot veggie sandwich . <sssss> the sandwich is almost always cold in the center , even if i ask them to heat it longer so the center is warm . <sssss> sometimes i ask for my coffee with two pumps of cream and i have to go in to get more cream . <sssss> i have stopped ordering the sandwiches as much , saves me money , that 's for sure . <sssss> i started making my own coffee at home , and soon , i 'll probably just stop by there as a treat once a week for the coffee , sans the sandwhich . 
4		i really only give the burgers in this joint 3 or 4 stars , but the other items on the menu , make this place amazing . <sssss> such as : # 1 tots . <sssss> # 2 ` breakfast bistro ' sandwich . <sssss> you ca n't get a better fast food breakfast sandwich . <sssss> a large , super-soft bun , egg , meat , and cheese . <sssss> once you have it , your mouth will water every day you drive by sonic in the morning . <sssss> # 3 quality commercials . <sssss> the guy who wanted the ` last word ' on his wife . <sssss> you want some fries with that shake ? <sssss> they 're all pretty funny . <sssss> # 4 coconut cream pie shake . <sssss> bits of pie in a shake . <sssss> good as hell . <sssss> # 5 happy hour . <sssss> stop by and get a large cherry-limeade or powerade slush for 80 cents . <sssss> you ca n't beat that . 
4		stumbled upon this place when we went to fabulous downtown chandler on a whim . <sssss> had some cool chill mood music playing that we heard from the sidewalk . <sssss> very cool place . <sssss> we sat on the back patio , which was great . <sssss> it kind of had a california vibe to it , with the ambience of `` tao '' in las vegas . <sssss> we like the exposed brick look outside . <sssss> our server matt , was very helpful . <sssss> a great place to hang out at although the night we went , it was slow . <sssss> the cucumber margarita was awesome . <sssss> went safe on the menu with the pepper steak . <sssss> it was straight forward with simple flavors and just enough heat . <sssss> they also had a private karaoke room . <sssss> will definitely will be going back with `` the gang '' . 
4		this is where i go to get my car washed . <sssss> they do a good job , it 's never a long wait and the prices are good . <sssss> the guys are always super nice to me . <sssss> every time i 've gone , i 've gotten some kind of random discount . <sssss> i agree with the other reviewers . <sssss> way better than danny 's . 
4		one of my favorite chinese food places . <sssss> the orange beef is a must try ! <sssss> if your in the area its worth stopping in for !! 
4		a hip restaurant in an old house downtown -lrb- next to cibo -rrb- . <sssss> the menu is somewhat snooty , but i 've been very pleased with the breakfast items i 've tried . <sssss> there is usually a wait , but there is lots of outdoor seating and tables to wait at . <sssss> the cranberry nut bread is delish . <sssss> they seem to be bike and dog friendly -lrb- outside only of course -rrb- . <sssss> the service is ok and they really should figure out how to not keep people waiting when they have open tables , but overall this is great place . <sssss> they have a website , so you can check out their menu before you go . 
4		i enjoy hanging with my friends here , for dinner or a drink , very nice staff and i also enjoy the atmosphere . 
4		such unique , gourmet style sandwiches . <sssss> i had the prosciutto , fig jam , and gorgonzola sandwich which was perfect . <sssss> and i do n't even like coleslaw in general but this one with blue cheese was amazing . <sssss> definitely coming back to try more ! 
4		i was pleasantly surprised that food was hot and delish each time . <sssss> i enjoy the combo rice minus pork , kung pao chicken and shrimp and the orange chicken made spicy . <sssss> my company also said the beef and broccoli was very delish . <sssss> i don `` t live that far away yet delivery really takes the 35-40min wait they say ... i like to think this has a lot to do with the hot fresh made when you order factor : -rrb- 
4		great flight to oc ... quick and quiet , the way it should be : -rrb- 
4		after work on friday , i found out i had a very flat tire . <sssss> an unfortunate thing because nobody likes to spend money on tires and i definitely did n't want to spend my evening waiting on a repair . <sssss> we made it to this discount tire at 6:00 pm ... just in time for the doors to be closing . <sssss> i thought i was out of luck , but steven came out and helped us anyway . <sssss> he was super friendly and provided us with knowledgeable , professional service when he could have easily turned us away . <sssss> i am very impressed with the customer service at this location . <sssss> we had a beer next door while we waited , and 30 minutes later we drove away with a brand new tire . <sssss> the price was reasonable and though it was n't my favorite way to spend a friday night , i left a satisfied customer . <sssss> thanks , steven ! 
4		what a fun shop ! <sssss> i love me a good antique store and was reasonably impressed with the collection of vintage/furniture/salvage / and antiques offered . <sssss> pricing was varied based on dealer booth -lrb- as is typical with nearly any antique store you visit -rrb- the staff was very friendly and eager to help as needed . <sssss> inside , the store is well layed out , large enough to explore , but cozy enough so you do n't get eye fatigue . <sssss> any antique fan looking for some treasure would enjoy a stop in . 
4		food is very good . <sssss> atmosphere is okay . <sssss> staff is tops ! 
4		good location , always busy , decent parking , and food is 100 time better than the hooters that is literally across the street . <sssss> the food is always good . <sssss> warning to the pregnant ladies : some of the wing sauces that may not bother you before you were pregnant , will set off the morning sickness just by smell alone . <sssss> use caution !!! 
4		we recently got married at the secret garden . <sssss> it 's hard to give a review of a place that holds so much weight , but i 'll do my best to be non-biased . <sssss> we had about 4 months to plan our wedding , and so we picked our venue very quickly . <sssss> that 's not to say that we would have reconsidered ; the secret garden is beautiful , their prices are reasonable , and they allow for more flexibility than many venues . <sssss> we opted for a package to choose and pay our own vendors , as we wanted to include some friends and more personal options than those listed in the all-inclusive package . <sssss> interviewing vendors was a bit of a stressful task , but we got through it and were lad to have made the effort because everyone did a great job and each individual part was exactly what we wanted . <sssss> now , as for the venue itself , there are some big plusses and a few drawbacks . <sssss> dave and nancy own the place . <sssss> overall they do a great job . <sssss> as a participant in a family business , i like to see the owners doing the work at the property . <sssss> they have great pride in a beautiful location , and it is totally understandable that they have a few rules to protect their property -lrb- no confetti/glitter , extra safety precautions , etc -rrb- they have an event coordinator , alexis , who was very helpful in getting everything planned for us in the formative stages . <sssss> she and i emailed dozens of times and met twice for long sit-downs and to plan out arrangements in the hall and the ceremony grounds . <sssss> on our last meeting , she informed me she would n't be the attendant at the wedding , but nancy would be there . <sssss> i was initially uncomfortable with having spent my time planning only to be switched off to someone else , and i got a good deal of resistance for my complaints . <sssss> all in all , nancy did a good job with us . <sssss> the rehearsal was a bit rocky , but i would wager almost every rehearsal feels that way . <sssss> the wedding itself turned out pretty darn good ; it rained like crazy and we had to switch the plan and do the whole thing inside , but nancy was a great help and got through a last-minute organizational would-be disaster . <sssss> though we did n't have the beautiful ceremony we had imagined , it still turned out great and we would n't change it if we had the chance . <sssss> i gave four stars because i would recommend the secret garden to couples looking for a venue with only a bit of caution . <sssss> it was seemingly cost-prohibitive for many , but the versatile packages made it more accessible and personalized . <sssss> the staff was friendly , a bit fussy and for the most part effective to my satisfaction . <sssss> i 'd say go for it , but just remind yourself that sometimes it rains , so be mindful especially in monsoon season ! <sssss> p.s. if you can help it , pick virtually anywhere other than the house -lrb- the restaurant that adjoins the venue -rrb- for your rehearsal dinner . <sssss> overpriced , underwhelming food and staff that were unhelpful to the point of near-confrontation . <sssss> totally not worth it for a milestone celebration . 
4		definitely leans more toward the korean flavors than japanese . <sssss> the food was very good and the provided a lot of it ! <sssss> it is a very popular place and can get a bit crowded , but most of the folks there were regulars and all having a good time . <sssss> the service was also very good . <sssss> more like a family serving you than professional waiters . <sssss> very nice from a neighborhood restaurant . <sssss> i will be back ! 
4		i have to admit i love to take my daughteer to jamba juice about once a week these days ?? <sssss> why you ask with shock would i go to a chain ?? <sssss> because : a. they have a really big helping of fruit in there , have you seen the blender full of berries ? <sssss> b. it 's fun ! <sssss> c. they have great service and it 's in a great location d. they honor old expired coupons e. my daughter likes it and will enjoy fruit f. non fat -lrb- we do n't get the fat laden penaut butter ones -rrb- g. i can add vitamins or boosts -lrb- emember the ole snl skit ... no boost ! -rrb- <sssss> h. it 's fast i. taste good and does n't weigh me down do n't judge me ... i am going to do it even if it 's a chain ... 
4		if you 're into craft or international beers , they stock a ton of them . <sssss> the line at the deli counter is no joke - take a number right away and you may have to wait awhile . <sssss> this is a nice spot to grab lunch and sit outside on their big patio with the free wifi . <sssss> lots of yoga pants here . <sssss> i 'd like to meet the people who stack the fruit perfectly in their produce section . <sssss> i 'll bet they 're amazing at jenga . 
4		i always visit this place every time i 'm back home from school . <sssss> the food is very tasty and the restaurant is clean . <sssss> i usually order shredded beef tacos or the shredded beef chimichanga , and i am usually always very pleased . <sssss> the only slight con about this place is that their prices are quite a bit higher than more mexican restaurants that are a bit more authentic . 
4		really like this amc . <sssss> very large , good at accomodating for schools and field trips , and never really busy like every single mall theatre for opening nights and midnight releases . <sssss> would highly recommend . <sssss> i think they validate for parking as well , which rocks . 
4		yum . 
4		three words : best mocha ever . <sssss> oh , and five more words : best peanut butter brownie ever . <sssss> now that we know i like lux , let 's talk about some peoples complaints . <sssss> those who know me know i 'm not trendy or a `` hipster '' , but i 've never had anyone at lux `` scoff '' at my target clothes or un-trendy shoes . <sssss> and for the most part , everyone i know who goes to lux really does work while they 're there ... they are n't just pretending to be on their computer ! <sssss> and if they are n't working , it 's probably because the internet is down -lrb- which happens a lot more than it should at lux -rrb- . <sssss> overall , i really like this place but i can see how one who is n't super trendy or artsy might be intimidated when they first show up . <sssss> my advice is to go again , a lot of different types of people go there and are really friendly . <sssss> plus , the different groups of people will come in cycles ... at a certain time it might be inundated with twenty-something hippies with dreads , and another time it might be taken over by 30-something slightly overweight workaholics . <sssss> do n't let people scare you from a good place . 
4		stopped if for supplies and found everything i was looking for so i vote yes to going back . 
4		`` the water here is amazing '' ahaha . <sssss> . <sssss> i came here a few weeks ago and one of the guys that we were with was going on how the water here is so great and its the same water they use in the beer . <sssss> so any time we asked our sever for water we would say , we have heard good things about it . <sssss> anyway this place is legit . <sssss> we got a table out side and chilled drinking beer and enjoying the scenery . <sssss> the hop knot was on point and the other beers were great as well . <sssss> the food was tasty but nothing spectacular . <sssss> i would definitely recommend this place to anyone that wants to escape the major chain restaurants in the area . <sssss> -lrb- yeah i know four peaks has two locations but it does n't have that over processed feel like chilies or gordon biersch 
4		i normally avoid chain restaruants . <sssss> i 'm just not a fan . <sssss> but chipotle is good and gmo concious . 
4		i used to joke about this place because of past experiences with restaurants that do many different asian dishes at once . <sssss> usually they 're so terrible with food that it 'll knock you on your back faster than a kick to the face . <sssss> tott 's proved me wrong . <sssss> so wrong that i came back the day after i ate there . <sssss> everything i 've had has been really good , but i have an addiction to their orange shrimp . <sssss> the perfect level of spice , the crunchy golden shrimp , and that godly sauce ... sorry . <sssss> i need to clean up my keyboard now . <sssss> the walnut shrimp was really good , the bourbon chicken was nice , the stir fry is good , and the lo mein was excellent . <sssss> wait . <sssss> all this praise and it 's only getting 4 out of 5 ? <sssss> okay , their fried rice is n't all that great -lrb- tastes pretty flat -rrb- and the won ton soup has some pretty weak won tons . <sssss> the portions are huge though and it compensates for the flat rice . <sssss> if their fried rice was as good as any other chinese place , i 'll happily edit this and give them five stars . <sssss> the owner is really nice though and is always thankful for your business ... so my final score is a 4 1/2 out of 5 . 
4		ok . <sssss> first off , one star for having an odd sign out front that says , `` like all good speak easys , the entrance is in the rear . '' <sssss> another star for comfy couches and couples making out in front of us . <sssss> . <sssss> ahhaha ok sexing it up on the couches in front of us . <sssss> another star for meeting some guy in the bathroom line with the same rolex as me . <sssss> . <sssss> and hitting it off . <sssss> . <sssss> until he came to find me in the bar . <sssss> and brought his girlfriend to chat too !?! <sssss> crazy odd . <sssss> and the last star for a ton of wine selections in one of the darkest places i have ever , ever been . 
4		i am having a hard time finding amazing mexican food in arizona . <sssss> . <sssss> but valle luna has some tasty bean dip to go along with those thin chips . <sssss> first impressions make or break with me . <sssss> . <sssss> so that definitely helped ! <sssss> i have tried multiple things here and each time i am happy with my decision ! <sssss> mmm and mango margaritas are sooo good ! 
4		i am definitely a fan of their subs , they have always been fresh and tasty . <sssss> i do have one complaint on the `` chicken caesar salad '' which i had ordered awhile back . <sssss> to be honest it was a pathetic excuse for a caesar salad . <sssss> first of all my chicken was heated in the microwave which was a little unappealing and the texture was a little off . <sssss> second , there was no croutons , no parmesan , and the lettuce was a shredded iceberg/romaine mix . <sssss> to top it all the dressing was n't a creamy caesar dressing so i was 100 % disappointed with this salad . <sssss> i would have named it the plain microwaved chicken salad . 
4		i would give this place 4.5 stars if i could . <sssss> the vibe at this place is cool , it is hipster . <sssss> we went on a tuesdaay and it was packed . <sssss> we sat at the bar and ordered the following : chicken wings in thai chile sauce - fried then grilled - blue cheese was very good - overall delicious ! <sssss> rib basket with skinny french fries - excellent flavor and crispy flies banana nut bread pudding with carmel sauce and vanilla ice cream - omg great bar food and the drinks were interesting as well . <sssss> suit and tie - oatmeal stout beer/grey goose cherry vodka , soda water and something else . <sssss> it was inventive and good . <sssss> it was n't too sweet i had `` the loop '' sauvignon blanc - actually the best sb i have ever had - very cirtrusy and cold . <sssss> service was good , although not overly friendly . <sssss> definitely worth going back to ... 
4		as others have said , it 's probably the closest thing to bay area shopping in the valley . <sssss> that being said , its not really like the ferry building or the fourth street shops in berkeley , but it is a good collection of local businesses with interesting items that you 're unlikely to find elsewhere . <sssss> from olive oil to bicycles , travel accessories to vintage sunglasses , men 's and women 's clothing or even classic candies , this is place to go if you want something different and unique . <sssss> i just wonder how long it will last because rent in the biltmore ca n't be cheap and even with the inflated prices , these stores are going to need to do a lot of business and so far when i 've been they appear to be filled with people browsing , not buying . 
4		it turns out , i 'd heard of taste of tops months ago , but i had assumed that my friend was referring to his own mixed selection from tops liquor store . <sssss> this friend has a nickname for everything -- he calls his tupperware `` tuppies '' , he calls single cigarettes `` loosies '' . <sssss> i should have known that taste of tops was not a creation from his imagination when it did n't end in '' - ies '' . <sssss> alas , i was a fool , but i love their eclectic and rotating tap selection as well as their bottles and their strange exhaust system that occasionally billows in pizza aromas from the place next door . <sssss> another treasure in the stripmall matrix that is metrophoenix . 
4		food is great , but the service can be slow when they are busy . <sssss> one of the better bbq places in the valley that we frequent when craving bbq . <sssss> i get the two meats with brisket and pulled pork and my wife gets either the tacos with the same meats or the quesadilla . <sssss> overall , we are fans . 
4		- fantastic fresh dim sum ! <sssss> -lrb- even during weekday lunch -rrb- - decent prices ... - nice decor - typical fancy chinese restaurant decor . <sssss> - clean restroom . <sssss> - service - friendly , esp for a chinese restaurant . <sssss> although , the chinese cashier guy did n't seem very friendly , the food servers and ladies pushing the dim sum carts were friendly and attentive . <sssss> - most of the customers were asian , which is a good sign of food authenticity ... ya know you made a good choice ! <sssss> - ordered turnip cakes and chinese broccoli off the menu , since they were n't on any of the carts . <sssss> - very convenient parking ... plenty of spots . <sssss> - the food is so good , it 's worth the msg headache ! 
4		ok i have been on a burger hunt for a while . <sssss> have tried smash burger twice and found it pretty good , the sweet potato fries moved them from three to four stars . <sssss> they get extra points for staying open late during movie premier events . 
4		what a great restaurant ! <sssss> it has lots of conversational pieces on the walls without being really tacky . <sssss> the building has a ton of history and it 's really interesting . <sssss> the waitresses are always super sweet . <sssss> i 've never had one that was n't funny and nice and very attentive . <sssss> my family comes here for breakfast , lunch , and dinner . <sssss> it 's rare that a restaurant has great food in all three categories . <sssss> the only problem i have is that every single time i ask for something without cheese ... it comes with cheese anyways . <sssss> i 'm not one for sending food back so then i 'm forced to take medicine and bear a stomachache . <sssss> bill johnsons just really wants me to endure dairy i guess . 
4		i would have given postino 's -lrb- as we lovingly call it -rrb- 5 stars if it were n't for the ridiculously long wait , but ! <sssss> it was a friday night . <sssss> i ca n't complain about lingering in la grande orange while waiting for our table . <sssss> i was in a party of 3 , probably took us an hour to get a table as we chose not to sit at the bar , ended up with cozy seating outside on the patio , where the tables seem perfectly spaced from each other , and the twinkly lights seemed almost magical . <sssss> we ordered glasses of wine , then settled on a bottle of tempranillo -lrb- wow ! -rrb- <sssss> to accompany our respective bruschetta boards . <sssss> adored the mascarpone-fig-proscuitto -lrb- first experience with that combo -rrb- and spicy white bean hummus . <sssss> i liked the fresh mozzarella-tomato-basil just okay , thought the hearty chewiness of the bread was a bit much for the delicate toppings . <sssss> try to walk if you can - parking is a nightmare . <sssss> love it ! 
4		vibe : perhaps the ultimate see and be seen spot in scottsdale . <sssss> located in the newly updated mondrian in scottsdale . <sssss> the restaurant is all white and the employees are also in white . <sssss> hostesses sport white halter dresses as well . <sssss> somehow all-white in the desert does n't come off as sexy as intended . <sssss> the lighting is a tad on the bright side of the restaurant . <sssss> on one wall of the restaurant is a huge photo-art of a rooster . <sssss> the effect is kitchy , witty , and outrageous at the same time . <sssss> the banquettes and booths are set low so everyone is able to check each other out . <sssss> food : as it was explained to us , the food was cuban/latin with asian flavors and prepared with asian techniques . <sssss> 5 of us shared 2 appetizers , 3 main dishes , 2 sides , and 1 huge dessert . <sssss> we started with the lobster potstickers and chicken skewers . <sssss> the lobster potstickers were okay ... for a $ 26 appetizer i expected the foodie angels to sing . <sssss> -lrb- fyi , truly great lobster potstickers can be had at roy 's -rrb- . <sssss> the chicken was tender and flavorful and also thoroughly enjoyed the peanut sauce . <sssss> for the mains , we had crispy tofu , salmon , and roast pork . <sssss> the portions are quite generous -lrb- although if you 're paying $ 34 for pork and $ 24 for tofu , it better be -rrb- . <sssss> the pork was very fatty because it came from the pork belly and there was very little meat attached to the fat . <sssss> the meat was very tender flavorful , but this cut should be specified in the menu as most us diners are accustomed to pork loin . <sssss> we were celebrating miss c 's birthday a little early and ordered the `` bay of pigs '' banana split sundae to share . <sssss> it was huge and a lot of messy fun to eat together . <sssss> drink : the cocktails were $ 14 each -lrb- $ 2 more than the adjacent skybar -rrb- so we shared a bottle of sake . <sssss> the tiniest bottle of sake -lrb- 375 ml -rrb- was $ 45 ! <sssss> we each got a thimble-full and savored each drop . <sssss> service : considering it 's a brand new operation , the service was good , although not seamless . <sssss> we had to remind the waitstaff for water , etc. . <sssss> also , they did not wipe down or clean the table between courses and by the end of the meal , the table was decorated with random sauce splotches and crumbs . <sssss> for the prices they charge , i would also suggest changing the cutlery between courses . <sssss> verdict : unapologetically pretentious . <sssss> but good fun . <sssss> would definitely go once , but probably not twice . 
4		nice little wine bar . <sssss> i enjoyed a flight of whites and one of their specialty salads for lunch . <sssss> pretty tasty . <sssss> the food wo n't win any culinary rewards , but it is good and the ingredients seem fresh . <sssss> minor niggle , they only seem to have high-top seating ... when all i want to do is curl up in a booth and drink myself silly , this can be a problem . 
4		`` wan na date ? '' <sssss> yes , this is what the young kid asks every gal who walks by , but what he 's offering is n't some one-night stand , it 's a fantastic organic medjool date . <sssss> this is a very short note to say you should buy from him and eat a few a day and you will be happy . <sssss> and it 's easier than fighting with the birds in your own date palm to harvest them . <sssss> yes , truly , your date palm is n't just shedding schmutz , those dates up there are edible ... but i willed mine this year to the birds and bought from these guys . <sssss> sonoran date palms hc-1 box 35w dateland , az 85333 928-454-2771 shephardneeley@yahoo.com 
4		pp is consistently rated an `` easy '' hike and i really do n't know why , maybe because it 's not very long . <sssss> i 've hiked pretty much all the `` moderate '' mountains and a few `` difficult '' ones and i think pinnacle peak is at least moderate . <sssss> it is not easy . <sssss> as others mention , it 's important for a variety of reasons to realize this is not a loop , or `` up and down '' trail . <sssss> you go up , down , up , down , up down , -lrb- you get the idea -rrb- . <sssss> in face , the most challenging part is the first `` up '' after the last `` down '' -lrb- aka , the midpoint -rrb- . <sssss> the `` way back '' is more challenging than the way out , particularly that first 1/4 mile which is up . <sssss> so just pace yourself and be prepared for the way back to take a little longer than the way out . <sssss> a steady walking hike takes about an hour and fifteen . <sssss> i have friends who run it in 45 . <sssss> if you 're not a hiker , just prepare for closer to 2 hours and take breaks . <sssss> in any case , it 's a nice hike . <sssss> no shade , though , so prepare for that too . 
4		this is a great funky hold-in-the-wall cafe . <sssss> it is a little hard to find , but worth the journey . <sssss> i had a yummy tea , and my friend had a tea with granola . <sssss> i have to take away one star because both of our tea cups somehow leaked . <sssss> weird , huh ? <sssss> anyway , i very much look forward to giving this place another chance . 
4		i was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant . <sssss> geisha sushi was moderately priced and we totally liked their food . <sssss> ambience was rocker meets japan , non-pretentious and the service was great . 
4		first , let me say that this review is only for happy hour from 3pm to 7pm . <sssss> second , let me tell you that i 've been going here for years . <sssss> the happy hour drink specials are nothing special -lrb- get it ? -rrb- <sssss> the margaritas vary in alcohol content depending on some cosmic sign from the universe . <sssss> apparently , when the moon is in retrograde , they are eyewateringly strong . <sssss> however , when gemini is on the cusp -lrb- or something -rrb- then they taste like they have nothing in them . <sssss> on the other hand , the saki bombers are a pretty good deal . <sssss> so , you ask , why give it 4 stars and keep going ? <sssss> the food ! <sssss> the happy hour menu has half off of individual pizzas , several different sushi rolls , fish or chicken tacos , calamari , and more . <sssss> in general , 6 of us go at a time . <sssss> we eat until at we are all stuffed , and drink until at least three of us are blowing about 0.06 -- or more . <sssss> and the bill including tax and a 20 % tip , never goes above $ 140.00 . <sssss> special recommendations : the calamari , spicy tuna rolls , california rolls -lrb- ask for no mayo on them -rrb- , and the fish tacos . <sssss> if you are a serious avocado fan , they have an avocado eggroll , but i am seriously warning you , there are 4 halves on the plate and you absolutely will not be able to eat all 4 . <sssss> they are just too rich . <sssss> i want to go now , but happy hour does n't start until 3 . <sssss> let me mention a few other things that i like about it , but that might turn you off -- or on , you never know . <sssss> the hh specials are only available on the patio or in the bar . <sssss> the patio overlooks the valet parking . <sssss> this , in particular , is one of my favorite things . <sssss> i once saw a guy completely dressed in red from head to foot -- seriously , red cap to red shoes , get out of a red rolls royce with burberry headrests and red leather upholstery . <sssss> i 'm still laughing . <sssss> i also get to see great classics , awesome ferraris , etc. ... oh , and the bathroom is pretty far away downstairs . <sssss> i actually like this since i get to walk through the entire restaurant and people-watch . 
4		this place is original mexican . <sssss> i had 3 carne asada tacos and they were super tasty . <sssss> all of their salsas are good too . <sssss> decent place . 
4		here 's what we tried . <sssss> - albacore - i really liked it , hubby says it was `` great '' - butterfish : me - okay , hubby `` great '' - ****** borretta-both thought it was so delish !!! <sssss> ****** - risotto squid ink - me - blah , hubby - `` okay '' . <sssss> he proceeded to spill the ink sauce on his nice white button up shirt , the server got him some soda water , and amazingly it did n't stain ! <sssss> crazy . <sssss> - gnocchi - me - blah , hubby - `` okay '' - pork belly - me - blah , hubby - `` okay '' - drink penicillin : hubby - `` too sweet '' , i just do n't like whiskey . <sssss> :-rrb- overall , we thought it was fun and unique and fancy . <sssss> not a place i 'd come regularly but a place i 'd take out of town guests . <sssss> the servers were great . <sssss> it 's a but dark in there so bring a little light if you are going with older folks : -rrb- 
4		my husband and i are considering moving to gilbert , so we were out scouting the area and decided to refer to yelp for breakfast . <sssss> while the line at farmhouse -lrb- next door -rrb- was out the door and i was tempted to try it , the reviewers of liberty market did me no wrong . <sssss> i had the western scramble and it was the perfect portions with a punch of flavor . <sssss> breakfast potatos = more please -lrb- i have a thing for potatos -rrb- . <sssss> i also had a sticky bun , which was huge but the sticky frosting was moist and tasty . <sssss> between the 2 of us , we could n't finish the 1 sticky bun , as much as we wanted to . <sssss> the people here were all really friendly , from the counter and wait staff to the very diners enjoying their breakfasts . <sssss> if i move to gilbert , i could see myself here every weekend . 
4		chips were great , enchiladas were great , and the ladies loved the margaritas ! <sssss> it 's got a fun atmosphere and excellent service , will definitely go again ! <sssss> it is a little hard to find tucked behind the hilton and some apartments . 
4		after a busy morning and playdate at imagination avenue , my friend jane b and our two almost two year olds had worked up quite an appetite ... we wanted a quick lunch before their naptime , so logically , we checked yelp for nearby lunch spots . <sssss> we did n't have to look far as 32 shea is literally right across the parking lot ... we decided to check it out and we were both very impressed . <sssss> 32 shea is a tiny little gem of a restaurant on the corner of -lrb- you guessed it -rrb- 32nd street and shea . <sssss> it 's colorful on the outside and inside both literally and figuratively ... the staff could n't have been friendlier - and that 's even with 2 toddler boys making a mess as jane and i tried to order and scarf our food down . <sssss> we each had `` the chop '' salad and shared two muffins with the boys . <sssss> the salads were fresh and a good portion size , and the muffins were delicious ... -lrb- we had a carrot muffin and a raspberry muffin -rrb- . <sssss> they actually tasted more like cupcakes , so i do n't know how healthy they were , but i 'll tell myself they were healthy ;-rrb- the menu has plenty more to choose from as well : all kinds of coffee drinks , smoothies , breakfast including egg sandwiches , burritos and oatmeal -lrb- served until noon -rrb- , lunch and even dinner ! <sssss> it sounds like at night the place becomes more loungey with candle light and table service -lrb- as opposed to the order at the counter style they have during the day -rrb- . <sssss> i 'll have to check that out ! <sssss> 32 shea reminded both of us of the type of cafe you 'd find in a more urban environment like nyc or perhaps even europe . <sssss> the building used to be a drive-thru photo mat and was then transformed to another restaurant before the current owners took it over in 2011 . <sssss> they 've done a fabulous job with it , and it still has a working drive-thru and a nice patio too . <sssss> i have one request of the owners : please get some lemonade on the menu ! <sssss> i wanted an arnold palmer but was told you do n't have lemonade , so that is something i 'd suggest . <sssss> other than that , it looks like you 've got something for everyone and i ca n't wait to return to try more from the menu ! 
4		popped in a for a bagel breakfast sandwich -- had it on the `` everything '' bagel aka the best bagel type ever . <sssss> it was good , filling . <sssss> back east bagels is a simple little coffee/breakfast/lunch spot . <sssss> nothing over the top , there is no need for it . <sssss> looks like they have a variety of sandwiches etc. . <sssss> they had this little `` treat '' on the counter that was 2 homemade sugar cookies with homemade cream cheese between the two cookies . <sssss> it sounded sooo good . <sssss> i did n't buy on but i wanted to , just to have a taste of it . <sssss> i behaved . <sssss> i 'm not in this part of town very often , maybe once or twice a year . <sssss> but i am glad i stopped in for my bagel sandwich this morning ! 
4		not bad at all . <sssss> a long time ago while there , the maricopa county restaurant inspector was there and he had been talking to the employees , then before i knew it he told the employees to close the restaurant immediately and to refund money paid for orders not yet filled and to not serve any more food . <sssss> since that time , and after viewing the updated inspection reports , i have returned to eat here many times . <sssss> the food is very good , and i 've not gotten sick there . <sssss> they are n't the friendliest there , but that 's probably partially due to the great location and not having to worry about customer retention since it 's the only place of that food genre in that high traffic area . <sssss> another place near there , at loop 101 , on 27th ave , has a very friendly proprietor , and he comes out to see how things are and such . <sssss> they get a lot of business , but perhaps not as much because their location is a bit obscure . <sssss> back to greek patio , the man that works there reminds me of the soup guy in seinfeld . <sssss> he does n't smile , does n't say thank you after you pay , and is quite stoic . <sssss> i think if you tried asking for a substitution , he may say `` no pita for you ! '' <sssss> like i said , since returning it 's been very good . <sssss> one less star due to the previous issues with health inspections . <sssss> but seems they 've resolved those . 
4		soooo much better than starbucks ! <sssss> the menu is relatively small which makes it much more pleasurable to place an order since it 's not as overwhelming . <sssss> we tried both the iced vanilla latte and the iced agave latte . <sssss> both were excellent with a wonderful coffee flavor that went well with the slight sweetness of both the vanilla and the agave . <sssss> i ca n't drink lattes at starbucks , they 're always way too sweet but i sure can at cartel ! <sssss> fun , funky environment and really nice employees . 
4		in chicago , we have binny 's - but bevmo 's has deals like getting a second bottle for like $ 5 ! <sssss> they also have this coyote gold frozen margarita in the form of a popsicle stick ! <sssss> talk about the perfect kid-like treat for adults . <sssss> i actually need to contact my friend about buying them and shipping them to me . <sssss> the cashier was friendly and helpful , and we certainly appreciated her recommendation and help to make sure we got our discount . 
4		my first time here was a great experience and i am looking forward to going back to try a plain thin crust pizza . <sssss> i tried the thin crust with italian beef and fresh tomato and it was very good . <sssss> however to me the test of a really great pizza is to have it with just cheese and sauce . <sssss> i also plan to ask if they will cut it ny style ! <sssss> i just like the triangle slices !! 
4		my love for sandwiches is no secret . <sssss> subway is my `` go to '' spot for lunch . <sssss> my usual order is : footlong bmt w/italian cheese bread , toasted , provolone , mustard , mayo , lettuce , tomato , onion , green peppers , pepperoncini , salt , pepper , oregano , oil , vinegar ... $ 6.00 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/evnkghd1h5vfypqt9qjohq?select=swrkkmdi5wzgvszmcopmoq#swrkkmdi5wzgvszmcopmoq http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/evnkghd1h5vfypqt9qjohq?select=_cec-skt7jr8nsraheo46q#_cec-skt7jr8nsraheo46q http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/evnkghd1h5vfypqt9qjohq?select=gh77-m4aa5u2fqo8j-_4ja#gh77-m4aa5u2fqo8j-_4ja the sandwich artists here are always good and get the order right . <sssss> i have n't had a bad sandwich yet . <sssss> return factor - 80 % 
4		quit whining about there being a bunch of pretty people at the gym . <sssss> if it bothers you that much , go to a different gym ! <sssss> i work out here several times a week and am not bothered by all the `` meat heads '' . <sssss> it 's a gym ! <sssss> i come to sweat my ass off and go home . <sssss> the staff is helpful and attentive . <sssss> there are normally plenty of machines available ... unless you come at 6pm after the new year - same with any gym . <sssss> the facility is overall pretty clean . <sssss> it 's a great gym to call home ! 
4		ok , i have to be honest . <sssss> i wanted to give this place 3 stars . <sssss> it 's a nice enough stadium to see a ballgame - but it 's pretty cavernous . <sssss> the stairs are really steep in the upper deck - and for a relatively new ballpark , it has a lot of nosebleeds . <sssss> the inside is clean enough , but i got the distinct feeling i was in a mall . <sssss> there is n't a lot of signage to direct you to your seat if you go inside in the wrong area . <sssss> permanent-looking beer stands that do n't take credit cards , and do n't have a sign saying so until you try and pay . <sssss> also , the surrounding neighborhood is surprisingly bland and boring , with little post game imbibing possible . <sssss> whatever . <sssss> i went august 7th - driving from san diego to phoenix on a whim . <sssss> got to the box office just as the game was starting , only to find out that the game was sold out , and the only tickets left were $ 130 seats . <sssss> eek ! <sssss> so as my boyfriend and i were standing there trying to figure out what to do , and all seemed lost , the ticket takers called us over and gave us tickets that some dude had dropped off . <sssss> that 's what earns this place a 4th star . <sssss> my padres lost , but i had a blast ! 
4		always consistent quality and value . <sssss> we have been regulars of pappadeaux in our previous home of tx , and we still are big fans ! 
4		great selection of frames but primarily designer ones . <sssss> versace , gucci , armani etc. . <sssss> this meant there are no economical options and that was the bad part . <sssss> i did n't get an eye check up here just went to buy my prescription glasses , appreciated their friendly service . <sssss> brad helped me find what i needed , very polite and patient with all the time i took ! <sssss> certainly reccomend this optical store . 
4		i do love their thin crust pizzas !!!! 
4		i have been to china chili a half dozen times mostly for lunch with co-workers . <sssss> their food is consistenly good . <sssss> wait staff are not very friendly but make up for it with sheer efficiency and quickness in taking your order and bringing your food . <sssss> we have never had to wait more than 5 minutes to be seated without a reservation during crowded lunch times . <sssss> the restaurant decor is spacious and inviting reflective of chinese art/culture ; two of my favorite dishes include : the orange chicken : generous breastmeat not overly breaded with the right amount of heat . <sssss> delicious . <sssss> spicy green beans with tofu is another excellent dish with green beans not over-cooked and flavorful braised tofu that absobs the garlicky sauce . <sssss> i am not a huge fan of chinese food , prefering instead thai , vietnamese and japanese cuisine which , for me , has more interesting ingredients . <sssss> but cc rates far above the other chinese restaurants i have tried . <sssss> . 
4		i 'm always looking for a new spot for lunch and i pass this place nearly every day on my way to work so i thought `` why not ? '' <sssss> upon entering the restaurant i was immediately greeted by a hostess . <sssss> i chose to sit at the bar since i was dinning alone . <sssss> the restaurant is very clean , modern and inviting - honestly it was much nicer than what i was expecting . <sssss> i love places that pay attention to detail -lrb- the ceiling had very ornate molded tiles ! -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> initially , i ordered the `` medium '' italian chopped salad as my lunch entrée but the server alerted me that the portions were very huge since they were meant to be shared so instead i got the `` small '' portion for $ 6.95 . <sssss> let me tell you the `` small '' was more than enough for me ! <sssss> the salad itself was well dressed and perfectly balanced , i enjoyed every bite -lrb- i wish i had a breadstick to compliment it ! -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> i ca n't wait to go back to try their pizzas and pastas . <sssss> the service was a little slow , but you can expect a quality meal . 
4		note : this is a review based on food , i do n't drink wine ! <sssss> i 've been here twice and thought the food was great both times ! <sssss> the bruschetta is a must and enjoyed the first four listed on the menu . <sssss> i cant recall what they are but i 'm always happy with them . <sssss> the place is a bit noisy and pricey . <sssss> to avoid the noise , i suggest sitting outside because it is well shades , and you can actually talk to and hear what your friends have to say . <sssss> also the inside is a bit crowded for me . <sssss> my finance and i kinda stick out like a sore thumb as this place because it predominately caters to older middle-aged caucasians , and we are quite the opposite demographic , but i wont hold this detail against them . <sssss> the reason i remove a star is because the cost is a bit hefty . <sssss> if you come here for wine during happy hour , its a great deal , but not so much for the food , hence my initial warning that this post will only be about the food . 
4		this is another of those places where while the building doest stand out -lrb- because its an end cap of an asian market -rrb- the food really does . <sssss> this is a goto for thai food for me cause the yellow curry is top of the line , and the crab puffs get me drooling . <sssss> to quote ferris , if you have the means -lrb- and you do -rrb- i highly recommend it . 
4		not what i was expecting from an italian restaurant in terms of decor and ambiance but overall a good experience . <sssss> we were the only ones in the restaurant other than a couple guys at the bar . <sssss> a group of us went for a late dinner and happened to go on the half-off wine bottle night . <sssss> good service at the table and extremely responsive . <sssss> we started off dinner with the stuffed mushrooms -lrb- they were excellent ! -rrb- <sssss> and the calamari -lrb- which was good , nothing special -rrb- . <sssss> i had the meatball pizza as my entree and it was good , nothing to complain about . <sssss> overall the service was excellent but food was average . 
4		ive found that if the tmp location doesnt have something in my size , this one will . <sssss> its hidden just north of the exit for ray / i 10 south . <sssss> ive never had a problem w / customer service here and , unlike the one at tmp , i like that they have a traditional register set up . <sssss> i love the worthington line for work . <sssss> chic , modern , and cheap -lrb- in price , not value -rrb- . <sssss> awesome . 
4		brought home some take out ribs . <sssss> figured i needed to do it quick because every other restaurant hat has been in this location has closed up not to long after opening . <sssss> have to say the ribs were meaty , the meat was tender , the sauce was tasty . <sssss> hope they stay in business long enough for a return visit . 
4		delicious sushi ! <sssss> probably one of the best sushi restaurants in phoenix and it 's fairly new ! <sssss> if you 're near pv mall then stop in and have dinner ! 
4		i love this place ! <sssss> this location does seem a little bit more `` cozy '' than the biltmore location . <sssss> the bartenders shawn and ashton were awesome . <sssss> the food , as always delish ! <sssss> the kale aid , crudité , burger -lrb- med rare -rrb- & tuscan kale hit the spot !!! 
4		only been here once . <sssss> excellent service and the food was great , beer too ! 
4		how cute is this bistro ! <sssss> i absolutely love this place ! <sssss> went to la petite france with some girlfriends who wanted to celebrate my 40th birthday , and was very thrilled this was the place that was picked , have been wanting to try them for a while now ! <sssss> when we got their we were greeted with a friendly warm welcomed and showed to our table . <sssss> the place inside is just so cute ! <sssss> i love the paris clock next the coffee maker . <sssss> i ordered the la jardiniere -lrb- spinach & mushroom quiches -rrb- and was exactly how i expected it to be . <sssss> light , fluffy , and very very tastly ! <sssss> the dough was amazing , come to find out , they make their own dough by hand and everything is cooked in a brick oven . <sssss> my friends ordered the vegetarienne tarte flambees , which was loaded with crème fresh , fresh tasting veggies and cheese , and that too was amazing . <sssss> the food was c'est magnifique ! <sssss> also had a carmel café , which was devine ! <sssss> loved it ! <sssss> ca n't wait to come back and try other items on the menu ! <sssss> one for sure is the crème brulee !! <sssss> it 's one of my favorite desserts ! 
4		great atmosphere and service to match . <sssss> a great addition to the neighborhood ! 
4		this place is awesome . <sssss> they brought my party free smothered tacos , awesome . <sssss> plus the food is great . <sssss> it was a little greasy , but eating most mexican food typically is . <sssss> they add guacamole to everything . <sssss> the rest of my party got tortas , they were very flavorful . 
4		this is the normal valle luna that i go to . <sssss> excellent chips and hot sauce . <sssss> they seem to have specials every night , so waits are common . <sssss> 15-20 minutes are the average , if you come after 6pm . <sssss> i find the males servers to be below average . <sssss> the older lady servers do an excellent job , even in the chaotic evening rush . <sssss> i love the chimichanga here . <sssss> pinto beans are spicy but pretty good . <sssss> rice is average . <sssss> parking can be tough here , too . <sssss> they used to have good half price coupons , but not so much , lately . 
4		free wi-fi = win ! <sssss> not super high tech . <sssss> would benefit from a rail system to transfer terminals but the buses work well enough . <sssss> decent priced parking at terminal 2 economy -lrb- $ 11/day -rrb- . <sssss> tricky to figure out where to escape your first couple of times with the alternating north and south entrances/exits but now i have to down to a system . <sssss> some cute local food vendors . <sssss> no complaints . 
4		i came to the pita house for the free wifi , which is really convenient . <sssss> the food is pretty standard , but good . <sssss> i especially liked the hummus . <sssss> the atmosphere is pretty friendly , the waiters all seemed really nice , and only slightly weirded out that i was on my laptop there ! 
4		just flew in and our of phoenix earlier today and this place was very nice . <sssss> lovely service - friendly , very friendly , and prompt - food was hot and juicy ! <sssss> nice chicken breasts and the cheese was still melted / melting when it hit the table . <sssss> with a sam adams , well that is nice . <sssss> then off to the next plane ! <sssss> thanks roadhouse ! 
4		just moved to the neighborhood and this place is just around the corner . <sssss> very small place , but definitely embraces the local arts scene with lots of art inside as well as lit up empty liquor and wine bottles on the wall . <sssss> bar maximus is attached as well for more space and lively atmosphere . <sssss> food is very eclectic . <sssss> i had a pizza , but not just any pizza . <sssss> sausage , cheddar cheese , and jelly -lrb- yes , jelly -rrb- . <sssss> unusual ? <sssss> you bet . <sssss> tasty ? <sssss> very . <sssss> the waitress was very friendly and the owner also came by to check on us . <sssss> my one disappointment was the beer and wine list . <sssss> it was pretty limited in variety . <sssss> might be an area for improvement . <sssss> that said , very happy to have this neighborhood hangout spot . <sssss> would gladly take friends here . 
4		wow what a great hotel ! <sssss> super friendly staff checked me in . <sssss> water in the lobby as well as gorgeous art and fun bicycles ?? <sssss> they have a free happy hour on the second level - very nice and great wine while i was there . <sssss> coffee in the morning is also located at the same spot so you can get a cup on your way out . <sssss> this hotel is convenient to dinner spots too and many of the business located in downtown phoenix . <sssss> i think they must be dog friendly too because i saw a lot of dogs here . <sssss> however my room did not smell like ` dog ' so this is one place that does ` dog-friendly ' right ! <sssss> the room was huge and instantly reminded me of a ritz . <sssss> very clean lines and fun art . <sssss> the bathrobes were adorable with tiger trim . <sssss> will definitely be back ! 
4		everyone knows that i love pizza & vino , so if you share my love for a great pie and a glass of grape juice look no further for your next big night out . <sssss> classic italian is well hidden under the clock tower in the waterworks mall at baseline/lakeshore rd. in tempe az. but well worth finding . <sssss> the pizzas are hand stretched & prepared in a wood fire brick oven using pecan wood ! <sssss> my favorte of the bunch is called the 4 seasons , wow what a pizza . <sssss> the crust is delicate & thin , the house made sauce is wonrderful and there is always a reasonably priced bottle of wine to pair with everything on the menu . <sssss> the ambiance is comfortable and the service has always been good . <sssss> a great place for date night ! <sssss> do it ! 
4		got the combination plate , i 'm not very familiar with middle eastern food so i 'm not sure i 'm a good judge . <sssss> the gyro meat was a little greasy . <sssss> . <sssss> i liked the thing that looked like egg roll and the thing that looked like hush puppies . <sssss> . <sssss> was n't a huge fan of the thing that looked like dark corn bread and the salad type couscous thing . <sssss> the chicken kabob , koobideh and beef kabobs were not very flavorful and slightly burned . <sssss> loved the pistachio baklavas ! <sssss> which is why i 'm giving it 4 stars . <sssss> . <sssss> : -rrb- 
4		for real vinyl collectors , this is the place to go . <sssss> they 've got an excellent collection of most of the classic genre 's -lrb- funk , soul , rock , etc. -rrb- but if you 're looking for rarer stuff , i suggest hitting up grandiose . <sssss> most of the records here are decently priced and the quality tends to be great too . <sssss> the thing i love about this place is that it 's a real , dirt-under-the-nail records store . <sssss> stepping in , you can tell that this place has a history as long as most of the lp 's they sell . <sssss> this place is a shrine to good taste in music and a sanctuary for those who know what 's good . <sssss> as far as issues i have with the place , i think they have way too much john denver era type recordings and not enough funk/soul/r & b. it 's a question of personal taste and that 's all . <sssss> besides that , this place is a total hole in the wall which is why i love it and why i think it continues to remain one of downtown phoenix 's best kept secrets . 
4		good liquor selection . <sssss> great signature drinks . <sssss> reminds me of a bar in chicago , new york , or london . <sssss> to get inside you have to go around the restaurant or through an alley . <sssss> then up the stairs to a hidden gem . <sssss> the rustic brick wall and cheeky decor make for a great upscale atmosphere with plenty of people watching . <sssss> amazing guest dj 's bring back a sense of nostalgia . <sssss> projection tv on the brick wall makes for some interesting entertainment if the people watching gets dull . <sssss> the owner is now featuring local artists ' work on his walls . <sssss> looses a star for 2 things . <sssss> dead on the week days -lrb- that may change with time -rrb- and it is kind of small . 
4		my niece insisted we eat here after her asu graduation ceremony . <sssss> o.m.g ! <sssss> so glad we did ! <sssss> parking is a bit scarce . <sssss> while we waited for seating the hostess offered us all beverages in their scenic private drive which has ample benches to sit . <sssss> we were seated inside where the ambiance was quaint . <sssss> they had black and white t.v 's playing the lone ranger and frank sinatra playing in the background . <sssss> now the food ... incredible . <sssss> if you leave hungry its your own fault . <sssss> portion sizes are huge and everything is made fresh . <sssss> the bruchetta was delicious and the ziti ... perfect . <sssss> thinking there was no way i could shove another bite into my mouth , they bring out the pizooki . <sssss> it was all over . <sssss> the combination of the gooey chocolate chip cookie and the creamy vanilla ice cream did me in . <sssss> it was glorious ! <sssss> i left in a near food coma and could not be happier . <sssss> my only regret is that there are n't any near me in california . 
4		i ordered 7 sandwiches and several other items . <sssss> everything was ready and bagged when i arrived . <sssss> when i got to the office to and distributed the sandwiches , i noticed there was a sandwich missing . <sssss> the first person wanted me to drive back to their store to pick up the sandwich . <sssss> when i told him i was going to drive back to their store because of their mistake , he transferred me to a manager . <sssss> the manager took control of the situation and said she would deliver the sandwich . <sssss> better late than never . 
4		i got my first happy hour glass of wine bought it at the 5th and wine drank it till my face turned red was the summer in the 2000s me and some guys from work had a craving so we ordered some food glass of wine , plate of bruschetta shoulda known , we 've finished it all oh when i look back now that summer seemed to last forever and if i had the choice yeah , i 'd always want to be there those were the best of 5th and wine -lrb- bryan adams - summer of 69 -rrb- 5th and wine is located right in the heart of old town scottsdale . <sssss> off 5th ave and goldwater . <sssss> it 's snugged inside the art area . <sssss> i 've always enjoy coming here during hh ! <sssss> $ 5 for a glass of wine ! <sssss> they have a huge list to choose from so you wo n't be missing out on any of your favorites . <sssss> my gang and i ordered a plate of bruschetta and we were good ! <sssss> hummus , steak , prosciutto , and apple/brie on a nice plate and atop a crunchy bread -- yum ! <sssss> totally enjoyed this combo with my wine -- my favorite is pinot noir . <sssss> though i did try their burgers ; i would try to stick with food that goes well with your wine . <sssss> i think the burgers are pretty original with different ingreidients like bison with corn , but man it did n't do much for me . <sssss> the place itself is pretty casual and classy with some interesting artwork . <sssss> there 's a small living room-like area where you could chill while people watch . <sssss> however , this is also the area where the band generally plays . <sssss> live music every thursday , friday , and saturday nights ! <sssss> - enjoy ! 
4		who would have thought that there was a lake with boats and ski jets in the metro phoenix area ? <sssss> my wife and i sailed the desert belle for about 90 minutes if my memory serves me correctly and enjoyed nature . <sssss> there are eagles and an assortment of wild life surrounding the lake . <sssss> i thought it was cool to see a bunch of cactus right next to the water . <sssss> they serves beverages of all kinds , popcorn and other snacks . <sssss> they do rent out the boat for parties . <sssss> so this would be a great booze cruise . <sssss> although i 'm not sure how much you can see when the sun has set . <sssss> they have entertainment on the evening cruise but not on the afternoon cruise . <sssss> this cruise was a nice diversion from all the other sights that are out there and is definitely worth going on a second time . <sssss> quick tip , the second deck is crowded but the lower deck is almost deserted . <sssss> i do n't think you see anything more by sitting upstairs . 
4		would have given them 3 1/2 - food was four star but service made them lose some . <sssss> gracious hostess who sat us right away at a table near the bar . <sssss> really lovely room and interesting , eclectic blend of southwestern and other styles . <sssss> lighting was very complimentary to all - got ta love that ! <sssss> good margaritas , delicious skirt steak tacos , the white bean purée was fabulous as were the green beans . <sssss> and the pumpkin bread pudding was one of best desserts i 've had in some time . <sssss> so what was wrong ? <sssss> service was so rushed i felt like there was a timer on the back of our chairs . <sssss> message was loud and clear - hurry up and eat and get out !!! 
4		this is a meet & greet place from the looks of the serious and not so serious conversations taking place at the tables . <sssss> men in suits . <sssss> or with marvelous tats . <sssss> women in flowing native american skirts . <sssss> or lulu togs . <sssss> come as you are . <sssss> or as you wan na be . <sssss> breakfast is wonderful . <sssss> i liked the breakfast sandwich , stacked with a rich yellow egg , bacon , gruyere cheese , and wasabi mayo . <sssss> coffee is dark french press , and left in a an ergonomic , triangular pot at your table . <sssss> i think i left a dusty colored scarf with net and glitter running though it beneath the table . <sssss> if it 's true that you leave something behind when you unconsciously hope to return , i 'll make it back to breakfast club one day . 
4		well we are goin ' to the rose and crown and there 's nothing you can do oh yes we 're on our way and theres nothing you can do so we are goin ' to the rose and crown and have a few brews ! <sssss> we do n't refer to the menu when showing up we just order -lrb- fish and chips -rrb- our generation gap means we prefer them with ketchup the drinks is getting to your head the drinks is in my hands ! <sssss> -lrb- lyrics - the living end - prisoner of society -rrb- the rose and crown is located across from pizzaeria bianco and next to nobuo 's teeter house . <sssss> aside from bar bianco i think this place would be great as you wait the lines of these two great restaurants . <sssss> the rose and crown is a pub , also known as a public bar . <sssss> public bar ? <sssss> are n't all bars public ? <sssss> well grasshopper , according to the `` internet '' , in the uk , many hotels have bars that are generally private to their guest . <sssss> thus , the invention of public bars known as pubs . <sssss> now , back to phoenix ! <sssss> the rose and crown offers up a plethora of beers in pints , bottles , or 20oz . <sssss> needless to say you 're options will get your head spinning . <sssss> i stuck to my guns and went with a stella - haha ! <sssss> i also ordered off their menu -- whoops ! <sssss> i should n't have referred their , but i did and went with the fish and chips ; i 'm in a pub , what do you expect !? <sssss> overall , this was probably the best fish and chips i had . <sssss> the fish was moist in the inside and the bread crust around it was perfect and crispy . <sssss> i 'm a texture guy when it comes to food and the fish and chips was a kick in the goalllllllll ! <sssss> yes , soccer fans this place is a mecca of soccer decor and perfect for your next soccer outing , or should i say futbol ? <sssss> i 'm not much of a fan , but i sure know where to go the next world cup comes along . <sssss> - enjoy ! 
4		i 've eaten here a few times before , when it was pink pepper , but never had the lunch buffet . <sssss> a few days ago i decided to check out the buffet offerings . <sssss> everything had great flavor , but i found it all lacking in the spice department . <sssss> i know they are trying to make food that is palatable for the masses and one can always add chilies , but i generally prefer my thai food to arrive pre-spiced . <sssss> that said , however , i would definitely go back for more and i did - a few times in fact . <sssss> the thai tea was some of the best i 've ever had , i had to order one to go so i could prolong the sweet creamy deliciousness as long as possible . <sssss> to top it all off the service was great , and i ca n't wait to go back ! 
4		conveniently located near the scottsdale fashon , this place is great for a nice lunch before you shop 'til you drop . <sssss> the restaurant doubles as a marketplace , so you can buy some goods while you 're there too . <sssss> the decor is clean and fresh and simply done . <sssss> now on to the food . <sssss> the one thing to describe their food -lrb- at least the two dishes i tried there -rrb- is lots and lots of oil . <sssss> maybe that 's why it tasted so good . <sssss> the funghi trifolati flatbread was recommended . <sssss> the mushroom and arugula is a wonderful pairing for the simple dish . <sssss> the tallegio cheese stretches beautiful when i took a bite . <sssss> the only thing i wished was that the thin bread was more crispy . <sssss> it was too soft for my taste . <sssss> and of course they drenched it with olive oil . <sssss> the mushroom tortelli ordered was a light classic dish that was cooked wonderfully as well . <sssss> i preferred this dish over the flatbread . <sssss> the ravioli was cooked a bit adante which was great , and the flavors blended well with the mushroom . <sssss> what i remembered of the sauce was that it was light and drenched in oil again . <sssss> see the trend ? <sssss> :--rrb- but overall , i would give a thumbs up for olive & ivy . <sssss> happy eating in 2013 ! 
4		our first visit . <sssss> a nice place with a charming al fresco patio - a good place to take out-of-town visitors for a southwestern experience . <sssss> since it 's on the dreamy draw cycling route and very close to the arizona canal cycling path , a fine place to stop and lunch if one 's on a ride in the area . <sssss> the flour chips and salsa were delicious , the fish tacos and the pollo fundido were yum , and ice cold modelo amber is on tap ! <sssss> service was fast and attentive - my one complaint is that while a bottle of cold water hit the table immediately , water glasses never did appear . <sssss> i suspect that milady wife and i will become regular clients . <sssss> food - three and a half stars , service four , and ambience a solid five . 
4		good place to go if you need varies kinds of items . <sssss> of sometimes you do n't need a 55 gallons barrel of stuff ... lol but a great place and great people !! 
4		i have been to many musicals and christmas shows here over the years and have always been very happy with the performances . <sssss> we have seen everything from stomp to beauty and the beast ! <sssss> always top notch ! <sssss> the only complaint is that the restrooms really really really need a makeover ! <sssss> they are old and falling apart . <sssss> also there just are not enough and the ladies line is always very long . <sssss> the ushers are always very nice and helpful and you really get a great performance . <sssss> going to gammage at christmas for the shows is a great tradition i hope to continue with my family . 
4		just ate at pita pit on mill ave for the first time the other night & loved it . <sssss> they do it subway style where you pick all of your toppings from a large assortment of veggies & dressings . <sssss> the pita bread is soft & chewy , the veggies were fresh , the hummus was delicious . <sssss> and the cherry on top was the super friendly service . <sssss> there were 2 girls working & they could n't have been nicer . <sssss> i see a lot of falafels in my future . 
4		in grade school , one of my best friends , pranav , had me over his house a couple of times for dinner . <sssss> his mom cooked the most bizarre , yet flavourful food my near-virginal midwestern tastebuds had ever yet encountered . <sssss> at the time , i remember not really being sure i liked it , and at the same time craving to go back and have some more ! <sssss> when i recently began to work nearby to india palace and saw their sign for the lunch boofay , i thought back to those days in pranav 's stinky house and marched right inside with my 9 bucks in hand . <sssss> they are a little more classy than the pay-first boofays , as you are seated and served drinks by waiters , and will get your bill later . <sssss> at first glance , the bufett table seemed smallish to me , but once i started scooping out the various gloops onto my pile of rice & veggies , it really added up fast . <sssss> there were plenty of choices labeled as meat/no meat , and with the dishes ' names , although i still had to consult the menu to decipher what gloop i was scooping . <sssss> for the non-adventurous in your family or group , there is some nice almost-plain jasmine rice and tandoori chicken -lrb- simple skinless barbecued chicken pieces that taste like the best picnic cooked-over-a-charcoal-grill chicken you can remember -rrb- . <sssss> for those a little more adventurous , just try it all . <sssss> they do not stock the exact same items each day , so it is a must to go on different days to sample all you can . <sssss> you can round out your meal with some fresh veggies , although not really a full fledged salad-bar -lrb- not like the veg-heads do n't have plenty to choose from here -rrb- , and i loooooove the mango chutney , mint/cilantro/whatever sauce , and tamarind sauce . <sssss> i get a big bowl of each and use it all up -- no waste ! <sssss> goes great with the freshly made naan bread that you get with your meal . <sssss> my grade school friend pranav is a big-shot doctor now in boston , but i 'd love to have that chance to take him here and find out if it 's as authentic as it seems to be . <sssss> judging by the large volume of indian clientelle that i always see here , it probably is . <sssss> i always find that to be a great way to judge any ethnic eatery or grocery store . <sssss> watch out for the -lrb- anise ? -rrb- <sssss> near the register . <sssss> it 's not as close to an after-dinner mint as i was led to believe . <sssss> ps : not sure if others would have the same experience , but my 12 y.o. did not like this place at all , and since they stop the ` kid 's price ' quite young , at like 9 or so here , i learned to save my cash and not bring her . 
4		i love the greene house , the only reason i 'm giving it less than 5-stars is because of the noise level . <sssss> that being said , i wish i could do partial stars ! <sssss> this is so very close ! <sssss> i 've been here many times and while i have n't had the entrees , i can readily comment on the appetizers . <sssss> the smoked salmon bruschetta is to die for ! <sssss> black mussels are plentiful and perfectly cooked every time . <sssss> herb hummus is a personal favorite of mine . <sssss> for a more substantial appetizer , the warm brie or tempura calamari would be excellent . <sssss> the wines are delicious from the house white or red to their sunday special . <sssss> great beers too including three locally brewed ones . <sssss> the wait staff is always friendly and courteous . <sssss> again , my only comment would have to be the higher ambient noise level though i may be judging a little harshly based on the size of the place and the proximity of other people at other tables . <sssss> after all , noise does mean people are having fun , right ? <sssss> i love this place ... 4.8 stars though yelp wo n't let me rate it as such . 
4		great selection of about 30 mostly european beers along with maybe five wines on tap . <sssss> a pretty basic food menu . <sssss> an $ 11 order of tacos gives you two tasty tacos , probably not enough for a full dinner . <sssss> nice , pretty spacious outdoor patio . <sssss> definitely go for the beer . 
4		on sunday and monday they have a raw menu and i highly suggest you give it a try . <sssss> the prices are a tad higher but the resulting flavors are awesome . <sssss> check out the dehydrated crackers and cinnamon rolls ! <sssss> the owners are really friendly and helpful as well . 
4		i love this place ! <sssss> steve is the best ! 
4		my wife and i stopped by the bell road location today prompted by a recent article in the paper . <sssss> we both had one of their amazing hot dogs and found them to be the best we 've ever experienced . <sssss> the decor is exactly what you would expect from the name and the staff was cordial and helpful in a casual way . <sssss> in short : great place , good food and very reasonable prices ! <sssss> check t out ! 
4		with several middle eastern friends , i get a little picky because i get homemade food . <sssss> byblos was recommended to my boyfriend and me by a gentleman in changing hands who overheard me saying i missed our friend 's hummus -lrb- they moved back to israel -rrb- , so we decided to check it out , and we were so happy we did ! <sssss> the older gentleman who served us had a lovely accent and demeanor , and he was very helpful with choosing appetizers and entrees . <sssss> the decore is a little sparse i suppose , but the food makes up for it . <sssss> we had the hummus and shish-kabobs that were delicious . <sssss> the hummus was as close as we 've found to our israeli friend 's , so needless to say that would have been enough to captivate our senses . <sssss> we will definitely be going back ! 
4		it 's a little bike shop in the hood , and they have been fixing flats and stuff for me for years . <sssss> i also frequent a few other bike shops that i like better but not as close to home . <sssss> service is always fast and prices are on the `` fair '' side . <sssss> bob always seems a bit cranky - no pun intended , but he is competent and quick with the repairs . <sssss> i noticed some nice bikes for a great price today , i think i might go back for an upgrade . <sssss> does a bike shop have to be a friendly place ??? <sssss> no not really , but the ones i like the best are . <sssss> take a look at the small well priced selection of raleigh bikes , and for quick service just off the green belt this place is a great option . 
4		i have been to smash two times now and have had a consistent experience both times . <sssss> my burger was tasty covered in bbq sauce , haystack onions and bacon . <sssss> my fries were crisp and best dipped in a side of chipotle ranch -lrb- make sure you ask for it , it 's free ! -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> you spend about 10 bucks for the burger and fries , but when you compare that with the various burger places nearby where 10 bucks gets you just the burger , smash is n't so pricey . 
4		a welcome addition to the arcadia neighborhood . <sssss> as of this writing i 've tried the bravas fries , two of their pizzas , one of their pastas and one of their piadinas/flat breads . <sssss> all exceeded expectations . <sssss> excellent beer selection and , from what i could tell a solid wine offering as well . <sssss> ask about their beer club . <sssss> knowledgeable , friendly and attentive staff in a nice atmosphere and a misting system on their patio that , believe it or not , is strong enough to make 108 not only tolerable but enjoyable . <sssss> reasonably priced - which given the location is n't a given . <sssss> i 'd like to see this one stay around for a while . 
4		loved the pizza . <sssss> they had a great selection . <sssss> services was n't bad . <sssss> the wings are also tasty . <sssss> it was the breakfast of champions ! <sssss> ; ^ d 
4		the true test of a pedicure ? <sssss> it 's almost a month later and my toes still look great . 
4		it was a friday night , my wife had been on yelp looking for a good place to grab dinner before we went downtown to the ballet -lrb- the in-laws bought us tickets , i had to go ! -rrb- <sssss> , we decided to check out centurion in the upcoming `` historic '' district on roosevelt . <sssss> it 's a quaint diner on the street surrounded by old brick buildings with a small patio . <sssss> we posted up in the corner on a couple of couches , the server was prompt in greeting us and getting our drink order , i ordered an ipa and my wife had a red italian wine after a recommendation by the server . <sssss> my wife was happy with the recommendation , it was a good wine for her taste . <sssss> next we ordered our entree 's , i had the lamb shank 's and waffles with chorizo risotto and my wife had their bleu cheese crusted fillet with white truffle risotto . <sssss> the lamb was cooked perfectly and was very flavorful , the kicker for me was the chorizo risotto , it was light 's - out ! <sssss> a truly balanced plate of food . <sssss> my wife 's plate was also good , but her fillet was ordered medium-rare and it came out medium-well , which is unfortunate . <sssss> she still enjoyed the cut , she was impressed with the bleu-cheese crust , and she is not a bleu cheese person at all . <sssss> the white-truffle risotto was good , cooked perfectly but not as thrilling as my chorizo risotto . <sssss> the only other disappointment we had beside the overcooked fillet was when we went back later that night for desert my wife had realized that the owner had come out and greeted almost every other table that night aside from ours . <sssss> after spending over $ 120 between dinner and dessert we felt deserving of the same treament , i 'm sure it was n't intentional and wo n't stop us from coming back , but it was the difference between 4 and 5 stars for this review . <sssss> next time i 'm confident centurion will redeem itself , we recommend it for a nice , upscale night out on the town . 
4		so many options ! <sssss> i love coming to goodwill because you can pretty much get an entirely new wardrobe for cheap . <sssss> half off saturdays are my favorite as i can really stock up on some great items . <sssss> lately i have been truly blessed in finding items that still had the original tags on them and being able to snag these items for around $ 4.50 each . <sssss> score !! <sssss> every goodwill is different and i do check out a few of them , but i do enjoy coming to this one as it is a little bigger . <sssss> i do wish they had more dressing rooms but all in all , you ca n't go wrong at goodwill ! 
4		is this great sushi ? <sssss> no . <sssss> does this food reinvent the sushi wheel ? <sssss> not even close . <sssss> will i have a foodgasm ? <sssss> not a chance . <sssss> when i am craving an amazing sushi meal , i 'll go to yasu . <sssss> why i really , really like teharu : the food is fresh . <sssss> while it 's not amazing fish , there 's nothing wrong with it - nothing here to get sick from . <sssss> all the standards are readily available and if you want something not already on the belt , they 'll gladly make it for you . <sssss> the conveyor really feeds into my lack of patience . <sssss> i sat down , ordered an iced green tea , and started pulling plates off the belt . <sssss> yes , i was eating sushi within 90 seconds of sitting down ! <sssss> the price is a huge plus ! <sssss> i met a friend for lunch - we each had iced tea , several plates with 3 or 4 roll slices , seaweed salad , sunumono salad and a couple nigiri and i was out of there for less than $ 20 , including tip . <sssss> the place is kept incredibly clean , staff is friendly and teharu fills a nice niche for a super casual , quick sushi place . <sssss> when it comes down to it , i ca n't always afford to spend what that quantity of food would cost me at yasu or any of the other great places in town - i like that i am not committing to a whole roll - i can sample from 5 or 6 different ones . <sssss> fills the need for the sushi craving on a buget and/or when strapped for time . 
4		had dinner there last night . <sssss> the calzone was awesome and had a lot of fun with the wait staff . <sssss> thanks for playing along nicole . 
4		too bad the construction along main street in mesa can inhibit people from coming in ! <sssss> i had their , i believe it was called , green chili chicken sandwhich . <sssss> it was so good . <sssss> chicken , green chili , pepperjack -lrb- ? -rrb- <sssss> on ciabatta . <sssss> i 'd definitely reccomend that . <sssss> also , i had the butterscotch cookie . <sssss> the cashier warned me it was very sweet , and it really was . <sssss> i could only take a few bites before i put the rest away for later . <sssss> maybe that 's a good thing ! <sssss> that cookie was huge ! <sssss> it 's a nice little mom and pop place . <sssss> it was busy when i went . <sssss> the people who worked there were very nice and friendly . <sssss> it 's just a shame that it 's hard to get to because of the construction . <sssss> if i had n't been with a colleague who 'd been there before who said it was really good , i would have driven past it because parking was far from the place . <sssss> but good find ! <sssss> it was on one of those tlc shows too . <sssss> check it out ! 
4		and i love the gypsy bar . <sssss> you can play arcade games , and go next door to go bowling too ! <sssss> they also , as i found last week have a photo booth . <sssss> yayskies . <sssss> the drinks are reasonably priced , and every time ive gone , mostly saturdays for peep me xoxo , the music is freaking awesome . <sssss> and there is live painting by a variety of artists weekly , i myself have painted there on occasion . <sssss> super cool setup , very respectful of their talent . <sssss> go have a good time ! 
4		love the place , dark yet character . <sssss> food was great the beer was nice and cold . <sssss> . <sssss> will come back . <sssss> when i visit ... 
4		like their terriyaki bowl and also the bulgogi , sushi is also a good choice here are well . <sssss> have n't ventured much on their other items maybe one day ... 
4		like so many things in arizona , this was whole foods on steroids . <sssss> organic , grass fed steroids , but f-ing steroids . <sssss> the place is huge , and i kept wanting to go back and just see what else they had . <sssss> i never thought i would be susceptible to produce section envy , but comparing it to our local whole foods in san francisco , i just did n't feel ours measures up :-lrb- i had to go back for a second visit to make sure i had n't dreamt this place up . <sssss> no , it was real . <sssss> the plentiful parking was real . <sssss> minus one star , for the very real and slow ass coffee bar people . 
4		upscale but not too pricey , for what it is . <sssss> every employee was cordial and helpful . <sssss> the decor is comfortable chic . <sssss> for a saturday night , it was -lrb- too -rrb- quiet . <sssss> good location , walking distance to don and charlie 's - a great steak house . 
4		university club is a membership club in central phoenix . <sssss> i do not have a membership but have attended meetings and a wedding at the club as a guest in the past . <sssss> you can go on-line to see rates for this under `` membership '' . <sssss> the wedding , we attended was a while ago but i distinctively remember how beautiful it was out on outside garden . <sssss> the ceremony and dinner was outside and it was gorgeous . <sssss> it almost felt like we were not in phoenix , but removed far far away in some plush other land with greens and plants surrounding us ! <sssss> the food was catered by university club and was delicious . <sssss> i remember the staff being kind . <sssss> as for the meetings i have attended inside the club , they were very nice as well . <sssss> nothing fancy dancy over the top , but had a lot of old phoenix charm . <sssss> the club is an old renovated 1917 house and each of the dining rooms are parts of the house , it 's really neat . <sssss> it 's like being in someones home but not . <sssss> go to the website and check out the photos ! <sssss> http://www.universityclubphoenix.com/ 
4		i took the recommendation for the wlnut shrimp and it was incredible . <sssss> the place was clean and i enjoyed it atmosphere . <sssss> the serve was incredibly attentive and quick . <sssss> i thought the sizzling rice soup was bland but i believe that is by design because i have never tried a highly flavored sizzling rice soup . <sssss> i am eager to return and try more options from their menu . 
4		your milkshakes brings me back to your restaurant , and you 're like , `` awesome , cool ! '' <sssss> but seriously , whenever my wife and i go , it is always one milkshake , sweet potato or truffle fries , and an awesome burger . <sssss> i see people saying it is pricey and the burgers are ok . <sssss> on the other hand , there burgers are quality meat with toppings that shine bright like a diamond . <sssss> i really do n't know why i said that , maybe adding to the milkshake theme i had going earlier , but in all honesty , there are various toppings to choose from that makes them different than any chain burger place . <sssss> the location is great with the decor and ambience relaxing for a great date night in the biltmore area . <sssss> i can not complain about service , because it has always been top notch whenever we went . <sssss> you definitely pay what you get for being in the biltmore area . <sssss> we will see you again you delicious milkshake and sweet potato fry ! 
4		to date , i have been to sens twice now , oddly enough as a guest to two of the bartenders at the turf . <sssss> was drinking on a saturday night when one of the bartenders who was off the clock was hanging out , asked if i wanted to head over to sens and grab a bite to eat . <sssss> i obviously said `` yes '' so we walked across the hallway and up to the bar , it was 2:25 or so and the kitchen staff was cleaning up , she asked if the kitchen was closed or if they can still serve food , we got a nod of approval and quickly put in an order , two plates of the duck + mint + ginger salad , an order of soup gyoza and shu mai . <sssss> everything was excellent , the duck salad is amazing 5 stars for sure . <sssss> the dumplings were both excellent as well . <sssss> the graciousness of bar waitress and the kitchen staff was amazing considering the time . <sssss> second time eating at sens , was not quite harmonious . <sssss> i was asked previously to my first visit if i wanted to try sens , and while neither myself or the bartender requesting my presence had been here yet , i agreed and we agreed upon a time and date where she would be off work around the same time i would get home from work . <sssss> we headed over to sens , now at this point i 've already had some experience with the menu and the food , plus i 'm not a stranger to asian food . <sssss> this time i ordered the soup gyoza , fried tofu and the sugar cane , my accompaniment tried the miso with shrimp . <sssss> now this is where i can not justify a 5th star ... i received all 3 of my dishes before they even started her miso soup . <sssss> :-lrb- i held off eating while we both waited for her food , i offered some of my selections as it was enough to share and still be happy with it . <sssss> but it still did n't put off the annoyance of not having your own dish in front of you . <sssss> it was finally served a long 8 minutes later , roughly , and she liked it . <sssss> only complaint beyond the delay was that the shrimp were a little overcooked . <sssss> all in all good experiences for trying something fairly new . <sssss> i 'll certainly return , price was n't all that bad and the drinks are pretty good . <sssss> but nothing i would go there for strictly . <sssss> i 'm not a huge fan of sake or vodka . <sssss> they do have other things to pore , but the drink specialties are all sake or vodka . <sssss> : \ 
4		when i returned early december for a birthday get together -lrb- mine -rrb- , i was suddenly nervous about having dragged about 15 tempe residents out to downtown to a place none had been to and most had never heard of , where there is no parking and drinks are relatively expensive . <sssss> but hanny 's did n't make a fool of me . <sssss> the server - like last time , was charged with serving an amorphous group of fast drinkers who kept wandering off to take pictures , play in the elevator shaft or slide on the tongue couch - excelled . <sssss> patient , friendly and informative . <sssss> in fact , when some drinks erroneously landed on one person 's tab - there were several separate checks at our table - she removed them without awkwardness or even so much as an eye roll . <sssss> music neither impressed nor -lrb- more importantly -rrb- annoyed - mostly soul and r&b mixes - and the disappearing/reappearing dj trick is a good one . <sssss> i was almost talked into moving the party to the district , where i was told beers were $ 3 and the atmosphere was something i might enjoy . <sssss> glad i did n't -lrb- esp . <sssss> after reading some of the yelp reviews for it ! -rrb- <sssss> hanny 's , i will continue to make the effort to come to your establishment , which is neither close to me or easy to : find/send people to/park around . <sssss> you 're asking a lot , but keep up the good work , work out the kinks and i 'll keep making the effort . 
4		come here for the rosa . <sssss> it 's special . <sssss> like potentially waiting in line for the rest of your life , special . <sssss> just look at the breakdown of this thing : http://eater.com/archives/2013/08/28/eater-elements-the-rosa-at-pizzeria-bianco.php salty , intense parmesan-reggiano , rosemary , red onions , and smokey pistachios are inconsistently , but uniformly , distributed over some damn good crust , no sauce allowed , for one hell of a taste-bud roller coaster . <sssss> i know you want it . <sssss> you know you want it . 
4		it does n't look like much from the outside . <sssss> sandwiched between a great biker bar -lrb- if you 're into that kind of thing -rrb- and an oriental rug mart , you may be wondering if you need to brush up on your bar fighting skills . <sssss> oh contraire , mon freire . <sssss> open the door to razz 's and you 'll probably see a bar full of patrons , people eating and laughing , eclectic art on the amber hued walls , and razz behind the open-kitchen bar . <sssss> with his thin , grey ponytail and snifter of scotch , raz commands an audience . <sssss> and people line up to sit at the bar and watch him preare their food and entertain them with his charm and effortless command of his staff . <sssss> we 've eaten at razz 's a dozen times . <sssss> the food is always good . <sssss> except for the seafood beggar 's purse . <sssss> i personally believe that you should n't eat anything with the words beggar , dirty or dick in it . <sssss> so , skip the beggars purse . <sssss> everything else on the menu is well executed , if somewhat pedestrian . <sssss> foie gras topped fillet is an orgasm in your mouth to be sure . <sssss> macademia crusted halibut , with the flaky moist center send chills down my spine . <sssss> now is it innovative ; unique ? <sssss> not so much . <sssss> is it delicious ? <sssss> yes . <sssss> for a restaurant in a strip mall , they have turned their space limitations into assets . <sssss> what could be a dark and dingy location has become a warm intimate space with the feeling of being invited to dine with a very wealthy friend . <sssss> there are several burgandy lined booths , with warm lighting and local art throughout the space . <sssss> the staff are gracious and attentive without being boorish . <sssss> you 'll often see razz 's wife fluttering around the dining room -lrb- she has striking red hair -rrb- checking on diners . <sssss> they take care of their guests . 
4		this mall works for me due to convenience -lrb- i live within walking distance -rrb- . <sssss> otherwise , it is far below the standards of other malls i am used to frequenting . <sssss> however , i will say it has improved in recent years . <sssss> more popular stores have been added such as mac makeup store and even chipotle in the food court , and they are currently renovating the amc theaters to a nicer one with comfortable seats ! <sssss> i will continue to come here just due to the fact that i live nearby , but scottsdale fashion square mall and the biltmore mall are definitely way better if you are looking for store quality & quantity . 
4		as i am not a 19 year old girl there are n't many reasons for me to spend extended time at the marketplace . <sssss> i have heard good things about the pub and decided to make an exception . <sssss> the decor and ambiance are standard ` bar/pub ' . <sssss> the food was a pleasant notch above what you 'd get in the gordon biersches of the world . <sssss> definitely some of the better fish and chips in the valley . 
4		we attended the new years festivities so the menu was limited . <sssss> even so , ribeye cap and lamb shank were delicious . <sssss> lily was very good and attentive , as was the managerial staff . <sssss> look forward to trying this place not during the holidays , particularly for lunch . 
4		the original pizza cookie !? <sssss> there 's no better way to celebrate your birthday than a delicious 1/2 pound of chocolate chip , peanut butter chocolate , or white chocolate macadamia nut cookie dough baked a topped with three scoops of vanilla ice cream ! <sssss> well , there is , but only with oregano 's as a part of your special day -lrb- especially as it is free on your birthday -rrb- . <sssss> funny thing ... i went to oregano 's last night and did n't even get the original pizza cookie . <sssss> that is because i was filled up on a salad and pizza , both shared with a friend . <sssss> my friend and i enjoyed a delicious pablo picasso mexico salad -lrb- with chicken in it -rrb- though apparently then can substitute pinto beans for chicken for vegetarians . <sssss> if there 's just two of you , get the jr. instead of the full salad as it is already huge as a jr. . <sssss> we also ordered a pan pizza with several toppings . <sssss> we were warned that it would take 45-60 minutes for the pizza to come out and were pleased to see it show up in a half hour . <sssss> delicious but quite filling pizza ! <sssss> made for great leftovers though . <sssss> i have also enjoyed thin crust pizzas and several of the bottomless pastas in the past . <sssss> while sometimes the wait times can be longer than other times , the estimated wait times are usually pretty accurate . <sssss> parking at the paradise valley location is a breeze ! <sssss> definitely a pizza place that visitors to phoenix should go to regardless of which location , as it is only an arizona chain . 
4		yes i am a cj 's fan , have been since they brought out the western bacon cheeseburger in the 80 's ! <sssss> out of the big five ! <sssss> mickey d 's , jack in the crack , floppers , and wendy 's . <sssss> cj 's is my favorite ! <sssss> they have always changed their menu , always add something new , right now i like their memphis bbq burger ! <sssss> have n't tried their breakfast biscuits , but been told they are pretty good . <sssss> not a fan of their fries , other then that , it 's your typical fast food chain . <sssss> this location is new , nice to see that in this area ! <sssss> service is good right now . <sssss> can change as time goes on , anyway ! <sssss> nice to add this option in surprise !! 
4		i went here to catch up with a friend who just moved here from seattle . <sssss> we both really liked this place ! <sssss> i like that they have free music shows sometimes and the food is good -lrb- not the best food ever , but good -rrb- . <sssss> when we went , they had 5 $ sangria and it was really tasty . <sssss> i got the carne asada burrito and i liked the flavor , but the meat pieces were a little too small and it was a little too beany but i enjoyed it . <sssss> i would definitely go back . 
4		great happy hour sushi lunch . <sssss> . <sssss> danny the chef is the friendly as well as the manager and front of store staff . <sssss> -lrb- carolyn , loretta , -rrb- keep pouring the china mist tea . <sssss> . <sssss> :-rrb- . <sssss> . <sssss> good ownership too . <sssss> . <sssss> always there checking on the biz . <sssss> . <sssss> i travel to all the locations in phoenix , scottsdale and this location is the friendliest of the bunch . 
4		we like to stick with the mom 'n' pop shops , for the most part . <sssss> almost every chain we 've gone to over the years has gone downhill , while the smaller places work a little harder for your loyalty . <sssss> this place is not 100 % consistent , but i have to say that it is one of the better places . <sssss> i hate going places where the food seems like deep-fried dingleberries saturated with special sauce . <sssss> i usually get the orange chicken and it 's pretty light and crispy , not soggy . <sssss> the lunch specials are pretty fairly priced and good-sized portions . <sssss> one server is a little abrupt but she keeps my water filled , which is more than i can say for most places i go to . <sssss> they always look like they 're going to cry when i tip well . <sssss> i guess they are just used to people being cheap . 
4		awesome iced tea . <sssss> after a glass and half i was ready to conquer the world ! <sssss> i met the owner and his wife at a the grand opening of a charity thrift shop where they were handing out samples of their coffee and iced tea . <sssss> this coffee shop is located inside of the great indoors and i will definitely visit next time i am shopping there . 
4		i 've been taking classes here for sometime now . <sssss> i actually already have an associates in liberal arts from here and i 'm in the process of getting another in sign language . <sssss> after this semester i will be applying for their interpreting preparation program which is ranked in the top three programs in the state for the last time i checked . <sssss> joanne has been my advisor for two years now is the absolute best . <sssss> she has been there for me every step of the way and advised me in the right direction in every which way ! <sssss> the campus is usually always clean and the grounds are kept up daily . <sssss> i still prefer scottsdale community colleges campus over pc but its not bad . <sssss> i like that if your in a specific program majority of our classes are held in the same building so you do n't have to be running from one side of campus to another . <sssss> this campus is also in the process of remodeling and adding new buildings as well s parking structures . <sssss> i 'm looking forward to the new look ! <sssss> the staff here has been great i have yet to take a class and not like the professor . <sssss> i highly recommend , jeff stone , tamara henner , david bailey and michelle monhan for any american sign language or interpreting classes . <sssss> for english i highly recommend cristie roe . <sssss> all these professors go above and beyond to help their students and really take the time to make sure everyone understands the material that they are teaching . <sssss> t. c phoenix college is a great place to `` go far close to home '' . 
4		had family friends come in town and they wanted good mexican food and good fajitas . <sssss> serranos had both - the bean dip and salsa they bring to the table were excellent . <sssss> the service was great and our entrees were wonderful . <sssss> will be returning again soon ! 
4		awesome viet restaurant . <sssss> it 's in the middle of no where and it 's nothing fancy inside , but the service and food is fantastic . <sssss> we had summer rolls , pho , and a beef dish that were all cheap -lrb- i think it 's the worst when pho is $ 7 + -rrb- . 
4		great locally owned theater , in a formerly at-risk area . <sssss> this harkins location is outstanding . <sssss> it is nothing to open a new , shiny theater , but to keep it maintained in tip top shape , and really care ? <sssss> now that is something special , and that is what you get at this theater . <sssss> if you can remember waaay back when to the old christown theater , where you had to bring a gun and knife to safely enter and exit , you will be happy to know that things have changed greatly . <sssss> both the theater and parking lot are safe , clean , and well lit . <sssss> much like there are elvis vs. beatles people , there are harkins vs. amc people . <sssss> personally , i do n't think it is even a close race . <sssss> harkins offers souvenir drink cups you can buy , and the whole year , refills are only $ 1 . <sssss> additionally , you can purchase a large popcorn , and you get one free refill . <sssss> so you can buy a large popcorn and save the bag , bring it back your next visit and get a free refill , and then spend a buck getting a large drink . <sssss> you simply can not beat that deal , and for me , in addition to better chairs which rock , harkins can not be beat . <sssss> also , check with your employer 's hr dept. many have discounted tickets for sale , where you can get tickets for $ 6 , what a deal ! <sssss> cheers . 
4		talk about good food ! <sssss> i first tried espo 's back in april 2006 , i had just moved here and was tired from unpacking so i ventured out and came across -lrb- almost missed it though , it can be a bit hard to spot -rrb- espo 's , decided to stop in because the little mom n pop hole in the wall places always have good food . <sssss> i 've been continuing to eat here for the last seven years . <sssss> sure , it 's decorated a little cheesy and it 's the kind of place that , sometimes i think , i probably do n't want to know how -lrb- un -rrb- clean the kitchen is , but damn is it good food . <sssss> i 've never been disappointed with anything i 've ordered there and will continue to go and recommend it to my friends looking for good , authentic , mexican food . 
4		great fish , great prices , awesome service ! <sssss> they have a great outdoor patio . <sssss> so many choices now in gilbert , you will not be disappointed with takara . <sssss> some of our favorites : spicy tuna salad , spicy salmon skin hand roll & jennifer roll . <sssss> large beers to go with sushi only $ 2.99 . <sssss> very few places -lrb- trust me , we go to all of them -rrb- offer the quality they have here . <sssss> the way the owner puts these rolls together is incredible . <sssss> the attention to detail of every single plate that comes out is amazing . 
4		it 's funny to think that some dough , a little bit of tomato sauce and a few scattered ingredients has our country obsessed with pizza . <sssss> estimates say that the pizza industry is worth somewhere around $ 30 billion dollars annually with over 60,000 pizzerias in the u.s. alone . <sssss> better get on that treadmill because each one of us apparently consumes around 23 pounds of pizza per year . <sssss> who says were the chubbiest nation ? <sssss> with those staggering numbers it 's no surprise we have so many pizza joints vying for their piece of the pie . <sssss> if you have any doubt , just go to famed pizzeria bianco on pretty much any night of the week they 're open and expect a 2 hour wait minimum , obsession , oh yeah . <sssss> over the past few years i 've chowed down on slices from the parlor in phoenix , liberty market in gilbert and now my latest favorite la bocca urban pizzeria in tempe . <sssss> situated along bustling mill avenue , like it 's namesake , la bocca exudes hip-urban-cool without being pretentious or douchey . <sssss> outside lb there 's a spacious patio that 's perfect for sipping wine and watching the hunky college boys and girls saunter by . <sssss> inside the space is modern , dark and relaxed with low key music playing in the background and old foreign films projecting on the back wall . <sssss> if you can , call ahead and reserve the orange banquette by the kitchen , probably the most comfortable seat in the house . <sssss> bruschetta planks -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- come 4 in an order , but with so many outstanding choices it 's hard to choose . <sssss> smoked prosciutto , fig , mascarpone cheese and truffle oil was balanced with salty and sweet , but left me wanting more . <sssss> pulled pork , housemade pesto and roasted red pepper was on the bland side , though the roasted garlic , goat cheese , arugula and balsamic popped with flavor and texture . <sssss> i 'd also suggest the smoked sockeye salmon with capers and chef 's tartar sauce , reminded me of a dinner version of lox and bagels . <sssss> another great way to start might be with the med plate -lrb- $ 14 -rrb- . <sssss> this is a huge plate filled with basil hummus , babaganoush , warm feta cheese , roasted peppers , queen creek olives , artisan toast , and house made flat bread . <sssss> the consistency of the hummus was a little thick for my taste but still quite good paired with the creamy feta and salty olives . <sssss> i was actually surprised as to how good the pizza really is here . <sssss> the first taste of the bocca trio -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- revealed with high quality ingredients and charred chewy crust . <sssss> topped with crushed san marzano tomatoes , pepperoni , salami , schreiner 's `` sicilian '' sausage , mozzarella , fontina and olives lb 's gas fired oven does an amazing job of caramelizing these toppings into a smoky and slightly sweet mouth parade . <sssss> there are 7 pizzas to choose from but if you do n't see something that suits your fancy , build your own pizza -lrb- $ 8 -rrb- or calzone -lrb- $ 9 -rrb- . <sssss> at a $ 1 - $ 3 each , toppings can add up really fast so select wisely from their 30 or so choices . <sssss> the only issue i have with la bocca is that i did n't visit sooner . 
4		i have always liked joe 's crab shack . <sssss> they have a great happy hour from 4-7pm half off all appetizers and great drink specials . 
4		dillards , at the fashion square mall in scottsdale , is one of the anchor stores in this busy shopping mecca . <sssss> their men 's store is well stocked with all of the latest fashions . <sssss> the polo shop is always a good place to begin a browsing session . <sssss> the scottsdale fashion square mall has a reputation as being one of the premier shopping venues in the southwest . <sssss> stop in ... you wo n't be disappointed . 
4		not bad at all , kind of dark inside ... would make for a solid date place . <sssss> a bit overpriced but the meals are large . <sssss> only downside was the side dishes , you only get one choice then it 's al la cart for $ 5 a piece . <sssss> around the table we had the salmon and trout , both good . <sssss> the ribeye was unique with a pineapple/citrus flavor , i liked it . <sssss> ordered a kiltlifter and was only chared $ 2.50 so that was awesome , for not even sitting at the bar . <sssss> would go to this place atleast once or twice a month . 
4		it is a fun park . <sssss> playful dogs , friendly peolpe , and pretty well kept ! <sssss> my sister and i took our dogs there twice so far and we love it !! <sssss> there are a few fun obstacles that are fun to watch my dog do . <sssss> there is some areas with quite a bit of mud , but other than that it was fun !! <sssss> i would definitely recommended it ! 
4		we eat at frank & lupe 's old mexico frequently . <sssss> the service is occasionally slow but always friendly and laid back . <sssss> the ambiance is like mexico with personality in an vintage scottsdale building . <sssss> the chips & salsa are home made , chili 's from new mexico . <sssss> it 's a family deal . <sssss> this is n't a fast food mexican shop . <sssss> it 's excellent , moderately priced , family style new mexico mexican food . <sssss> the patio is way cool and fun when the days are warm . <sssss> kick back with a margarita and enjoy . 
4		a quality location that has everything on needs in a convinience store except gasoline . <sssss> employees are friendy and they have a big liquor selection . 
4		my girlfriend and i met here for lunch last week . <sssss> she lives in the west valley and i 'm in the faaaar northeast valley . <sssss> i 've been wanting to go to gallo blanco for a while , so this seemed like a great place to meet halfway . <sssss> the restaurant is really cute and chill as far as atmosphere . <sssss> the entrance is a bit confusing as far as where you go to get sat , though . <sssss> we had early lunch , and i had n't had breakfast , so i was thrilled that they had breakfast all day ! <sssss> i had the steak and eggs , which i shared with my son , so i had to have all the sauces on the side :o-lrb- next time i go , i will have the sauces on the plate because they were yummy . <sssss> my breakfast was well-prepared , tasty , and nicely plated . <sssss> portion size was perfect . <sssss> it was a quick lunch and i was more focused on catching up with my girlfriend than i was with the food . <sssss> i plan to go again and take it in a bit more . <sssss> i have a feeling i 'll be updating to 5 stars : o -rrb- 
4		this place is a pretty decent restaurant/brewery . <sssss> the food was on the upper end of good , and there was a lot of it that sounded tasty that i did n't get a chance to try . <sssss> the real reason , for me anyway , to come to a brewing company is to try their beer though . <sssss> their lineup is relatively extensive including all the regular types of brew from ipa to stouts . <sssss> what you should do if you 're really looking for something special though is ask about their seasonals or unique beers . <sssss> they have some great ones in casks and off their main tasting platter depending on when you go . <sssss> also , definitely get the oatmeal stout milkshake for dessert ... even if you do n't like oatmeal stout beers you 'll enjoy this treat . 
4		i had a really , really , really good time here ! <sssss> the staff is fantastic ! <sssss> since centurion is such a small place , you 're probably going to wind up talking to the people around you ... staff and fellow patron alike . <sssss> i love that kind of atmosphere . <sssss> everyone was in a great mood , and it was n't that `` i 'm in public , better put on a smile '' kind of great mood either , it was genuine . <sssss> be prepared for flavors that will make your mouth feel alive ! <sssss> i 'm talking about goat cheese , blueberry balsamic reduction , crab meat , truffle oil , lemon zest , manchego and chorizo ! <sssss> if you enjoy bland flavors , looks elsewhere . <sssss> my date and i had a sampler of sorts . <sssss> we got the strudel , a pizza and an order of risotto to share . <sssss> the strudel was loaded with goat cheese , spinach and mushrooms . <sssss> it was served on a bed of cabbage , corn and crab meat . <sssss> we 're not finished there though because they added a blueberry balsamic reduction on top of it all and seriously took a great dish and made it even better ! <sssss> while getting giddy after each bite of that , we also got to eat some of the risotto -- cheesy manchego risotto topped with a generous scoop of chorizo . <sssss> mmm ! <sssss> we finished it rather quickly ... and then , there was pizza ! <sssss> we had the salami and artichoke pizza . <sssss> what they do n't tell you on the menu is that the artichokes are marinaded in truffle oil and lemon zest . <sssss> whenever i got a bite with every ingredient on it ... bliss ensued . <sssss> it was n't the best pizza i 've ever had , but it was damn good . <sssss> i do n't really need to wrap this up any other way . <sssss> i ca n't wait to go back ! 
4		been here a couple times now and have to say i really like this place . <sssss> not because the fish quality is amazing or the rolls are great but because it goes everything well . <sssss> nothing is really outstanding but the price and the rest is just solid for a $ 20 price you get miso soup , salad , edamame , choice or tempura or gyoza , ice cream and all you can eat sushi . <sssss> that is a great deal and the sushi list is huge featuring a ton of specialty rolls and nigiri . <sssss> i have never left this place not feeling like i got more than my moneys worth even on nights where i ate light . <sssss> as for the food like i said it is solid but not spectacular . <sssss> the fish is n't bad but is n't out of this world either . <sssss> it 's just good . <sssss> unlike some other ayce places i am not afraid to try things on the menu here and venture out and i am a bit of a fish snob and wo n't do that unless i feel comfortable with the level of quality at a place . <sssss> i have found some things i am not a fan of her but nothing i felt was bad quality or stale . <sssss> i am a big fan of a few of the specialty rolls who 's name escapes me but i think it 's the mido roll and the ahha roll . <sssss> also i like there spicy scallop which i do n't like most places . <sssss> the services is also good here and the place is clean . <sssss> you really are n't going to go wrong for the price and really worth the try . <sssss> only reason i withhold a 5th star is because the fish is just average and at a sushi place that is my key grade . <sssss> of the ayce places around though this one is a solid pick . 
4		*** from the pancakes to the breakfast burrito and the chilaquiles , gallo blanco serves a good and very reasonably priced breakfast in a warm , casual and friendly atmosphere *** gallo blanco cafe & bar is located in a hotel -lrb- clarendon hotel -rrb- . <sssss> hotel restaurants worry me a little . <sssss> but once you enter gallo blanco , you realize that gallo blanco is not your typical hotel restaurant and clarendon hotel is definitely not your typical hotel . <sssss> the clarendon hotel seemed to have a funky boutique vibe to it . <sssss> the front desk seemed very casual and the little bit we saw of the hotel was fresh , casual and youthful . <sssss> there was a lot of interesting looking local art in the hallway and the men 's restrooms were outfitted with urinals that were designed to look like open mouths -lrb- a yelper posted a photo of it on gallo blanco 's page -rrb- . <sssss> the gallo blanco has a very youthful coffee shop feel to it . <sssss> the restaurant is open and bright -lrb- big floor-to-ceiling windows -rrb- . <sssss> the restaurant is very straightforward . <sssss> square room . <sssss> not much in terms of decoration -lrb- some art here and there -rrb- . <sssss> bright but not overly strong colors that give it a casual and hip atmosphere . <sssss> the seating is very functional too -lrb- no frills -rrb- . <sssss> there is also an outdoor patio . <sssss> we went for breakfast and it was reasonably priced . <sssss> most of their breakfast items were $ 7 to $ 10 and the portion sizes were just right -lrb- generous enough but not over-the-top-big -rrb- . <sssss> we shared the breakfast burrito , which actually was pretty big . <sssss> the burrito was a flour tortilla stuffed with chorizo , potatoes , eggs , refried beans , cheddar cheese , and fire roasted salsa . <sssss> the burrito was flavorful and had a little bit of spice and kick to it -lrb- additional salsa was available on the side -rrb- . <sssss> everything tasted good and all the ingredients were nicely melted together . <sssss> the chilaquiles verdes were even better . <sssss> the tostadas were light and crispy ; they were also flavored quite well with the green chile sauce . <sssss> we added some shredded chicken and it was good and tender -lrb- and not too dry -rrb- . <sssss> the chilaquiles verdes were topped with some good sunny side up eggs . <sssss> for something a little sweet , we went with their buttermilk pancakes and they were very good . <sssss> the pancakes were light and fluffy . <sssss> they also had a great brown color to them . <sssss> you get that fresh off the griddle flavor here that you do n't get at a lot of pancake places . <sssss> the maple syrup was warm , sweet and good . <sssss> i also had the fresh squeezed orange juice and it was pulpy and tasty . <sssss> service started off a little slow , but once we got our order in , the food came out very quickly and the staff was attentive . <sssss> the whole staff -lrb- from the owner to the hostess to the waitresses -rrb- were very friendly and personable , which added to the warm and casual atmosphere . <sssss> gallo blanco cafe & bar serves a good mexican breakfast . <sssss> all three of our dishes were good , which makes me curious about their other options . <sssss> i do not know when i will be in phoenix next , but my breakfast was good enough here that i would consider making a return visit -lrb- even if i was only in phoenix for a day or two -rrb- . <sssss> parking is available on the street -lrb- free ; no meters -rrb- . 
4		i dragged my friends around on foot to find this place staffed by hipsters making good coffee and good crepes . <sssss> i 'm sure they , like i , thought that walk was worth it . 
4		great place for sushi and fast , friendly service . <sssss> sushi was fresh and delicious , only downside was that some of the tuna was a bit tough ! 
4		1st time here in a few years . <sssss> had a great experience . <sssss> our table had tacos , burrito , and a torta w / fries . <sssss> the carne asada and fish were great . <sssss> friendly staff , good beer selection , and good prices . <sssss> excited to come back here on a weeknight for festivities . <sssss> ps a lot of tables had a side order of beans , so they must be great ! 
4		chef matt carter , already known for zinc bistro and the year-old the mission restaurant , is getting a lot of buzz for his latest venture , nine 05 . <sssss> named for its location at 905 n. fourth st. , the asian restaurant occupies the former home of fate . <sssss> carter and his team have completely changed and modernized the venue into an ultra-cool hip modern space . <sssss> the outdoor bar is great , and it comes with a weekend night dj . <sssss> the dining space outside is fairly large and can accommodate decent sized parties . <sssss> with the cooler weather coming , this will be a good place to hang out for a drink and a bite . <sssss> service at nine 05 is what i like to call triple a : amazing , attentive and attractive . <sssss> during two visits , my party felt so welcomed and taken care of , we almost wanted to take off our shoes and stay longer . <sssss> on my second visit , manager jennifer mara even remembered my favorite beer from my first visit , xingu -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- . <sssss> it 's this kind of attention that shows in the service and every aspect of the experience , including the well planned menu . <sssss> plate presentations are some of the prettiest i 've seen in quite some time . <sssss> during both occasions we shared appetizers , then each ordered an entree , which can be shared family style . <sssss> portions are generous , and the chef does a fantastic job keeping things from getting too heavy . <sssss> the crisp , clean flavors of the cucumber salad -lrb- $ 8 -rrb- was a great way to get things moving . <sssss> the bright and light octopus sashimi -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- had a wonderful flavor from the pickled chilies , more sweet than spicy , yet balanced , though the octopus was a little on the chewy side . <sssss> fried items were piping hot , starting with the tomato katsu -lrb- $ 9 -rrb- , which was lightly breaded and nicely crisp . <sssss> beware of that first bite , these were hot , hot , hot ! <sssss> the heirloom tomato was nice and ripe resulting in deeply satisfying flavors . <sssss> the rice cakes -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- had a nice crunch , but these were really to show off the tasty cilantro-lime coconut yogurt drizzled onto the plate . <sssss> if i had a bowl of that yogurt i would have dipped everything into it . <sssss> good stuff ! <sssss> duck and foie dumplings -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- were good , but i wish the foie flavor would have been more pronounced . <sssss> it 's a personal taste . <sssss> the korean chicken wings -lrb- $ 8 -rrb- were tender , crispy , meaty and interesting with the topping of chili threads . <sssss> i 've actually never had a chili thread before , so small and thin but wow , what a flavor explosion ! <sssss> entrees were a blast , beginning with n ample bowl of red curry mussels -lrb- $ 18 -rrb- . <sssss> these plump bad boys were made for the fragrant coconut and lemongrass curry broth . <sssss> the chef also piles on thick slices of bread so as not to waste even a single drop of the complex elixir . <sssss> eating the pork belly fried rice -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- was a pleasure , savoring each bite of tender hog and sweet spiked caramelized pineapple . <sssss> i asked for a side of their pickled chilies to add a spicy sweet dimension to the tender rice . <sssss> be sure to use the chilies also on the tonkotsu ramen -lrb- $ 15 -rrb- . <sssss> a huge steaming bowl of richly flavored broth and noodles topped with pork belly , scallions and an egg . <sssss> you know how i get when there is egg yolk involved , the flavor just drives me wild , while it adds a certain richness to just about any dish . <sssss> desserts -lrb- $ 7 each -rrb- are limited to only a few thoughtful selections . <sssss> the blueberry mochi cake was moist and chewy , adorned with fresh berries and a scoop of lychee sorbet was refreshing . <sssss> however , i would have preferred a different flavor of sorbet , since i 'm one of those few people who think lychee tastes like soap . <sssss> it 's just a preference . <sssss> the coffee and chocolate torte was more my style . <sssss> with its fudge-like texture and smooth and flavorful chai ice cream , it 's real winner . <sssss> with great attention to detail , delicious food and a superb staff , i think you will find plenty to be happy about after a visit here . <sssss> on my way out i could n't help but think of an excuse to come back , then i was told that the lunch menu is outstanding . <sssss> what a perfect reason . 
4		the food was amazing . <sssss> we had a very large party so everyone had a variety of things and all raved . <sssss> the portions were huge , which you do n't always see in such a nice , upscale place . <sssss> the only complaint was the the wine was not flowing . <sssss> we had to ask for refills or be stranded empty for a while . <sssss> their loss , we would have bought as much as they can push . 
4		i am a fan for happy hours here ! <sssss> 1/2 price appetizers and $ 4.5 house margarita . <sssss> they have it everyday from 3pm - 7pm . <sssss> they do have a limited selection of draft beer so check if they have your beer . 
4		superstition springs is good , but not great . <sssss> grass is plentiful here , so it 's not a desert course by any means . <sssss> there are plenty of water hazards to go around , so bring lots of balls . <sssss> the course was really in pretty good shape . <sssss> i like the layout . <sssss> there are a few minor elevation changes , and some opportunities to carry -lrb- or lose your ball , in my case -rrb- over water . <sssss> there is even a running creek between holes 10 and 18 that is sure to leap up and grab your ball . <sssss> on two holes , there is water on either side of the fairway , so straight shots are generally rewarded at s.s. . <sssss> the only problem is the price . <sssss> superstition springs is almost always overpriced , running at over $ 100 in the winter , and $ 40 - $ 50 -lrb- if you include range balls -rrb- in the summer . <sssss> for that price , you might as well play a much nicer course like las sendas five miles up the road . <sssss> it might be good for an afternoon twilight round during the summer , but at their normal rates , it 's not a good value . 
4		i had a hard time deciding on what to buy here . <sssss> i mean , i just wanted it all - panties with ruffles on the bottoms , pasties with tassels , a fishnet full body suit , knee high patent pleather boots , corsets , a french maid costume , garter belts , stockings with lace at the top of the thigh , a paddle and a whip - i 'm getting carried away . <sssss> lingerie superstore has a great selection , it 's a little on the pricey side , i 've bought some of their stuff through online websites for less money . <sssss> the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful . <sssss> i 've been back several times and always received awesome service . 
4		i really like this target . <sssss> it 's close to my work and easy to get in and get out . <sssss> the parking lot is rather large and i almost always find a really good parking space . <sssss> the inside of the store is nice as well . <sssss> everything is clean and the place is well lit . <sssss> the aisles are laid out nicely and easy to find items . <sssss> i love stopping here on a lunch break to get my necessities or just to browse . <sssss> i like searching the clearance end caps because they usually have some good stuff . <sssss> overall , i 'd rather shop at target than wal * mart and this is a pretty nice target . <sssss> it 's got everything a traditional target has , plus a grocery market and a starbucks inside . 
4		on valentines night . <sssss> . <sssss> mark took me here . <sssss> . <sssss> i always associate italian ... and good . <sssss> . <sssss> no great . <sssss> . <sssss> italian food . <sssss> . <sssss> authentic . <sssss> . <sssss> that is . <sssss> . <sssss> with love :--rrb- . <sssss> . <sssss> and aiellos delivered . <sssss> . <sssss> and so did mark . <sssss> . <sssss> very friendly family run restaurant . <sssss> . <sssss> i ordered a tre colored salad . <sssss> . <sssss> the vinagrette was just as i like it . <sssss> . <sssss> the bread was perfect . <sssss> . <sssss> my chicken parmigiana was huge . <sssss> . <sssss> and my plate runneth over with chicken . <sssss> . <sssss> there could have been a bit more pasta . <sssss> . <sssss> but thats okay ... mark had veal piccata . <sssss> . <sssss> he had some serious order envy ... his was good too . <sssss> . <sssss> we ordered a bottle of the sangiovese . <sssss> . <sssss> and polished it . <sssss> . <sssss> it was one of the best wines ive had in a restaurant . <sssss> . <sssss> considering some of the best italian food i had was in manhattan -lrb- ny -rrb- . <sssss> . <sssss> near the theatre district . <sssss> . <sssss> i was seriously impressed with the wine . <sssss> . <sssss> to finish we shared a zabliogne . <sssss> . <sssss> a italian custard with berries . <sssss> . <sssss> ive attempted to make this classic italian dessert at home for a dinner party and failed ... that could have had some more berries , but again . <sssss> . <sssss> its rare to see on a menu here at all ! <sssss> i loved that the owner walked the restaurant with a game of bingo . <sssss> . <sssss> you guess a number between one and ninety . <sssss> . <sssss> and you could win dinner :--rrb- seriously . <sssss> . <sssss> im overall impressed . <sssss> . 
4		i have n't been to this red robin in a while , and i came back with a friend of mine this afternoon to meet up for some food . <sssss> what a good time ! <sssss> it was busy for a sunday afternoon , but fortunately we did n't have to wait . <sssss> we were seated in the bar area and our server greeted us promptly . <sssss> we already had the menu 's at our table , and after scouring it , i went with the fries . <sssss> my friend went with a chicken salad , and i her sister went with the fish and chips . <sssss> overall , our food was tasty , and i really had a good time . <sssss> while we were busy gabbing , our server always refilled our drinks , and after i bill came we had our bill split . <sssss> she was friendly and nice , and i really enjoyed our time here . <sssss> i will say , the handicapped bathroom was out of service when i was there , and it was a bit messy and needed attention overall . <sssss> nothing horrendous , but could have used someone to go in there and clean up the towels on the floor and mop some . <sssss> overall a positive experience and i had a good time . <sssss> will be back when i 'm in the area again ! <sssss> oh , and happy hour all sunday long ! 
4		it 's a great place to go when you do n't want to deal with the typical old town scene . <sssss> they have big buck hunter and other awesome games . <sssss> everyone is friendly 
4		`` i do n't eat fast food . '' <sssss> pfft ! <sssss> nope , that 's a lie . <sssss> in-n-out is fast and i 'm sticking to it . <sssss> in-n-out does n't feel like a bad thing to do . <sssss> -lrb- and it * was * super fast ! -rrb- <sssss> had this heavenly goodness for the first time recently . <sssss> i almost keeled over in delight while sampling the fries . <sssss> goodness gracious . <sssss> why has no one told me about this place before ? <sssss> all french fries should taste like this ! <sssss> i 'll never have a fry again elsewhere . <sssss> why bother ? <sssss> these are the best kind . <sssss> light , crispy but not too crunchy . <sssss> it did n't feel like grease was involved in frying them . <sssss> but the pure vegetable oil i later learned that is used . <sssss> delightful . <sssss> i still ca n't believe it . <sssss> i was cheated growing up eating the mushy drive thru fries of other chains as a child . <sssss> -lrb- thanks mom ! -rrb- <sssss> i 'll save this special treat for special indulgences . <sssss> totally worth it . <sssss> loved it ! <sssss> other stuff + the quality of sound during drive thru order process was crisp/clear . <sssss> + staff was super polite , easy to understand . <sssss> + staff was helpful . <sssss> cheery ! <sssss> -lrb- nye 11:15 pm -rrb- 
4		we frequent this restaurant regularly because it is close to home and always meets our expectations . <sssss> the food is always great and reasonably priced . <sssss> the staff is also very friendly . <sssss> we eat in the bar sometimes because the wine is 2 bucks cheaper per glass . <sssss> we really like this particular macaroni grill at desert ridge . 
4		this is the first time trying this place and i have to say ... great food ! <sssss> this definitely a due over for the family . <sssss> the pad thai has great flavor i would recommended this dish to everyone . <sssss> let me start out by saying thai places are not created equally . <sssss> this has set the bar to a whole new level . <sssss> i am giving it 4 stars . <sssss> the only reason for that is because i just had wished that the waiter would come check on us a little more often to see if we needed water or what not . 
4		i 'm not even vegitarian and i dig this place . <sssss> went there with a friend and was pleasently suprised . <sssss> the ice cream is great ! <sssss> cool vibe . 
4		it 's deliciousness every time i come here . <sssss> i ordered the chicken satay which came with the tastiest cucumber salad . <sssss> i had to order another cucumber salad it was so good . <sssss> it was only $ 2 extra . <sssss> they give you six skewers of chicken , so its more than enough for a meal . <sssss> the thai iced tea is so sweet and refreshing . 
4		i 'm not a huge pecan pie fan , but i had to try the jack daniel 's pecan pie because our tour guide recommended it on the way back from sedona . <sssss> it was sweet but not excessively sweet like many pecan pies . <sssss> although the jack daniel 's flavor is n't obvious , there 's a richness to this pie that is so different probably attributed to the jd . <sssss> the crust had delicate crunch and was yummy . <sssss> when i ate the last bite , i wished i bought the larger than average whole pie instead of just a slice . <sssss> i would have devoured every bit of it since it was that good . <sssss> there were many pies to choose from . <sssss> service could have been better . <sssss> there were several of us in line for a slice of pie . <sssss> there was n't anyone readily available to help us . <sssss> the cashier line also moved slow . <sssss> although the service was slow , the staff was very nice . <sssss> 5 star pie + 3 star service = 4 star average . 
4		i have n't had a chance to eat in yet but i did get to try their tikka masala chicken salad and it was good . <sssss> we got it for a work meeting . <sssss> i loved the dressing with it but the salad was somewhat lacking . <sssss> the chicken was great but the veggies in the salad were n't as plentiful as i had hoped . <sssss> everyone else 's food looked great and it made me wish i could have a pasty -lrb- dang gluten ! -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> i would suggest checking this place out as it has probably the only english food i 've seen in tempe . 
4		5 stars for service ... our waiter on a slow tuesday afternoon , right after the lunch rush , was a funny guy and pretty good at his job . <sssss> as well , my friend and i never wanted for refills on our dr. pepper , which is the one true way to my heart at any restaurant . <sssss> 3 stars for the food , which frankly , was n't all that great but that may have been due to what i ordered more than anything else -lrb- blue moon burger -rrb- . <sssss> to be honest , i 've had better cheeseburgers from denny 's -lrb- see my review , lol -rrb- but i guess that is n't the draw here ... my friend 's beef brisket sandwich looked and smelled delicious and there 's plenty more items on the menu to choose from next time . <sssss> of course , i must reiterate that since there is n't much in the way of decent dining in the neighborhood my friend and i work in -lrb- she about 5 blocks west , myself about 3 -rrb- , this place will definitely get a second chance not too long from now . 
4		yeah ! <sssss> joe 's farm grill !!! <sssss> i like smaller portions , so the kids meal is perfect for me . <sssss> i get the chicken strips , which come with french fries . <sssss> my husband likes the fontina burger and sweet potato fries . <sssss> the drink and condiment station outside is pretty cool too . <sssss> my favorite part ? <sssss> the bathroom ! <sssss> i know it sounds weird , but check it out . <sssss> it has a tv mounted in the wall that plays vintage puppet movies , and framed barbie and g.i. joe dolls . <sssss> again , weird in description ... but cool in real life ! 
4		surprisingly good food . <sssss> usually sports bars have mediocre food , but both my boyfriend and i thought this was a step above . <sssss> the greco-roman was delish although it was more like a greco-mexican , haha . <sssss> good nonethless . <sssss> the boneless wings were also good . <sssss> not a huge fan of the grilled cheese , there was too much bread and not the greatest combo of cheeses . <sssss> they offer a lot of drink specials throughout the week . <sssss> the decor was `` eh '' . <sssss> not great but not bad . <sssss> but it 's cool that they have nice pool tables and a lot of tvs . <sssss> will definitely go back ! 
4		drove by a thousand times . <sssss> stopped in today , and most likely tomorrow . <sssss> never have been to a thai basil before , which is strange because i do absolutely love thai cuisine . <sssss> stopped in last night with my girlfriend for a dinner break from studying . <sssss> just wanted a quick bite to eat and got much more . <sssss> the menu was large and honestly hard to choose from . <sssss> after several minutes trying to decide on a choice , i struck up a conversation with a friendly patron to my right and she recommended the egg noodle stir fry with chicken . <sssss> trusting her , i ordered it and within 5 minutes i had a large , hot plate of it sitting in front of me . <sssss> at the same time my girl landed herself some fried sweet potato skins with a delicious dipping sauce . <sssss> both of use enjoyed every last bite of the meal . <sssss> we topped off the dinner break with what else for a college student on a study break ?!? <sssss> the thai coffee . <sssss> it is served iced and taste somewhere between chocolate milk , and burned coffee . <sssss> sound kinda weird ? <sssss> well it kinda took me by surprise , but we enjoyed every last drop . <sssss> since this wonderful , new found basil explosion is so close and i will definitely be back soon . <sssss> maybe tomorrow ... btw ... i heart basil 
4		4 stars based on the tastes of the cupcakes . <sssss> we went today because i got a coupon for a free cupcake from 104.7 for my bday . <sssss> i do n't get why these places are charging $ 3.50 for 1 cupcake , they are good but not that good ... and also do n't get why they use so much frosting . <sssss> the cream cheese frosting that was on the princess one and the frosting that was on the birthday surprise were really good and not overly sweet but there was way too much . <sssss> cute little place but probably wo n't go back seeing as i can make the same thing for a lot less . 
4		wow if you want to go to a western restaurant that serves excellent food with a gorgeous scenery , this is the place . <sssss> everywhere you look there was eye candy ! <sssss> there are tons of rattlesnake souvenir 's to purchase , the slide was a lot of fun going down -lrb- the menu tells you why they had one -- it was used as an escape route back in the days -rrb- , the lights used pans , they used jars for cups , people dressed up , a band , your appetizer plate was a small aluminum plate , etc , and etc. . <sssss> it was fantastic ! <sssss> :d this place is pricy and reservations are highly recommended at a weekend night . <sssss> the rattlesnake appetizer was good . <sssss> with the cucumber sauce , it . <sssss> . <sssss> tastes . <sssss> . <sssss> like ... chicken , lol . <sssss> but i was brave and i tried it and i liked it !! <sssss> i highly recommend coming here for the experience and to try rattlesnake !! <sssss> :-rrb- one side comment , the bull outside the restaurant needs a friend . <sssss> i think he 's lonely . 
4		i really liked visiting bookmans . <sssss> . <sssss> crazily enough , i 've never been here before ! <sssss> i enjoyed their store and cafe , though i was disappointed that their cafe employees totally forgot about my latte :-lrb- . <sssss> no big deal , but hopefully when i return again , this is n't repeated . <sssss> the cafe is great for just chilling with a book and a drink/sandwich , or surfing on your laptop , or , like us : great for boardgames ! <sssss> they have a vast selection of things at this place - vhs , dvds , books , cds , board games , video games . <sssss> . <sssss> the list goes on ! <sssss> i would shop here just to get away from the big-box stores like b&n , etc. . 
4		the chicken boti kebab is phenomenal -- the chicken is tender and full of flavor , and it is served with great pickled onions and a delicious green sauce . 
4		service is good but the food is really good . <sssss> if you are looking for something authentic and you want something different than the usual panda express and peiwei this is the place to come . <sssss> the orange chicken its cooked different from any other place i 've ever been and its really good . <sssss> i have n't tried a dish that i did n't like . <sssss> order the dinner for two and you will be very pleased . <sssss> fried rice soup its great too . 
4		the bobbie is the best sandwich . <sssss> that 's all you need to know ... i just wish the parking situation was n't so shitty for this place . <sssss> meh . 
4		yum . <sssss> i like rudy 's . <sssss> i used to eat at rudy 's when i lived in albuquerque . <sssss> my favorite meal was smoked turkey and the butter drenched potatoes and it is here in chandler too . <sssss> the turkey is tender and a bit smoky , potatoes are perfect and very buttery . <sssss> my only complaint is the turkey was excessively salty ! <sssss> so much so that i thought it was just a bad night and we went back the very next day . <sssss> yep , the very next day . <sssss> let 's talk about the atmosphere first . <sssss> you park in the parking lot and take a deep breath of smoking meat goodness . <sssss> you walk in and typically get welcomed by someone in the gift shop/country store . <sssss> then go stand in line around troughs of drinks , soda and beers , pass by a big fridge full of desserts in small containers . <sssss> they have many cash registers so the long line will go fast , order off the board , all the typical meats , sides , and green chile stew ! <sssss> get the stew or you will be sad , it is like straight from nm . <sssss> the real deal . <sssss> they take your order people in line behind the registers are cutting , slicing , chopping your meat fresh and weighing it out . <sssss> if you order potatoes they may ask with butter ? <sssss> um , hell ya . <sssss> drown 'em . <sssss> do you want sliced white bread ? <sssss> not me but maybe you do . <sssss> pay and stop at the bar for peppers , sauces , napkins , utensils and paper to put down on your table . <sssss> go find a big picnic table to sit on , spread out your paper and dig in . <sssss> two sauces on the table , regular with a little bite , and one with a big bite . <sssss> we tried it all the second visit and enjoyed everything but the turkey was still very , very salty . <sssss> i loved the green chile stew and will be back for that but given the choice between famous dave 's and rudy 's - i would probably choose dave 's . <sssss> maybe it 's the atmosphere as rudy 's is a bit of work , plastic utensils , no plates and no price break . 
4		not so impressed because of the food , though it is good . <sssss> i was more impressed by the service . <sssss> two people had told me how long the wait was on any given night . <sssss> i heard stories about 2-3 hours . <sssss> so i had a backup plan just in case . <sssss> fortunately , we did n't wait anywhere near that long on this friday night . <sssss> we simply walked up , were greeted and sat down immediately . <sssss> awesome . <sssss> first thing i notice is this magnificent brick oven . <sssss> i 'm figuring the pizza must be amazing . <sssss> my marguerita pizza with mushrooms was very good , but did n't knock my socks off . <sssss> my friend got the rosa and really liked it . <sssss> service was very good . <sssss> best service was the guy greeting you at the door . <sssss> great attitude and seemed to genuinely enjoy meeting people . <sssss> i offered to buy him an ice cream because it was so hot outside . <sssss> he politely turned that down but appreciated it . <sssss> i think next time i am downtown i will definitely return . 
4		lee 's is a terrific and authentic vietnamese banh mi -lrb- sandwich -rrb- shop located across the street from lee lee market at the corner of warner and dobson . <sssss> they 've got a bunch of stuff on the menu but i always order the same thing , the # 11 special which runs a whopping $ 3.15 . <sssss> you get a very fresh foot long baguette with a few slices of processed pork and lots of fresh vegies and cilantro . <sssss> it 's quick , delicious and refreshing . <sssss> it 's a cleaned up version of pretty much any hanoi banh mi joint , which is to say , it 's just fine . 
4		prompt , friendly , and error-free service . <sssss> this my work dress pants second home-ha ! <sssss> i hate ironing/pressing my business casual pants for work , so i bring to park avenue . <sssss> they always have my garments ready when promised ; one time they had miscounted and i had brought more than what i was charged for , and they ate the difference and did not charge me . <sssss> this is a prepaid so , no putting your clothes on holiday here . <sssss> i get discount emails from them . <sssss> my only irritation is that when you use debit they have a surcharge , but you can avoid that by paying cash . <sssss> they also have a referral program 
4		we popped in here for a brew while walking around heritage square . <sssss> the waitstaff is very friendly and attentive . <sssss> note : if you just want a brew - you can order it inside ! <sssss> we went with a local hefe and it was great ! <sssss> the options for noshing look great , but we were headed for dinner so we did n't get a chance to try them out ! <sssss> see you there soon ! 
4		tempe butte , also known as `` a '' mountain , is located next to sun devil stadium and is accessible from either rio salado , veterans way or mill ave. while it does n't take as long to walk/hike up as camelback or piestewa , it is nothing to scoff at . <sssss> my husband and i quickly found out when we ventured over to `` a '' mountain a few weekends ago how deceiving it was ! <sssss> the walk up is pretty steep and will give your legs a great workout . <sssss> at the steepest point , there are handrails to hold onto if you need them . <sssss> there are two areas along the way to/from the summit with benches where you can stop and rest or just sit to enjoy the view . <sssss> off to the left before you get to the top , there is an area where you can sit on rocks to reflect , eat a snack , or rest before heading back down . <sssss> along the way up and at the top , there are nice views of tempe and downtown phoenix , but not as spectacular as the ones you can find at the summits of camelback or piestewa . <sssss> `` a '' mountain seems popular with walkers/runners who make a few trips up and down the trails to get an extra good workout in . <sssss> it 's also a good place to bring a dog for a walk -lrb- sophie quite enjoyed herself when we took her -rrb- and there are doggy bags conveniently located at the trailheads . <sssss> parking is easy and there are a few light rail stations nearby . 
4		this place always smells so good walking by ! <sssss> bath & body works is my go to gift spot when i do n't know what to get someone . <sssss> by someone i mean a woman , what girl does n't love yummy scented bath products ? <sssss> they are a bit pricey , but usually have good deals where you can stock up , especially around the holidays . <sssss> my fav items are the lil hand sanitizers , lil hand lotions -lrb- both good for my purse -rrb- , candles & their hand soaps that look great in my kitchen . <sssss> they have the best scents too , with warm vanilla sugar , vanilla noel -lrb- holiday special -rrb- , coconut lime & country apple being some of my favs . <sssss> i 've been going here since hs , so i 'm sure i 'll be going here till i 'm an old lady ! 
4		what a great spot ! <sssss> we had sunday brunch there ... eggs benie with sweet pepper hollandaise sauce . <sssss> yuuuuummmmm ! 
4		i know why they do n't have one of these in california . <sssss> f'reals ... if they opened this up , ucsd asian-ness would be all over it in a crazy eating frenzy . <sssss> came here with ucsd dragon boat team before a race day and heck , we were ready to stuff our faces ! <sssss> this place makes khan 's mongolian grill in utc look like trash . <sssss> instead of yelling at you for piling on too many meat -lrb- or veggies if that 's your thang -rrb- , this place encourages it ! <sssss> yeah ! <sssss> plus , you can opt for one massive bowl or if you 're a crazy big eater , you can opt for unlimited bowls . <sssss> yc must stand for `` you crazzzzzzzy '' if you eat that much . <sssss> only downside here is that all the sauces kind of taste the same after a while . <sssss> if that 's not enough for your stomach to explode , there 's endless soup , chips , rice , drinks , and frozen yogurt for you to gorge on . <sssss> they take all your needs into account ... including a plunger in each stall of the bathroom . <sssss> awesome !! 
4		i 'm being on the generous side in giving mebad -lrb- as i 've seen others refer to this place -rrb- 4 stars ... it 's kind of a unique gem that you do n't see anymore with the owner at the register and a slamming lunch business in addition to the grocery items for sale that are rare foods , snacks , and ingredients from the middle east . <sssss> i suggested this place for lunch with amy d today after reading about it on yelp awhile back ... so happy i finally made it there myself ! <sssss> as amy said in her review , we shared the baba ganoush and hummus plate and we each ordered a greek salad . <sssss> the salad was decent but nothing special , but the baba and hummus with the whole wheat pita was so damn tasty that we did n't even leave a bite . <sssss> the free cup of homemade daily lemonade was a perk and the owner was really sweet ... and i really did like the flavor of it . <sssss> i happen to love lemonade ! <sssss> i 'll for sure return to mebad when i 'm in the area to try more from their menu ... this is the kind of place you want people to know about since you can tell how much work the owner and staff put into it each day . <sssss> if you have n't been , stop by ... maybe i 'll see you there - but please do n't ask me to share my baba ganoush and hummus with you - i 'm ordering my own next time ! 
4		so many good things about this joint ! <sssss> first and foremost , all the scottsdale snobs perpetrating a fraud seem to have made their way over to romper room pizza across the way . <sssss> this is really great news as their entitled brat kids are with them over there too . <sssss> yeah ! <sssss> ok now that i got that off my chest ... the food is fantastic ! <sssss> i love their simple grow happy salad . <sssss> it is hard to believe they can get so many different veggies into that bowl and the dressing is honestly one of the best around . <sssss> next ask for the charcuterie and cheese board `` score sheet '' and order up ! <sssss> be sure to ask for extra cornichons and fried capers on the side ... delish ! <sssss> you will be too full to eat anything else at this point but you need to power through the pain and keep going ... i promise you , any of the flatbreads will knock your socks off ! <sssss> but take a leap of faith and go with the brussel sprout pancetta ... once you have brussels this way , you are gon na want to go back to illinois and smack your momma for making you eat them boiled when you were a child -lrb- oh wait , that is what i wanted to do , you can go to where ever you are from and smack her -rrb- . <sssss> finally , sunday brunch is awesome out on the deck and you can get good and s ** t faced on $ 5 bloodies and maomosa 's to try and drown your sorrow that you have to go back to work tomorrow ! <sssss> see you on the patio . <sssss> . <sssss> just leave your kids at the sitter , no chicken nuggets to be seen here . <sssss> oh wait ... just remembered one other ca n't miss , the crispy fingerling potates with red pepper aoili ! <sssss> soooo yummy ! 
4		ca n't hate on some l&l , grew up in hawaii through middle school and high school . <sssss> back home l&l is considered fast food , generally you get your plate lunch from a truck or local restaurant not l&l . <sssss> but when your on the main land , l&l is a blessing !! <sssss> closest thing you can get and i 'm not complaining . <sssss> for those of you that are looking for something to try , chicken katsu is always a good starter , basically breaded chicken with a tangy dipping sauce . <sssss> my go to meal is the hamburger steak , 2 hamburger patties covered in gravy with rice . <sssss> it just works !! <sssss> other good choice would be the kalua pork . <sssss> you can always get half/half and add some bbq too . <sssss> make sure you try the mac salad , i 'm not normally a big fan of mac salad but its a must here ! <sssss> great service to boot also . 
4		i am now a huge fan of this facility . <sssss> this place is giant . <sssss> it 's like the disneyland of bowling . <sssss> probably because it 's in the middle-of-nowhere suburbs of phoenix ! <sssss> expansive lanes and a great arcade area filled with awesome ticketed games . <sssss> they had a great deal for $ 10 a person with an hour of bowling , shoes , and $ 5 of video game play . <sssss> it was so much fun ! <sssss> the one thing that 's weird is the service . <sssss> you pay your server at the lane , but our server was often nowhere to be found . <sssss> if they had better service , i 'd give them a 5 star ! 
4		driving around today we got the munchies . <sssss> was looking for jacquelines market place , but did n't realize that it was renamed to cafe carumba about 5 years ago . <sssss> i fought with the idea of having breakfast , but since i all ready ate breakfast , i settled on the appetizers.there were four of us so we all ordered appetizers : tres hummus plate , nachos in a bowl with tri-color chips , chicken quesadilla and chipotle southwest eggroll . <sssss> that hit the spot . <sssss> the nachos in a bowl and southwest egg rolls were a hit and the quesdilla and hummus plate were okay . <sssss> the server was slow coming to our patio table , maybe it was because he or someone dropped a tray load of water glasses by the entrance to the patio ... job opening . <sssss> but , after that , he was very attentive . 
4		it was christmas night and my wife went out for our annual movie night . <sssss> this place was open so we grabbed a cocktail or seven and enjoyed all the other people celebrating their own post family christmas . <sssss> the food was good and the drinks were poured well . <sssss> staff was very friendly in-spite of working christmas , everyone seemed to be in a good mood . 
4		service is always solid . <sssss> above and beyond . <sssss> food has occasionally been a bit salty ... love the fresh squeezed juice from bar for cocktails . 
4		aces ! <sssss> no complaints good or bad . <sssss> usually pretty busy inside like most starbucks , as far as seating . 
4		so i know the name is cheesy . <sssss> but this place serves up a mean burger . <sssss> too bad we did n't have more time to explore it for dinner , because it had a sweet looking bar filled to the ceilings with hard liquor . <sssss> dark ambiance filled with booths , a visible kitchen , and lots of lively conversation . <sssss> yes , this place is known for fabulous white chocolate desserts . <sssss> but dammit , that cheeseburger left room for absolutely none of that . <sssss> it 's sad , but true ... we left here without eating a bite of anything that had white chocolate in it . <sssss> fail . <sssss> caprese salad was surprisingly good , service was excellent , and did i mention the burger ??? <sssss> try it , and please have some dessert for me . <sssss> the wc bread pudding looked sinfully ass-packing-fat good . 
4		wow ! <sssss> some things never change ! <sssss> i popped in today to update my membership . <sssss> the front desk is awesome ! <sssss> even though i had a high maintenance request i was still handled with the utmost attention . <sssss> -lrb- yes , that 's me . <sssss> being needy . -rrb- <sssss> i had run into the awesome operations manager outside , chris m. who was happy to point me to a go to contact . <sssss> -lrb- even though he was off the clock . -rrb- <sssss> that 's swell ! <sssss> it 's unfortunate la fitness no longer prioritizes yelp reviews -lrb- as yelp reviews are no longer on their intranet -rrb- but yelp peeps read reviews . <sssss> so i write them . <sssss> this is still a neat place . <sssss> it is conveniently located and provides a high level of customer service . <sssss> this place is a freezer ! <sssss> the ac is cranking ! <sssss> i heard the cooler temps are due to the renovation . <sssss> i have n't had the fun of working out here since the updates . <sssss> but oh boy . <sssss> it was chilly ! <sssss> -lrb- yay ! -rrb- <sssss> having now visited a number of la fitness locations in phoenix i can say the following with confidence ... although some of the equipment is older , members clean up after themselves like they are preparing for surgery . <sssss> if you 're a germaphobe this is n't a great place to workout . <sssss> members religiously use the soapy and gel stuff . <sssss> there are paper towels readily available . <sssss> -lrb- staff is really good about keeping supplies stocked too . <sssss> i 've been witness to immediate response when a report is made that the paper towels are out . -rrb- <sssss> the cleaning crew does a vigorous vacuuming . <sssss> have no fear , this place is clean ! <sssss> the classes here are awesome . <sssss> i do n't know where they source their teachers but i adore all of them . <sssss> * i have a healthy respect for gina who teaches the bodyworkout + abs class thursday am . <sssss> initially it was a mixture of fear and hatred . <sssss> -lrb- but in a good way ! <sssss> :-rrb- * if aimee is teaching , try her class . <sssss> be ready , she 's intense . <sssss> very intense . <sssss> * if yoga is your thing , they have some great teachers too . <sssss> my personal favorite is john . <sssss> -lrb- the man is a rubber band with super human strength . -rrb- <sssss> personal training * gerard rocks . <sssss> if you can get on his calendar i highly recommend it . <sssss> check out my before/recent photo in my pictures . <sssss> please tell him i referred you . <sssss> he really is great . <sssss> * yes , the gym is crowded at peak times . <sssss> if you can , workout at an off-peak time . <sssss> -lrb- duh . -rrb- <sssss> so wait until 7pm . <sssss> or get here before 5pm . <sssss> i hear mornings are full ... but i 'm not ever up that early . <sssss> * yes , this is definitely a social place for some men . <sssss> this works to straight women 's advantage . <sssss> no one is going to bother you . <sssss> * yes , the locker rooms have seen better days . <sssss> but the showers produce fire hose worthy pressure . <sssss> * if you 're taking a body works or step class at a peak time and 8lb weights are your thing ... consider bringing your own . <sssss> there are only 4 sets -lrb- ! -rrb- <sssss> in the class . <sssss> * yes , there is n't enough space in the stretching area , but that 's true at almost any club . <sssss> this location is pretty chill about letting you grab a yoga mat -lrb- from the main class room -rrb- to use anywhere you find a space . <sssss> you do n't feel out of place doing an ab workout on the edge of a wall . <sssss> * yes , there are only three stair masters . <sssss> this sucks balls . <sssss> * yes , the machines are old . <sssss> so no tvs or anything fancy to distract you while you exercise . <sssss> get over it . <sssss> * yes , the step up weight machine has been broken for months . <sssss> do n't expect to use that anytime soon . <sssss> general comment about la fitness training . <sssss> that stuff works . <sssss> i just went in for a fitness eval / measurements seven months out . <sssss> hot damn i 'm happy . <sssss> http://tinyurl.com/llb3 
4		i have n't experienced a whole lot of korean food , but this was the best i 've had in the area ! <sssss> i could tell it was going to be good because everyone else in the restaurant was korean . <sssss> i was concerned after reading some of the reviews about service , but we were seated right away and were given menus immediately . <sssss> our orders were taken just a couple moments later . <sssss> the only bad thing was they ended up giving the appetizer we ordered to another table , and so we had to wait for that to come with the main dishes , which we had to wait for about 25-30 minutes to get . <sssss> otherwise the service was very friendly . <sssss> i ordered the seafood tofu soup , which had a great flavor ! <sssss> i 'm not really used to dealing with whole prawns though , so that was an experience . <sssss> all the little side dishes were yummy as well , and came with good sticky rice . <sssss> so overall , great food , okay service . <sssss> what i ordered was n't too crazy price-wise , but my boyfriend 's dish was kind of expensive . <sssss> the food was so good , though , i had to give 4 stars . <sssss> will probably return the next time i want korean food , but will have to make sure i save up a little . 
4		so ... i love this place . <sssss> the extremely spicy gyoza hot pot sold me on this place the first time i went and i return over and over again just to have it . <sssss> that said , i 've tried relatively few things . <sssss> the sushi is fine , not amazing . <sssss> i like it enough to order it most times i go but i would n't go there just for sushi . <sssss> the lettuce wraps with shrimp and vegetables are good but messy to eat since they are served with thinnish romaine leaves rather than the round butter lettuce leaves most places use . <sssss> my husband gets the pasta every once in a while and loves it . <sssss> i 've tried his plates a couple times and i think it 's good , not great , but that could be because he drowns it in shredded parmesan and i ca n't taste the real flavor it came out of the kitchen with . <sssss> next time i will get tan tan men . <sssss> other yelpers have raved about the ramen and , although i 've never tried it , i expect it to be delicious because it 's made with the same soup as the extremely gyoza hot pot which , as i already mentioned , i love . <sssss> now for the not so good ... -lrb- but not so bad either -rrb- ... the last time we went we sat at the bar for the first time . <sssss> like other reviewers , i definitely recommend sitting at the bar if you can for two reasons : 1 -rrb- when the place is busy , which it often is , the food takes a while to make it to your table and being able to watch the cooks provides a bit of entertainment to make the time pass quicker ; 2 -rrb- there 's more space at the bar than at the 2-person tables . <sssss> we usually feel pretty cramped at the 2-tops once we have drinks and an appetizer on the table but there 's a little more elbow room and room for plates and drinks at the bar . <sssss> however , sitting at the bar has a downside also ... when you can see the cooks putting all the plates together , though it 's entertaining , you can also see all the things they touch without wearing gloves . <sssss> i 've never been sick after eating here and i will continue to eat here frequently despite having seen all this , but it does make me pause to think a bit when i watch a cook dip his bare hand into some seafood -lrb- which he throws into a pan presumably hot enough to cook off any germs -rrb- and then wipe his hand on a repeatedly-used wet towel as he grabs a bunch of lettuce leaves for a salad plate -lrb- without any heat to cook off germs -rrb- that goes directly out to the customer . <sssss> admittedly , i do n't know much about proper food handling and what 's ok and what 's not , but bare handed food touching always weirds me out a little . <sssss> that said , the food is delicious . <sssss> it does take a while to get from ordering to eating but the cooks are hustling so i ca n't complain . <sssss> try the gyoza hot pot . <sssss> it 's awesome . <sssss> 5 stars without the wait and bare -lrb- but potentially clean-ish ?? -rrb- <sssss> hands on food . 
4		recently discovered that they offer free wifi at this location . <sssss> the food and service is still the same as my last review , so i 'm not going to bother rewriting all of that . <sssss> the wings and 1000 island burger are still my two favorite menu items . <sssss> one thing i like about this place ... when you sit at the bar , the bartenders ask what your name is and then they use it whenever they talk to you . <sssss> it makes you feel welcome and comfortable . <sssss> return factor - 100 % 
4		love coffee , recently started drinking it so i go here a lot . <sssss> close by my house whcih is a big plus since its the only drive through starbucks close by me . <sssss> i only gave it 4 stars because of the huge lines it gets . <sssss> and when there is a long line the employees always take forever to make drinks . <sssss> i went here at around 3 today and there was about 4 or 5 cars in front of me and the employees were slow and rushed me right when i got my drink from the drive through . 
4		we dined saturday night at lo cascio 's and had a great evening . <sssss> the restaurant was busy so we had to wait 15 minutes for a table . <sssss> the decor is a traditional italian restaurant theme with table cloths and candles on the table . <sssss> italian music added to the ambiance . <sssss> our waitress -lrb- kelly -rrb- greeted us and we ordered some wine . <sssss> the menu has all the italian favorites that you would expect including pizzas . <sssss> we both ordered spaghetti , one with marina and primavera vegetables and one with meat sauce and a side of meatballs . <sssss> soup or salad and bread came with the meals . <sssss> we had the salads and they were fresh and the homemade bleu cheese dressing was terrific . <sssss> the food and service were great . <sssss> we will make reservations next time and will certainly add this to our short list of favorite restaurants . 
4		always fantastic , but if you catch them when they 're busy with a big take-out order , you 'll wish you would 've called ahead . <sssss> if you ca n't avoid the lunch rush , it 's still worth the wait . 
4		so many times i have been driving to or from the lake and had a discussion with someone about how good we have heard the burgers were at wild horse west . <sssss> last year a friend and i stopped in to try it out . <sssss> this place is a bait shop and bar . <sssss> dirty boot cheap beer dive bar . <sssss> you can sit at the bar or on picnic tables inside possibly next to other patrons . <sssss> cash only . <sssss> chips only , no frys . <sssss> but the bugger is awesome . <sssss> thick greasy patty , melted cheese over mushrooms and thick crispy bacon -lrb- my way -rrb- . <sssss> one bite then you know why you came . <sssss> i dont care for bars at all so this is what we do . <sssss> call ahead and be a bit patient it is a loud crowded bar sometimes . <sssss> leave the family or friends with the boat and truck outside and grab every thing to go . <sssss> then its only a few minutes away from the lake . <sssss> now you can enjoy your awesomeness at the shore or on the water.it solves the problem of whats for dinner at the lake while setting up camp the first night . <sssss> cheap regular hot dogs for the tikes . <sssss> no more storys of good burgers.now its time to eat good burgers . 
4		love this place ! <sssss> from the neat building to the good food , and 1950s cocktails this place is a gem ! <sssss> great place to go for a business dinner , date or a girls night . <sssss> gone on some nights when the dj spins from above and have really enjoyed the ambience . <sssss> my dinner there usually consists of the bar plate to start and a pizza and you ca n't go wrong with that . <sssss> plus do yourself a favor and order a cocktail . <sssss> they always make an old fashion just right . 
4		open till late on saturday . <sssss> happening on weekends . <sssss> great for big crowds and also for a couple 
4		i had lunch here two days ago , having never stepped foot in a turkish restaurant before in my life . <sssss> i 'm an adventurous diner . <sssss> per my standard , i skipped the menu and ask the very friendly waitress/hostess to make a recommendation . <sssss> she suggested the iskender donner , as it is their signature dish . <sssss> i order the lunch portion and was quite pleased . <sssss> lots of great flavor . <sssss> the sauces were excellent . <sssss> nothing at all to complain about . <sssss> even the turkish coffee she suggested was nice -- and i 'm not much of a coffee drinker ! <sssss> high marks . <sssss> i 'm really looking forward to returning some evening when the hookas are blazing . 
4		had a great dinner at the white chocolate grill on friday . <sssss> the atmosphere was nice - high-backed booths and relaxing lighting . <sssss> our server was attentive and took very good care of us - always a plus . <sssss> the filet with bleu cheese was fantastic , and the white chocolate brownie was the perfect ending to the meal . <sssss> that with a couple of glasses of wine left me a happy girl ! 
4		amazing breakfast . <sssss> have come here on several occasions and am never disappointed with what i get . <sssss> stop by and check it out . 
4		home made potato salad . <sssss> fish fry is good . <sssss> lots stuff on the menu . <sssss> handy neighborhood place . <sssss> always return . 
4		tandoori times volume 1 , issue 1 , number 1 . <sssss> limited run . <sssss> copyright 2009 , mejimbo enterprises . <sssss> all rights reserved . <sssss> dateline 7 may 2009 scottsdale , arizona yelpers jim w and audrey w were reportedly seen enjoying lively conversation and delicious indian food with donald s and carin s. witnesses claim the group was laughing loudly at times . <sssss> one bystander reported , `` that was a guffaw . <sssss> that outburst right there was definitely a guffaw . <sssss> wild stuff . '' <sssss> sources have related to this publication that the group dined on two appetizers , one known as a bread basket which consisted of four types of naan bread . <sssss> jim w was overheard to say , `` i really like the onion naan . '' <sssss> the other appetizer may have been aloo tikki . <sssss> this has not been confirmed as yet . <sssss> in any case the plate containing the reported aloo tikki was cleaned by the foursome , several even going so far as to swab at the remaining sauce on the plate . <sssss> the above sources also reported that the table was served an order of the friday daily special of kahari shrimp . <sssss> it was overheard by a nearby table that the shrimp was '' ... flavorful with strong notes of garlic and ginger . '' <sssss> this has not substantiated , however . <sssss> audrey w reportedly was served the lamb korma which she was rumored to have noted was `` yummy . '' <sssss> carin s apparently was served the chicken masala and donald s may have been served some sort of vindaloo that included potato . <sssss> it seems there was considerable sharing of the dishes around the table and the main dishes may have been spooned over what some experts have suggested was a basmati rice with various herbs and spices . <sssss> an unnamed source has informed this publication that while jim w claims to have particularly enjoyed the food and festive atmosphere which included a belly dancer and some swordplay , he was displeased with the excessive sound level produced by the in-house sound system and even requested that the music be reduced . <sssss> jim w 's blog had a statement this morning that read , in part ; '' ... ears have n't hurt the next morning like that since my last rock concert . <sssss> i really liked the food but i would n't go back on a night when they have dancing again . '' 
4		it took nearly 20 minutes for me to get my sub but overall great food and friendly staff . <sssss> ill definitely be back 
4		the chicken shawarma is stellar . <sssss> i get it to go at least once a month , substituting veggies for the rice . <sssss> slightly pricey , but you get a lot of food and it 's very consistent . 
4		great atmosphere ... great service ... great food and desert menu !!! <sssss> the people there were very nice , positive and happy ! <sssss> i ordered ... buffalo wings - way too salty , i could n't even finish them it was that much !! <sssss> great texture though peanut thai bowl - very good !!!! <sssss> pumpkin pie tsoynami - amazing oatmeal cream pie - very good !! 
4		went on tuesdays for t-bone special and it was fantastic . <sssss> very friendly staff with great service . 
4		i 've been trying to look for a suitable substitute for pho here , since i eat it back home all the time . <sssss> compared to all the other places in the pheonix/glendale area i 've been to , this is probably the best pho place and it 's about 30 min from where i live . <sssss> it 's not as good as the pho in the bay area , but it tastes close enough . <sssss> the servers are really nice and the restaurant is clean which is a plus , since most pho places that taste really good are kind of dirty , and mom and pop-like , similar in vietnam . <sssss> since i 'm vietnamese , it works in my favor -lrb- i feel like i get more food and more quickly too -rrb- . <sssss> we came in a huge group and they reserved a table for us -lrb- unlike most vietnamese places which get you in and out as quickly as possible ! -rrb- <sssss> most of us got pho , we shared spring rolls , and some others got bbq rice plates and bun bo hue -lrb- spicy beef noodle -rrb- . <sssss> they even brought out the special onions to put in the pho -lrb- by request only -rrb- . <sssss> i think some got the special desserts and liked them as well . <sssss> we all left really happy and most of us are from california so we know what good pho is ; -rrb- 
4		after hearing about this place in the paper and from the chef/owner of barrio cafe as a savory , cheap eat , i finally gave it a try earlier this year and have been wanting to go back ! <sssss> i had half a regular torta with the tender slices of beef -lrb- mmm ... little slices of heaven -rrb- , avocado , that pork , all on a white roll . <sssss> and there 's no way i could finish a whole torta . <sssss> so , from a budget standpoint , it 's even more worth the money . <sssss> also tried one of their huge huarache , corn tortilla that was snowed on by queso fresco . <sssss> anyone who goes must have one of their fresh fruit juices . <sssss> they have a wonderful variety and it 's a nice kick with meaty , not-sweet menu . <sssss> it 's definitely one of those places where there are more natives than gringos , which is a good sign . 
4		looking for some good thai food i came across this restaurant . <sssss> i was quite impressed with this place . <sssss> another restaurant located in a boring strip center , but what else is new for the phoenix metro . <sssss> the decor is very appealing and the music playing in the background adds to the experience . <sssss> the service is great and helpful . <sssss> we all know we come for the food though . <sssss> portions were just about the right size and full of the spicy flavors that i was looking for . <sssss> when i 'm in the area i 'll have to check this place out again and would recommend the restaurant to anyone who likes thai food . 
4		e -lrb- my moh and fellow yelper ! -rrb- <sssss> and i went to the phoenix bridal expo back in january and we just happened to stop by the davids bridal booth . <sssss> $ 50 off coupon just for booking an appointment at the expo . <sssss> sold ! <sssss> now i had looked at the dresses on line and had a few already `` favorited '' on the site under my account . <sssss> so when my dress appointment happened on february 13th , i knew which ones i wanted to look at . <sssss> i arrive with my entourage -lrb- my mom , grandmother , e , my bridesmaids , and a few friends -rrb- and i 'm greeted upon entry . <sssss> i state i have an appointment with patty -lrb- i think that was her name -rrb- and shortly after , patty comes up , greets us , and we head back to the fitting area . <sssss> i told patty what i was looking for and not looking for . <sssss> much to my mother 's disapproval what i was n't looking for was a pretty pretty princess , 20lbs of tulle , poofy shoulders gown with a cathedral length veil . <sssss> sorry ma ! <sssss> ai n't happening . <sssss> patty listened to my concerns and offered lots of feedback . <sssss> i tried on my first dress -lrb- which i loved online , but was n't sure how it was going to look when i put it on -rrb- and immediately fell in love ! <sssss> i tried on at least 4 other dresses , including a ppp with a floor length veil to appease my mother . <sssss> patty saw my frustration and thankfully stepped in when my mom was about ready to pull dresses for me . <sssss> patty suggested i try on the first dress again , which i did . <sssss> i knew it was the one , especially with everyone exclaiming that the dress had me -lrb- my personality -rrb- written all over it . <sssss> oh and the most awesome part , i was able to purchase the sample dress ! <sssss> i wanted a sample as opposed to ordering a new dress . <sssss> watching say yes to the dress taught me one thing - how a dress fits and lies on the body might be a little different with a brand new dress , than the sample one . <sssss> with the sample , its like wearing your favorite pair of jeans , they 're broken in . <sssss> :-rrb- cleaning and pressing were included in the price . <sssss> sweet !! <sssss> sold ! <sssss> the only slip-up and reason why i cant give them 5 stars is the fact that my special order pieces -lrb- the bra and slip -rrb- were not included on the order when i purchased the dress and accessories . <sssss> something i should have caught before i paid . <sssss> but none the less a quick call , and everything was fixed . <sssss> they even held my special order items for about 2 months after they arrived -lrb- the next time i 'd be in that area for the bridesmaid dress appointment -rrb- . <sssss> all in all , great people/company to work with ! 
4		panel change out . <sssss> i checked with several contractors and the prices ranged from $ 3600 to $ 1300 . <sssss> ee was not the lowest bid -lrb- but almost -rrb- . <sssss> i liked they were licensed , bonded and insured and a member of the bbb . <sssss> changing a panel is not rocket science but they did it right , took about 3 hours , the rest of the day was spent waiting for the city of phoenix to earn their `` permit fee '' - at least when i pay my doctor $ 150 i get an appointment-and , of course srp to re-energize the system . <sssss> . <sssss> a four hour job wound up being all day - not always the case , just be warned . <sssss> i had good communications with tamira , they kept me up-to-date and even filed the permit for me at no extra charge . <sssss> even had greg add a dedicated circuit while they were waiting around ! 
4		great food , fresh , flavorful . <sssss> relaxed efficient service . 
4		i 'd love to have one of these in tucson , and rumor has it that we might ! <sssss> i love a crisp and hearty salad - and chop shop delivers on both counts . <sssss> i have yet to dine in , as lunch has been brought to the office on both occasions , so i 'm holding off on that extra star for a dine-in experience . <sssss> the kale caesar salad with chicken is my go-to choice . <sssss> the salad is quite large and filling . <sssss> i 'm not entirely sure of the dressing is light or low cal , but since its served on the side for to-go orders i have n't experienced anything less than a fresh and crisp salad . <sssss> per gabi m 's recommendation , i ordered a pita wrap on the side . <sssss> make mini wraps out of your salad - delish ! <sssss> i 've also tasted a quinoa salad with veggies which was also super light . <sssss> so far , it makes for a perfect lunch at the office . <sssss> i look forward to trying their juice ! 
4		oh biancos . <sssss> this is n't really a restaurant you can just say `` hey , lets go get a quick bite to eat '' . <sssss> this is a commitment of time . <sssss> there are other pizza places in phoenix , with perfectly good food . <sssss> biancos though , it 's more of an experience . <sssss> expect to spend at least 4 hours here . <sssss> 1 ish hours waiting to get on the list , and then 2ish hours waiting to get into the restaurant , then an hour of eating . <sssss> why would you want to do that ?! <sssss> well , because it 's fun . <sssss> make sure you go with a group of people you can have great conversations with . <sssss> go when the weather is fantastic , and make sure you want to have some fun . <sssss> i always enjoy waiting in line with a glass of wine from bar bianco , which is next door . <sssss> you can start your tab over there , and carry it over to the restaurant when you are seated . <sssss> after you get on the list , the bar will also keep track of you and inform you when the restaurant is ready for you . <sssss> biancos is located in a quiet , great little section of phx where there is actual grass and trees . <sssss> so waiting will be in a park , where you can stand around and chat with friends and strangers . <sssss> i always find myself , and my party chatting it up with the other people in line ... we all know we are going to be there for a while , so might as well socialize . <sssss> the food is always amazing . <sssss> i 've gone several times and have tried most of the menu . <sssss> my one bit of advice , always get fresh basil on your pizza . <sssss> it 's an extra cost , but makes a world of difference , no matter what pizza you get . <sssss> the margarita pizza is still my favorite of them all , it 's perfection . <sssss> just go , expect to wait , and try to make the best of it . <sssss> it 'll be a great time with friends , with wine , pizza , fresh air , and that basil . <sssss> : -rrb- 
4		i had the pollo fundido here , it was pretty good . <sssss> i think you would like this place if you are someone who 's not afraid of cheese and a little grease to go with that . <sssss> its sonoran style so u should know that there is gon na be a bit of cheese thrown in . <sssss> as for the grease , it comes from all the frying : -rrb- they have pretty decent salsa and chips , but i guess the bean dip does not come standard any more because i did not see them serve that with the chips . <sssss> maybe you got to ask for it . <sssss> food alone should give this place 4-5 stars but the service was a little underpar . <sssss> its not that bad , but certainly was just sufficient without any attempts to improve . <sssss> the host was in the midst of seating me but stopped to address an issue with the kitchen on a phone order . <sssss> i guess its not a big deal as the bus boys were really fast and would bring u , the salsa and chips and greet u warmly . <sssss> as for my server , well i guess she would be a 7/10 service-wise . <sssss> passable but not exceeding anything . <sssss> she was in a hurry to put her order in and i noticed her doing the same thing to other customers too . <sssss> when the table next to me asked what kind of meat was in their chilli rellenos , she just replied , there is no meat in the chilli rellenos , without any explanation of what it was and if there is an alternative . <sssss> the customer got convinced into ordering a pollo fundido which according to the waitress was the same as a chilli rellenos but with a chicken -lrb- not really ! -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> in her defense , she was not rude or uncaring , just very order-oriented and focused on fulfilling them . <sssss> she would go around and ask if everything was okay with her charges and did ask if i needed a refill on my ice teas . <sssss> i guess its better than a server who would not come around at all , that would be worse . <sssss> so perhaps you would want to view the menu online first , using the link on this page and then read about what they were , so you can ask `` educated '' questions about the foods or know right up front what you want , so they can bring you something nice and hot to eat real fast :-rrb- i would come back again if i am craving a nice cheesy -lrb- in a good way -rrb- meal . <sssss> also the view is pretty good , its overlooking a little lake that it shares a view with coffee rush . 
4		my wife and i have been here 3 or 4 different times . <sssss> we always take an entertainment or restaurant.com gift certificate for a buy one get one free or $ 25 off deal . <sssss> last night was our best experience yet there . <sssss> we ordered a caesar salad to share and when it was delivered the kitchen had already split the plate . <sssss> i was surprised how much there was after it was split , it was plenty . <sssss> i must almost mention the rolls and butter . <sssss> i usually do n't , it 's like commenting on a mexican restaurant 's chips , but these were great , crusty but still chewy . <sssss> but it was the honey butter that really made it great . <sssss> after salads , the entrees came . <sssss> i had salmon and my wife had the sirloin -lrb- it was her concession since i would take her to flemings because we already went to temple and a reception before dinner -rrb- . <sssss> both were amazing . <sssss> the salmon was the best i 'd ever had and i boarded with a family who fished for salmon in the north pacific off alaska every year and they knew how to cook salmon . <sssss> it had a great slightly spicy glaze with this amazing lemony sauce on a bed of greens . <sssss> my wife 's sirloin was melt in your mouth tender with a spicy , smokey barbeque sauce served with garlic and buttered spinach and roasted baby potatoes . <sssss> this was a meal fit for a king , yet we left without leaving more than $ 40 ! <sssss> 4 stars to pinon grill . 
4		if ye on thee west side , ye must indulge thine 's hunger with pizza by napoli . <sssss> this is your basic pizza joint . <sssss> nothing special , just damn good ny style pizza . <sssss> they have cheap lunch slice specials . <sssss> anytime i 'm over in this area i 'll hit up a couple of slices here ... they still remember me from when i lived in the area and it 's been like 3 years . <sssss> ironically , the family that owns it looks mobster like , but they 're from albania , not sicily . 
4		being drug to a cardinals game with my season ticket holding friends was a bit difficult for me . <sssss> . <sssss> im in love with my 49ers ... and the cardinals could well knock them out of the running for the nfc west . <sssss> . <sssss> anything ! <sssss> plus i love my candlestick back home . <sssss> . <sssss> but this stadium is the bombfootballdiggity . <sssss> . <sssss> ac . <sssss> . <sssss> retractable roof . <sssss> . <sssss> well managed . <sssss> . <sssss> thats a hit . <sssss> . <sssss> even if it is the cardinals : - -rrb- 
4		hi , i 'd like a decaf iced americano with a side of sorry i do n't have tribal tattoos , gauges , and a pseudo-lumberjack beard . <sssss> in all seriousness , though , cartel is a pretty cool place to hang out and get school work done , despite the fact that it may be too cool for school . <sssss> the environment is open , spacious , and definitely the kind of place where i feel like i 'm paying three bucks to park myself somewhere conducive to productivity for a few hours , rather than for the actual coffee . <sssss> you might as well say `` make me a drink that 's stronger than me , '' because that 's essentially anything at cartel . <sssss> i 'm sure it hurts so good if you 're looking for a caffeine rush , but if you drink decaf , the high-intensity , bitter brew is basically like drinking an o'doul 's - neither effective , nor genuinely enjoyable . <sssss> however , for the general college population , cartel provides all the resources necessary to help you pound out that essay/assignment/tumblr post/article as seamlessly as possible . 
4		well all walgreens are essentially the same . <sssss> pharmacy team is great and fast ! 
4		pancakes this big should be illegal . <sssss> that is all . 
4		a few months ago i drove by my favorite , remind me of back east wonderful pizza place , and cried when i noticed it was gone . <sssss> after sitting down and crying with a few friends who loved the place too , we moved on with plenty of grief mgt and support . <sssss> today i was thrilled to go here and learn it is the same owners and same place , just a new name . <sssss> i am back in heaven ! <sssss> tonight i tried something different , a caprese salad pannini . <sssss> it came with home made potato chips . <sssss> -lrb- always a plus-yum -rrb- and greens to boot -lrb- because you know your body needs those vitamins -rrb- the meal was great . <sssss> i ordered a side servng of an italian sausgage -lrb- my weakness and hard to find good in az -rrb- one was enough to feed 4 . <sssss> a little spicy and good . <sssss> the only thing i did not care about was the sauce it was served on . <sssss> i come from a place where sauce is called gravy and i like sauce thick not thin . <sssss> but hey , i did not expect the sausage to have any sauce on it so no big deal to me . <sssss> it was delish!i ended with tiramusu , always a nice ending . <sssss> i went home with a 20 extra pounds on my hips and in leftover doggie bags . <sssss> ahhhhh sweet heaven ! 
4		had the 6 course meal . <sssss> interesting concept . <sssss> no menu , just a list of what you do n't want . <sssss> everything else is open season . <sssss> the concept is great but i was hoping for more of an iron chef experience . <sssss> i came away feeling that they really only make a few dishes each night and you 're going to get one of those regardless of how `` adventurous '' you are on the list . <sssss> example , gf said she did n't like soft cheese -lrb- i know . <sssss> . <sssss> insane right ? -rrb- <sssss> , guess what her first course had on it ? <sssss> i 'm new in town and was happy to see the creativity . <sssss> but the execution could have been better . <sssss> wine pairings were great . <sssss> meal was about $ 200 before tip for 6 courses for 2 people with one wine pairing . 
4		i love their wings , the pizza is ok , they do have an ok amount of tvs to watch & have little sound boxes you can put on your table so you can hear the tv -lrb- assuming the music is n't blaring -rrb- . <sssss> not our favorite sports bar place but we stop in every once in a while . 
4		i am a fan of olive garden 's unlimited soup and salad lunch and i had a very good experience today at this location . <sssss> i was surprised at how busy the restaurant was at 11:30 am on a saturday afternoon but hey they must be doing something right . <sssss> my sister and i were seated right away and our server was very nice and brought drinks and salad very quickly . <sssss> we ordered zuppa toscana and as always it was hot and delicious . <sssss> overall good experience . <sssss> i would definitely come back for lunch . 
4		bomb food and great service !! <sssss> my little pr club has its meetings here and it is always a great experience . <sssss> they will pretty much cook you anything you want or make any drink you can think of , as long as they have the stuff . <sssss> the humus plate is amazing and their iced tea is bomb , i like all of fruit ones mixed together . <sssss> they are always inventing new dishes , like the buffalo wing pizza , which is tasty too ... oh and its healthy ! <sssss> i just need to go for breakfast now ... 
4		several people suggested that i revisit pappadeaux and since it 's close and i often eat seafood out i did . <sssss> i had a very different exsperience this time . <sssss> i sat on the patio this time and i found the patio very pleasant and comfortable . <sssss> we started with the in house made hot smoked salmon appetizer . <sssss> we received a generous portion of salmon topped with a mustard herb sauce and seasoned thin crisp bread toasts . <sssss> the salmon seemed like it was slow cooked as it just melted like butter in your mouth . <sssss> i also liked that it was lightly smoked and not too much so you could get the yummy taste of the sauce with it . <sssss> i thought this was a masterfully prepared dish and this one really wowed me as i would like to get it again some time . <sssss> we received our dinners . <sssss> my husband ordered the gulf coast redfish pontchartrain and i got the halibut with spaghetti squash . <sssss> i taste the redfish and this one is perfect , it 's fresh , tasty and prepared perfect . <sssss> then i taste the halibut and it 's overcooked and dry . <sssss> i sort of feared sending it back since it was still edible but my husband convinced me to do so . <sssss> we flagged the waiter over and he took care of it right away and sent the manager over . <sssss> the manager and the waiter were extremely kind and did n't at all make me feel guilty for sending the fish back . <sssss> they also remade my husband 's dinner so he could have a fresh one with me and also gave him the option of nibbling on the current one he had if he wanted to . <sssss> the manager even suggested having some salad or soup while we wait he really could n't be more hospitable . <sssss> we receive our new dinners and both were very good . <sssss> my halibut was much better as it was tasty and flaky and moist . <sssss> the spaghetti squash was good it was slightly sweet and buttery and the redfish was nailed perfect again , it was really delicious . <sssss> the manager checked on us and said we could have dessert on them . <sssss> we enjoyed the dinners very much and over ate a bit so we did n't have room for dessert but we saw someone walk by with a dessert tray and they looked really good . <sssss> this was an educational exsperience for me . <sssss> i know i can come back to pappdeaux because the food will be good or they will do their best to make it again right for you . <sssss> i will try to be a better diner and say something to my server if i need too . 
4		the food here is delicious ! <sssss> i had the bruschetta , chicken parmesan , and tiramisu , and would highly recommend all of them . <sssss> i would rate this place five stars , but my server was not very friendly and they were out of the wine and dessert i wanted :-lrb- if the rating were based purely on the food , they would definitely have the full five stars ! <sssss> i will definitely be back . 
4		the seasonal raspberry white chocolate chip pancakes are amazing ! <sssss> it comes with eggs , bacon , sausage and hash browns . <sssss> you will not be disappointed . 
4		i stopped in for a weekday lunch , and eliana 's was busy . <sssss> the server said , `` i have n't seen you in a long time . <sssss> do you want to see the menu , or do you already know what you want ? '' <sssss> i ordered my usual : dos pupusas con carne . <sssss> and flan , for dessert . <sssss> i am a sucker for a place that recognizes me . <sssss> i do n't love everything on eliana 's menu , but i love these things . <sssss> the pupusas arrived at my table piping hot . <sssss> i use all of the cabbage salad on top of them , and about half of the sauce . <sssss> yummy goodness ! <sssss> i 've tried a few other things on their menu : fried yucca -lrb- interesting -rrb- beans and cream for dessert -lrb- not so much -rrb- . <sssss> i 'll stick with what i know and love . <sssss> plus , eliana 's is right down the street from my office , and the prices ca n't be beat . <sssss> one caveat : i ordered my lunch to go once , and the packaging left a lot to be desired . <sssss> the sauce came in a baggie . 
4		i ca n't dance . <sssss> . <sssss> yes i can ! <sssss> well tonight the hubby and i took our first dance lesson and what a hoot ! <sssss> had a blast . <sssss> the instructor 's approach was clear and easy to follow . <sssss> she did a great job at blending focus on the instruction with keeping it fun and upbeat . <sssss> the facility is pleasant , immaculate and huge - and available to students for practice at any time , not just during their lessons . <sssss> as mentioned in a previous review , they have a great deal for first time students . <sssss> the best thing for couples is that the price per lesson is the same whether for a single or a couple . <sssss> because i 've only done one lesson , and my first dance lesson every -lrb- well since high school , but the dinosaurs because extinct since then -rrb- , i 'm looking forward to more lessons and the opportunity to add a star . 
4		although some of you may have the idea that i was born with the ability to use chopsticks , i 'd like to announce that i am pretty sure i would n't know how to use them at all if it was n't for da vang . <sssss> being westsider-riders , my family and i have been eating at this restaurant for as long as i can remember . <sssss> my mom 's old hair salon was only a mile away , so we often stopped by in the morning for banh mi or spring rolls take-out . <sssss> if you 're not familiar with banh mi , make sure you try to catch one of the episodes of no reservations when bourdain goes to vietnam . <sssss> a bite of the banh mi -lrb- sandwich -rrb- is like having a flavor explosion in my mouth . <sssss> sometimes i 'm not a fan of the lightly pickled cucumber , but the jalapeno slices always gives me a nice jolt of spiciness , and the flavors of the meat are awesome ! <sssss> you can always ask them to remove any of those items from the sandwich . <sssss> the pho here is always good , and my brother and i also love the bun bo hue , which comes with vermicelli noodles and a dang good , spicy broth . <sssss> the meats they toss in here are n't typically what you 'd find on mom 's dinner table , so make sure you read the menu and are cool with those . <sssss> the reviews regarding the decor are definitely accurate . <sssss> had i not been growing up on the stuff made here , i would probably think again about going back . <sssss> they have actually even remodeled , and expanded it since i was a child ! <sssss> if you 're that concerned about it , i suggest ordering take-out . <sssss> i 've never gotten sick from the food here , so i assume the kitchen is clean ! <sssss> another great plus is that the food is very affordable . <sssss> i had dinner here on sunday , and the total for two people in food comas was $ 11.25 . 
4		how is it that we find ourselves in scottsdale so often ? <sssss> ugh . <sssss> but , when you have an opportunity to partake in some lunch with a bestie ... we had heard that brio was really good , and it did not disappoint . <sssss> the hostess at the front was nice , sweet , and had a great sense of humor . <sssss> we were seated promptly , and ordered arnold palmers and water for 3 as we waited for our 3rd . <sssss> the lemonade is fresh squeezed and made in house . <sssss> honestly , the ap 's were bomb ! <sssss> i ordered the chef 's special pasta , which had bacon -lrb- mmmmm baaacon ! -rrb- <sssss> and carmelized onions in it . <sssss> it was good , but the lobster bisque i ordered before my entree showed up was exquisite . <sssss> gf ordered a breaded chicken salad , which i had a couple of bites of , and i thought it was great too . <sssss> service was top notch , and the price was fair . <sssss> all together a great experience . <sssss> i love the interior decor , as well . <sssss> it is well lit from above , but not too bright from the sides . <sssss> the lights are super cool also . <sssss> looking forward to going back for happy hour . 
4		i grew up close to this place and their american style pizza and wings have always been great . <sssss> large groups can be easily accommodated and the atmosphere is fairly laid back at nello 's . <sssss> it '' s too bad the trolley does n't go by here anymore : -lrb- 
4		hello ! <sssss> me and my husband went there today and really liked the food . <sssss> the hummus was tasty and spicy , they have a very good variety of dishes and dessert . <sssss> they have so many choices that there were many items we did n't try . <sssss> we had to leave them for our next visit . <sssss> if you like this kind of food , please go check it out and support this business . <sssss> as others have said , the place is not fancy , but the food is worth a try , and the staff was very nice too . <sssss> also , if someone in your party is not very enthusiastic about mediterranan food , they have other popular choices such as indian dishes , lasagna , fajitas , etc. . <sssss> the greek salad is very good , also the naan and the baba ganoush . 
4		i 've discovered that i am a fiend for wood - or brick-fired oven pizza ... just love the thin , crispy , sometimes slighty charred crust that is created as a result of this process . <sssss> and i have to credit my recent trip to grimaldi 's for this self revelation . <sssss> thank you ! <sssss> we had a hankering for some pizza while on our trip to the scottsdale/phoenix area . <sssss> our aunt assured us that one of the best places to nosh on some authentic , brooklyn-based pizza was the original grimaldi 's location in dc ranch -lrb- not the newer location -rrb- . <sssss> our hungry party of four arrived at grimaldi 's at 6:45 pm on a lovely saturday evening , and were informed it would be a half-hour wait , which to me was quite reasonable for a payday-weekend-saturday night . <sssss> after walking around dc ranch for a bit to kill time , we got back and only had to wait about another 10 minutes -lrb- because we did n't want to sit at a high top table , which ended up being a bad call , but i 'll get to that later -rrb- , which was kinda torture because this place smells soooooo good and we were starving ! <sssss> all told , the food was amazingly good with huge portions ! <sssss> our small antipasto salad was great , as was our aunt/uncle 's `` small '' mediterranean salad . <sssss> the `` small '' pizza was delicious , as was the `` small '' calzone that hubby and i split . <sssss> i also enjoyed their passion fruit iced tea . <sssss> two last things : 1 . <sssss> we got seated at a table in the back corner of the restaurant , which in itself was n't bad , but it was right next to an exit door and very rude families with kids kept going in and out the damn door . <sssss> let 's just say our aunt put a stop to that ! <sssss> 2 . <sssss> our server joe was excellent ! <sssss> kept the drinks refilled and cleared the table in a very timely manner . <sssss> he also commiserated with us having families with loud , uncontrolled kids being seated at the tables next to us . <sssss> ugh !! <sssss> that 's where we should have taken that high-top table in the bar/adults only area at the front of the restaurant ! <sssss> oh well , live and learn , right ?! <sssss> i loved this place , and ca n't wait to go back and eat there when we visit our aunt/uncle again . <sssss> : -rrb- 
4		it 's a grocery store , so you already know what to expect . <sssss> my review is for the florist . <sssss> i walked in to buy some flowers , no clue what i wanted . <sssss> the nice woman approached me , shared their flower selections , asked some good qualifying questions . <sssss> and when i decided to get two sets of flowers , she made a nice bouquet out of them , some ribbon . <sssss> i was quite satisfied , great customer service . 
4		got the veggie pho . <sssss> broth , veggies and noodles were great . <sssss> prices were good too . <sssss> my friend and i were the only gringos in the place . <sssss> will go back ! <sssss> cruddy ambiance , but we went for lunch ... not for a date ;o-rrb- my friend loved her food too . <sssss> she had the beef with eggrolls . <sssss> mmmm great place to experience pho for the first time . <sssss> everything comes with a description on the menu ;o-rrb- no alcohol . <sssss> . 
4		stopped in for a quick afternoon bite and was pleased . <sssss> some good sub options , although nothing overly creative . <sssss> however , fast , fresh , and vastly preferable to subway . <sssss> free wi-fi made it a great place to sit for a bit , do a little email , and grab a sandwich . 
4		i like big 5 . <sssss> this location is right next door to my house so i come here a lot . <sssss> it 's a great place to run into when you need something last minute before a camping trip or a bike ride or something -lrb- i 've bought several replacement bladder things for my camelbak here -rrb- . <sssss> the staff has always been helpful and friendly and you can also buy passes for the tonto national forest here if you are going camping for 6 bucks a piece . <sssss> it 's no bass pro shop , but it still gets the job done for your basic outdoor needs . 
4		i have visited the casey jones pub 3 times over the past year or so whenever i visit my mother who lives in phoenix . <sssss> everytime i go i have had a great time ! <sssss> take for instance this past weekend , they had ufc 116 on for free . <sssss> not many places in california even show the fights and they definitely are not free ! <sssss> also after 10 p.m they have $ 1.50 small pitchers of domestics . <sssss> sooo that speaks for itself !! <sssss> the food is typical barfood but it is very good so you ca n't go wrong there . <sssss> i will continue to go here whenever i come to phoenix !! 
4		oh man , i gained 5 pounds on sunday but since it was from joe 's i do n't even really care - it was that good . <sssss> i wo n't go into the local ingredients , agritopia , etc since others already have but it is a wonderful thing . <sssss> more below . <sssss> the food was awesome . <sssss> very fresh , delicious and wholesome - you actually felt like you were eating food that was also good for you . <sssss> granted we just had the burgers and ice cream but there 's a whole menu there to explore on future visits . <sssss> i loved the signature burger with pesto & fontina , neither of which i had ever thought of but worked very well . <sssss> the onion rings were good , as were the milkshakes and sundae . <sssss> it really fills you up fast though , so try to pace yourself ! <sssss> i was equally enchanted with the setting . <sssss> beautiful place . <sssss> just like a farm oasis in the midst of suburbia - i hope it does n't vanish in the midst of the houses all around it . <sssss> even the bathroom was noteworthy - clean , black and white with dolls and a closed circuit tv . <sssss> it reminded me of the jetsons - you know , the 60s idea of space age . <sssss> sitting outside was n't too hot , as it 's the one place i 've seen so far where the misters really work and do n't just spray you and puddle down . <sssss> the only down side was when i asked where the farm stand was and the cashier pointed it out , but without mentioning it was closed . <sssss> nor was there a sign at the actual location indicating when it would be open in the fall . <sssss> oh , and what was really nice was the sense of everyone relaxing - just kicking back and having a good time . <sssss> definitely worth going to again , and again ... 
4		i really enjoyed lisa g 's . <sssss> i went with a bunch of other yelp-he 's and yelp-she 's after the last oye and was pleasantly surprised . <sssss> i have driven by several times and i love the logo and the sign , and used to live within walking distance , so it was on my list of places to visit . <sssss> i love the fact that lisa g is bopping around taking care of business . <sssss> i think that people who actually participate in the day-to-day operations of their business are doing it right . <sssss> everyone was really pleased with their meals , and i really enjoyed the taste of pizza i stole from my neighboring yelp-she . <sssss> i am definitely looking forward to hitting lisa g 's again and trying out some more tasty treats ! 
4		great chinese restaurant . <sssss> ate in friday night . <sssss> we always start with the sizzling rice soup . <sssss> excellent . <sssss> followed with sweet and sour chicken and the neptune 's platter which is brought sizzling to the table side . <sssss> food tasted fresh and well prepared . <sssss> delicious . <sssss> service is prompt , attentive and friendly . <sssss> highly recommended . 
4		would have been five stars if the service had been better . <sssss> for a saturday night pretty empty so was surprised to see it take a while to get service . <sssss> food was fantastic as usual ! 
4		i discovered this place about 11 years ago when we made our first trip to phoenix . <sssss> i had been to a few big outlet malls like grapevine mills and knew that this could be a decent place to find a bargain . <sssss> sure enough i did and i have been coming back every since . <sssss> my favorite store is by far penney 's . <sssss> the quality is usually good and the prices are sometimes unbelievable . <sssss> it seems that they have a large selection of just about everything from household items like bath towels and bed sheets , but they also have a large selection of clothing for the entire family . <sssss> i know that as long as i keep finding good prices and the quality stays up , i 'll keep coming back . 
4		a friend and i went to teds hot dogs on a friday evening , it was both of ours 1st time there and we were not disappointed . <sssss> we too have to say ted 's hot dogs are among the best in the valley and how lucky are we to have ted 's out of his 7 locations , mostly being in the new york area , we have one in tempe az ! <sssss> once you walk in you see where the line is forming , do n't be alarmed , it 's really not a slow moving line , once in line you place your order you can c watch your dog -lrb- or burger , but really who goes to a hot dog joint to order a burger ? -rrb- <sssss> cooking on a grill , getting plump and nice grill marks on them ! <sssss> then once it is cooked , you will be asked what you want on it , now the chili cheese dog did look great but i went for an all-beef hot dog with mayo -lrb- that 's how i like it -rrb- sliced pickles , grilled onions & peppers ! <sssss> boy o boy was it good !! <sssss> my friend ordered the foot long dog with chili . <sssss> we also got some french fries & their freshly handmade onion rings , which were very good . <sssss> they have other types of dogs on the overhead menu , brats , polish , white ? <sssss> , and reg dogs and the foot long & all beef . <sssss> next time i will try the polish dog ! 
4		we stopped in at the keg for dinner and had a splendid time . <sssss> service was prompt and efficient . <sssss> the food was splendidly done . <sssss> we had the goat cheese appetizer and were very pleased with the baked cheese flavors . <sssss> the salad 's greens were crisp and not overly covered in dressing . <sssss> the vegetables were crisp and not overcooked . <sssss> i ordered a rare filet . <sssss> it was a wonderfully done rare when it arrived . <sssss> the only thing that could have made it better was more blood . <sssss> my spouse ordered the filet and crab . <sssss> each was done perfectly . <sssss> the big surprise was the coffee was as good the creme brulee -lrb- not so last time -rrb- . <sssss> i highly recommend the keg as an alternative to more pricey alternatives -lrb- ruth 's chris and morton 's -rrb- . 
4		tucked away at camelback & 3rd is the sun up brewing company . <sssss> armed with a need for some food & adult beverage we made our way inside this cozy pub packed with people . <sssss> with all the great dishes on the menu it was very hard to choose . <sssss> but when we finally did the food was great -lrb- not your regular pub fare -rrb- and all the beers were wonderful ... especially the vanilla porter . <sssss> i will definitely be back for another round of food and drinks ! 
4		for less than $ 7 you get a large pepperoni and a side of killer bread sticks . <sssss> this place is cheap , fast , and good , a rare combo . <sssss> plus if you have leftover pesos from your last mexican vacation you can buy pizza with them . 
4		really a pretty sweet rock shop , especially considering it 's out of the way in such a small town . <sssss> the owner keeps a very nice selection of specimens , all clearly tagged with mineral content , origin and price , divided into those less than $ 10 , and those more than $ 10 -lrb- found in a case , by and large -rrb- . <sssss> nothing super unusual , but considering what passes for selection in some of the more urban rock outlets . <sssss> items are reasonably priced besides . <sssss> of particular interest is a variety of fluorite carvings . <sssss> i do n't know where this stock is coming from , but it 's gorgeous and i wish i could afford much more ! <sssss> the owner also seems to come by some exceptional aquamarine . <sssss> of course , if you ca n't find what you 're looking for , the staff will generally oblige you with a hunt through the boxes of spare items kept under the shelves . <sssss> also available are small tumbled rocks for the kids , quite a lot of jewelry - mineral-based an otherwise - and a small selection of more touristy trappings . <sssss> certainly worth a stop if you happen to be at the sundial . 
4		-lsb- solid 3.5 stars -rsb- not your ordinary tamales . <sssss> these are large moist and fresh . <sssss> i first encountered them at the phoenix public market on saturdays and occasionally on first fridays , with steamers full of a variety of tamale flavors to please the vegan , vegeterian and meat lover alike . <sssss> with fillings from traditional pork red chile and beef red chile to spinach mushroom , shrimp , chicken -lrb- red or green -rrb- or my favorite green chile , corn with cream cheese . <sssss> you have to check out their menu of choices they always seem to have something new or seasonal . <sssss> they have them warm in steamers or frozen to take home for later . <sssss> -lsb- they defrost and reheat very well . <sssss> reheat in the wrap or wrap a moist paper towel over the wrapped tamale to ensure it wo n't dry out . -rsb- <sssss> a fan of their moist delicious fluffy masa , i am not a fan of the shrimp tamale i had and the tamale traditionalist part of me found that the pork red chile had too much cumin for my flavor . <sssss> i can always count on the goodness of the green corn tamale -lrb- corn , green chile and cream cheese -rrb- . <sssss> when i forget to pick up a few on saturday i can always find them in the freezer at phoenix public market . 
4		cool atmosphere , awesome mix of people and its super close for me . 
4		we hiked up cholla trail and it was one of the best experiences ever ! <sssss> great views and a great workout / challenge . <sssss> bring water ! <sssss> only bad thing was parking , which was about .5 mile away . <sssss> not a big deal at all really . <sssss> definitely go ! 
4		solid food , awesome beer , fast , helpful staff . <sssss> i 've never had a problem with four peaks . <sssss> i would have given it five stars , but i hate -lrb- hate hate hate hate !!!! -rrb- <sssss> red onions and a few too many of their entreés include them . 
4		i was really impressed with this walgreens ! <sssss> i went out of my way to go there because it is the closest location to me with a take care clinic inside . <sssss> the entire store is newly remodeled . <sssss> the shelves are all back lit . <sssss> the pharmacy and the clinic have monitors to show you queue of people waiting for service . <sssss> this way you know if they are working on your script or it will show you when it is done and ready to be picked up . <sssss> the monitor for the clinic shows the estimated wait time . <sssss> there is also a section with deli foods and snacks that looked fresh and healthy . <sssss> the only problem is that the wait between being seen at the clinic an getting the script filled was very long . <sssss> i 've also been to a cvs minute clinic and they put the scripts from the clinic ahead of everyone else as a courtesy . <sssss> i wish walgreens would learn to adopt this policy . 
4		pretty damned good vegan and vegetarian food for not a whole lot of green . <sssss> courteous and attentive staff . <sssss> solid music choices at an acceptable volume level . <sssss> kind of limited menu , but hey they 've also got cruelty free pies . <sssss> space is also limited , but that just makes it easier for me to get work done while i wait for the delectables to arrive at the table . 
4		as far as chill coffee shops go , three roots is at the top of my list . <sssss> it has a very laid back atmosphere . <sssss> there is always pretty good music playing and cool local artwork featured . <sssss> i like the mix of different tables , couches and chairs that gives the place a cozy vibe . <sssss> it can get a little crowded there and is not always the best place for quiet studying but is a nice place to hang out with friends . <sssss> they even have a few board games . <sssss> i am not a big coffee drinker but they do have a good assortment of teas , and i especially like their chai . <sssss> i have also tried the veggie burger which was pretty good . <sssss> overall if you are looking for a cute coffee shop to hang out at i definitely recommend three roots . 
4		had lunch of soup and sandwich here and it was delicious ! <sssss> my co-workers had bruschetta board and charcuterie/olive board . <sssss> both looked like something i 'd like to try next visit . <sssss> i 'll be back . 
4		this little gem was another great find in phoenix . <sssss> between this and all about comics , i was pleased with the selections available . <sssss> the pros : 1 . <sssss> conveniently located on camelback road , however , it 's at the end of large complex and could be easy to miss . <sssss> plenty of parking available in a lot behind the building . <sssss> 2 . <sssss> a nice selection of comics , specifically current ones . <sssss> i was also impressed by the staff recommendations rack to let you know what the employees are reading and if they like it . <sssss> as for the staff , very friendly and they discuss issue you buy , etc. . <sssss> imagine that , great customer service . <sssss> on major impression was one of the employees went out of her way to look for a comic that was out of print there -lrb- batman incorporated # 8 , a major seller -rrb- . <sssss> she called a number of other places , even competitors . <sssss> shows that there 's good camaraderie with other stores . <sssss> they had a good number of variants and a few collectible figures . <sssss> their focus is definitely on comics and games . <sssss> i definitely dig the idea of comic packs to help a new collector catch up on a series . <sssss> i was tickled by the dc casualties section as well . <sssss> 3 . <sssss> a major plus ! <sssss> they sponsor games at this spot , mainly the card based variety . <sssss> this was very cool and fosters the culture associated with comics . <sssss> i was really impressed with how friendly everyone was as well , whether you 're a pro or a newcomer . <sssss> the cons : 1 . <sssss> this is a relatively small place , so do n't expect a monster selection . <sssss> not much in terms of figurines , but i did see some items that peaked my interest . <sssss> however , they had a fantastic selection of comics from other publishers . <sssss> by that i mean other than dc , marvel , dark horse , idw , etc and as mentioned before will go the extra mile to help their customers . <sssss> 2 . <sssss> as stated before , it can be easy to miss if you 're not paying attention . <sssss> no parking in the front at all . <sssss> you have to park behind the building . <sssss> not really a con , just a pointer for people . <sssss> overall , samurai become a regular stop for me each week when i was going to the local ymca to exercise . <sssss> i highly recommend supporting this place . <sssss> i wish i had asked about the tools that were banned from the place . <sssss> their pictures are posted by the register . 
4		i stumbled upon goodytwo 's adorable little shop while wandering the agua caliente plaza . <sssss> the bright green umbrellas on the patio and the shop sign featuring silhouettes of the owners are elements that are just too cute for words and drew me in . <sssss> inside , you 're immediately overwhelmed by the sugary , delicious smell of freshly made sweets . <sssss> the displays and packaging are all very beautifully done - precious little gift bags filled with squares of toffee , boxes of twoozles snack mix , toffee-laden jars adorned with bows in their signature green , and apothecary jars stuffed with samples . <sssss> this is the important part : they have an amazing sample bar along the left side of the store featuring all of the different types of toffee available . <sssss> you could od on sugary goodness by making your way through each type -lrb- i think that there were about 7 or 8 to try -rrb- however i was able to contain myself and kept it to just two for this visit - the nutty twist , which features white chocolate and toffee made with tequila and a twist of lime ... there was a tiny bit of kick but overall a good flavor without too much tequilaness - and a new type -lrb- it is not on their website , so i do n't have the proper name -rrb- which featured white chocolate and a hint of lavender with the toffee ... it was my favorite , and i purchased a 2x2 '' square of it for four fifty to share with my husband . <sssss> which brings me to my next point : price . <sssss> it was definitely on the pricy side for a tiny treat , but perhaps it works for the scottsdale crowd who would frequent this shop . <sssss> the jars were pretty small and cost $ 8.99 , the bags of toffee -lrb- which contained 4 squares -rrb- were $ 18.50 -lrb- i think -rrb- and the twoozles were somewhere around $ 9 or $ 10 per box . <sssss> goodytwos is not inexpensive by any means , but the quality was certainly there and it is obvious that they use top notch ingredients and well styled packaging . <sssss> i can see their toffee as a perfect addition to a lovely gift basket , or even a standalone hostess gift or party favor . <sssss> the saleslady there was super sweet and talkative and i could n't allow myself to leave without buying something after she was so kind , so she did her job well ! <sssss> this was a fun find and i 'll definitely head back the next time have a little extra cash and the excuse for a sweet treat . 
4		very nice and a bit confusing , not too much but just a bit ! 
4		the herb box is good . <sssss> for brunch , the salmon hash is an awesome combination of wonderful breakfast foods . <sssss> i especially liked that it had the fingerling potatoes mixed in . <sssss> but really , you can put potatoes in anything and i 'll like it . <sssss> today , i had lunch at the herb box , and was pleasantly surprised with their fish taco special . <sssss> seriously , i did n't expect tacos this good at a place with such varied food styles as the herb box . <sssss> what keeps me from giving the herb box that final star are the prices and service . <sssss> the food is good , but just a few bucks more than what i usually want to spend . <sssss> the service is n't awful , but it has that slightly snobbish scottsdale vibe . <sssss> little things like that make me want to stay in central phoenix and out of downtown scottsdale . 
4		it was one hot afternoon , the boyfriend wanted to take me check out how scottsdale was and so he did . <sssss> we happen to come across yard house in the mall . <sssss> the patio was sort of outside of where cars were getting valet parking . <sssss> might be a bit noisy for others but hey , not bad to check out fancy cars . <sssss> :-rrb- after a long walk , we decided to come here for the happy hour and man was it worth it . <sssss> we started it off with two half yards , one eclipse -lrb- blue moon & guinness -rrb- and one guinness . <sssss> we thought we were n't going to finish it but it made us feel hungry so we got some appetizers on their happy hour menu . <sssss> the hawaiian poke stack was yummy , that is if you can eat raw sushi . <sssss> it looks like a burger but they stack it with poke and use fried won-ton strips to separate the poke , avocados and ginger . <sssss> i think they mixed the poke with some soy sauce and sesame oil . <sssss> it was good . <sssss> then we got seared ahi sashimi . <sssss> -lrb- yes , we are into our sushi rawness -rrb- small portion , theres maybe about 5 slices at most , and some greens on the side . <sssss> not bad . <sssss> i think it is only worth it for happy hour price . <sssss> appettizers happy hour price - seared ahi sashimi -lrb- reg : $ 11.95 -rrb- $ 5.95 - hawaiian poke stack -lrb- reg : $ 12.95 -rrb- - $ 6.50 drinks happy hour -lrb- half yards -rrb- - $ 7 - $ 10 - eclipse -lrb- blue moon & guinness -rrb- - guinness check out the website . <sssss> http://www.yardhouse.com/happyhour/default.aspx course i would go to yard house again , for the happy hour : -rrb- 
4		i would give 3.5 stars , but ca n't so i am giving the bacchanal 4 stars . <sssss> i recently tried this place out while at a birthday dinner for a hockey buddy . <sssss> there were 12 of us sitting at a u-shaped table , which was nice since everyone could talk to everyone . <sssss> well , we could if we were n't right next to the band , but oh well . <sssss> i think the appeal for this place is definitely the atmosphere . <sssss> it is almost like a show where they serve food and alcohol , as opposed to a restaurant . <sssss> there is one older greek dude with two lazy eyes who kind of mc 's the `` event '' . <sssss> you can really only understand every fourth word he says , but at least it is somewhat authentic . <sssss> the band was good , with a rag-tag group of greek gentleman . <sssss> although the drummer reminded me of big pussy from the sopranos . <sssss> a belly dancer came out and fell in love with my buddy peter . <sssss> he was in love too , i think . <sssss> you also get to throw ceramic plates onto the dance floor and yell opa ! <sssss> the food was decent , nothing spectacular . <sssss> i had a baked halibut fillet with a lemon bechemel sauce . <sssss> it came with potatoes and vegetables . <sssss> the veggies were a little disappointing . <sssss> they obviously were n't fresh , most likely canned . <sssss> we did try the calamari , which was good . <sssss> they have stella ! <sssss> this made me happy . <sssss> overall the party had a great time , but i do n't think anyone was blown away by the food . <sssss> the same strange lazy-eyed greek gentleman shook everyones hand on the way out . <sssss> that was nice , but i ended up smelling like whatever cologne he had just taken a bath in . 
4		this was my first time there and it was really nice ! <sssss> i was there for the angels vs. rangers game on march 24th . <sssss> the ushers were real nice and helpful . <sssss> oh and parking was free ! 
4		lunch special is the best deal . <sssss> pizza with salad or pasta with salad . <sssss> you should defintely try their mista salad and their penne pasta with asparagus and white sauce , it 's delicious . <sssss> their pizza is also good , my choice is the margherita . <sssss> service is good . 
4		pleasantly surprised . <sssss> stopped in for lunch today and got their pizza by the slice . <sssss> now usually when you go to a pizza place and get the pizza by the slice it is dry and has that `` been sitting under a heat lamp for 4 hours '' taste . <sssss> this pizza did not . <sssss> it was just the right temp , the pepperoni was perfectly crispy -lrb- a huge plus for me -rrb- and there was an awesome amount of cheese compared to sauce -lrb- not big on sauce in general , so i am always happy to find a place that does n't drown the pie in sauce -rrb- . <sssss> grabbed some ranch for the crust . <sssss> . <sssss> the ranch was a great consistency and had nice season to it . <sssss> i 'd go back . 
4		best tree fort in old town , and you can take the mugs home if you get a moscow mule ! 
4		this grocery has hands down the nicest , most hard working , friendly produce clerk -lrb- nights -rrb- i have ever bumped into while shopping . 
4		three of us dined . <sssss> i had a whole roasted chicken with mashed potatoes and grilled veggies was excellent . <sssss> of course , i could not eat a whole thing . <sssss> my son really enjoyed ravioli w / tasty sauce . <sssss> my wife had crab cakes which was good . <sssss> our waiter was very friendly and attentive . <sssss> do i go back again ? <sssss> yes , definitely . 
4		i come here every time i 'm in scottsdale , and i always get the same thing : smoked chicken chile rellenos . <sssss> the chicken is clean and the smokey flavor is just the right intensity . <sssss> the chile itself is cooked to perfection , but it still has the right amount of juice , and the delicious mix of nuts and apricots inside really takes it to the next level . <sssss> add all this together with a great cream sauce on top and you have one fantastic chile relleno . <sssss> but be sure to bring a little extra green to z'tejas , it 's a little on the pricier side but definitely worth it . 
4		i 've been a member at this ymca for about 6 months . <sssss> before that i 've tried many big box gyms like la fitness and ballys . <sssss> this place is definitely different than those other gyms . <sssss> first the good stuff : for everything they offer , it 's pretty affordable . <sssss> i love that i have never have a problem finding a treadmill -lrb- even at peak hours -rrb- , there are no time limits on the cardio machines , and each treadmill has an individual tv screen with all the basic cable channels . <sssss> if you are a techie like me , you can also download tv shows and movies to your ipod or iphone watch them on the treadmill 's tv via an apple specific adapter . <sssss> personally , i have not tried any of the classes , but there are tons -lrb- there are 2 studios -rrb- and they are n't all offered in the middle of the work day like a lot of the gyms i had previously belonged to . <sssss> i 've been doing weight training with teri , a personal trainer there for the last several months and have really enjoyed the experience . <sssss> she 's extremely knowledgeable and encouraging . <sssss> the personal training is also very affordable . <sssss> the not so great stuff : if you have kids , you 're probably going to think this gym is awesome . <sssss> however , i do not have kids and i usually find myself wading through big crowds of children just to get to the locker room and then again on the way to the exercise room . <sssss> many times there unsupervised children running around , screaming and playing in the small locker room , which i find slightly -lrb- ok , really -rrb- annoying . <sssss> the weight area of the gym is can be crowded during the hours of 5:30 - 7 pm when i am there . <sssss> this was more apparent in the summer , now that it is winter time it seems to be less of a problem . <sssss> finding parking can be a problem , though there is another lot near by , you just have to walk a little farther . <sssss> the locker room is usually a mess with puddles and clutter . <sssss> i think my usual workout time must coincide with the youth swim team . <sssss> those kids must not be too concerned about their stuff being stolen because they leave their bags and and backpacks out all over the benches . <sssss> there are only 3 toilets in there and it seems like half the lockers do n't have a working latch that can be locked . <sssss> finally , they are usually closed on holiday weekends . <sssss> in the winter i do n't mind this -lrb- since i can get in an workout outside -rrb- , but in the summer months it kills me . 
4		kids eat free on wed and now also sundays with specific adult purchase ! <sssss> the white pizzas are fantastic !! <sssss> mmmmmm . <sssss> the kids get slices -lrb- as a kids meal -rrb- and the cheese ones are good , too . <sssss> the seasonal salads have been wonderful -- current one i think is called strawberry fields ? <sssss> it has nice greens , almond slices , strawberries , apples , cheese , and 2 different dressings . <sssss> got the calzone last night -- not recommended . <sssss> the large -lrb- i ordered a small and she made a mistake -rrb- was huge -- large enough for about 5 or 6 people , unless everyone has a huge appetite for a lotta carbs . <sssss> the dough was uncooked on the inside , and the broccoli and chicken were cold :-lrb- . <sssss> i guess that process needs some work . <sssss> at this particular location , there 's always a gal that greets us and keeps calling us `` guys '' in every sentence . <sssss> it 's just a little weird , but the rest of the staff is great . <sssss> again with this place , like at china king , never sure why there does n't seem to be many people eating in . <sssss> they do deliver , so maybe lots of ppl have delivery ? <sssss> they do have patio seating with misters , but right now , kinda hot to eat outside . <sssss> probably lovely in the cooler weather . <sssss> kids meals come with a small sundae , so that makes them happy . <sssss> the fountain drinks are pepsi . <sssss> the diet pepsi tastes bad , and the diet dr pepper does n't taste much better . <sssss> they do , however , have filtered water . <sssss> your choice of filtered nyc water -lrb- tastes great ! -rrb- <sssss> or filtered chandler water . <sssss> btw this location is in the same plaza where outback , nordstrom rack , famous footwear , sas , etc are , so the parking is a little cramped . <sssss> not much nypd can do about that , but it 's annoying . 
4		great place . <sssss> owner represents well . <sssss> ordered the philly with jalapeños , mushrooms , red and green peppers !!! <sssss> bread is delivered daily . <sssss> very impressive . <sssss> we will be back . <sssss> lots of ice cream choices ! <sssss> not a lot of seating but very friendly staff . <sssss> my wife 's response is `` i 've found my new sandwich place ! '' 
4		i had the pleasure of interviewing brian lester yesterday over a pretty good cappuccino . <sssss> the cafe offers a coffee and espresso bar with wonderful baked goods too . <sssss> an outside seating area with bike racks in the works . <sssss> and a decent size dining hall . <sssss> the owners plan to offer a take-out option in addition to the cafe 's sit-down service . <sssss> `` you 'll get items here you wo n't get anywhere else . <sssss> and we want to participate in the the roosevelt row art walk events . <sssss> as the restaurant develops , so will many other aspects of squash blossom such as artwork , changes in hours and charity events . <sssss> a display wall will be dedicated for local artists to showcase their work . '' <sssss> he said . <sssss> brian also spoke on his and his wife 's plans to be actively involved in the roosevelt row merchants association and the downtown phoenix partnership . <sssss> they also plan to become a part of local first arizona , a nonprofit organization that supports local business and products . <sssss> as for my contribution as a local artist , i would love to begin hanging my photography in this very cozy restaurant . <sssss> anyway , brian invited me back to try a meal . <sssss> thank you . <sssss> looking forward to it and once again congratulations . <sssss> l also had the opportunity to speak with the chief and i liked what i heard . <sssss> the house opens to the public on monday july23 . 
4		the original burrito co. is quickly becoming my favorite burrito place . <sssss> the owner came to eat at the restaurant i work at and she told me to come by and try this place out and being a huge fan of mexican food i had to go . <sssss> the burritos are really huge and really well priced . <sssss> i love the california burrito with chicken , add guacamole . <sssss> the chicken is so moist and tender . <sssss> i have tried the carne asada as well , but when i got it it was full of cilantro and jalapenos , which were just overbearing , but i 'm thinking it could have been a bad day and will have to try it again . <sssss> downside for me would be that the salsa is not spicy at all . <sssss> it tastes very good , but i am a huge fan of spicy , especially on mexican food , and its a bummer for me when a place does not offer a very spicy salsa . 
4		i picked up my friend for lunch and headed to local breeze . <sssss> it has been on my to do list for a couple of months . <sssss> we sat in the shade under their patio and were cooled by a nice breeze . <sssss> how appropriate . <sssss> i ordered the atomic burger . <sssss> the menu boasts that it will clear your sinus with its pepper jack cheese and horseradish . <sssss> did it ever . <sssss> i had to pace myself when eating this burger . <sssss> i ate a little to quickly at one point and gagged on the strong horseradish . <sssss> for my side i ordered a salad with a lime dressing . <sssss> the greens were so fresh and the dressing was enjoyable . <sssss> my friend ordered the veggie sandwich and was happy with her choice . <sssss> local breeze has a nice atmosphere . <sssss> the waitstaff was attentive and pleasant . <sssss> i will go back and i will try something else . <sssss> i did enjoy my burger do n't get me wrong . <sssss> something with a little less burn next time . <sssss> 4 stars . 
4		love this little spot in phoenix . <sssss> saying you went to dick 's hideaway is almost like bragging that you know how to get there . <sssss> it 's tucked away in this little strip mall and it has maybe 3 tables and a bar you can sit at . <sssss> went for breakfast and we had the huevos rancheros and the meatloaf . <sssss> we were so full and had food leftover . <sssss> nice place to take a gf/bf for brunch . 
4		fantastic local shop filled with all unique clothes . <sssss> i purchased a necklace which i have n't taken off since . <sssss> i will be back to see whats new on pay day . <sssss> the owner is a sweet gal who was very friendly and helpful . <sssss> if you love fashion and want to enjoy some local fun visit bunky boutique . 
4		my folks went here when they were kids and they took me here all my life to . <sssss> the ice cream is great . <sssss> they have been in the vally since 1952 , i believe and they had two other locations . <sssss> the location they are in now is the newest one and the other two are no longer in buisness . <sssss> they have lots of different toppings and ice cream combinations . <sssss> the also have two huge ice cream platters . <sssss> the hill and the mountain . <sssss> the hill is 6 lbs of ice cream and the mountain is 8 lbs of ice cream . <sssss> you pic the kinds of ice cream you want and the topping . <sssss> both are huge and both i have conqured . <sssss> i went here for a few birthday partys when i was a kid and took them both down . <sssss> yeah yeah ! <sssss> anyway the also have a few food items . <sssss> the coyl club is awsome . <sssss> i get it on marble rye and it comes with ham , turkey , lettus , tomato , and cheese . <sssss> its a tripple decker and i get the potato salad wich is delicious to . <sssss> they have a killer blt which has 12 pices of bacon on it . <sssss> omg it so good . <sssss> i have to say the food prices are good but the ice cream althou it is freakin delicious it is a little pricey . <sssss> i go here cause i grew up going here and i do love it so ill pay the high price for the ice cream , i know i wont be disapointed . 
4		i will have to admit that i was not a huge fan of the keg , as i have been to the chandler mall location and i was not impressed . <sssss> i was hesitant to try the new location at the san tan mall , but i tried it anyway . <sssss> i have been there 3 times in the last 3 months , and i am glad that i did . <sssss> i thought the waitstaff was excellent and very helpful every time i went there , and their menu has some really great choices . <sssss> the bar was very nice and clean and the outside patio is pretty awesome . <sssss> if you go during the cooler months , they have a nice fireplace and comfortable seating . <sssss> the prices are similar to outback , but the food is far better . <sssss> i will be returning . 
4		a little different than what i 'm used to but , i love gina 's class . 
4		we had an excellent lunch here . <sssss> our server mariah was very helpful and informative , and everyone enjoyed their food : chillaquilles , fish sandwich , burrito , chicken quesadilla - all excellent ! 
4		good stuff , this is what mexican food dreams about !! <sssss> took my folks in for late lunch one day , hit it right on time as we were seated right away and then the line formed . <sssss> the best : the guacamole , made at your table with pomagranites ... the really really good : pescado delmar . <sssss> . <sssss> outstanding shrimp , crab fish all cooked perfectly . <sssss> the only down side is once you treat your self to this outstanding meal , the bill comes and it is a little pricy . <sssss> will we be back ... yes its worth it 
4		not much to say here that has n't being said . <sssss> pj is my staple restaurant for fresh , healthy mediterranean inspired food . <sssss> avoid if you do n't like crowds though , it 's almost always busy . 
4		i used to frequent legends when it went by coach & willies . <sssss> not much has changed about the place though i no longer see the dbombs drink advertised . <sssss> legends is a great place to get yummy food before or after a diamondbacks game . <sssss> i love the italian nachos -lrb- pizza in nacho form ... my god , genius -rrb- . <sssss> it 's a nice clean bar with lots of wood , and a very nice outdoor patio with lots of bougainvillea and misters . 
4		oh boy was i excited when i first walked into rosie mccaffrey 's . <sssss> an irish pub right down the street ? <sssss> this place was a godsend disguised as a local drunken hotspot . <sssss> apparently , it was n't disguised at all . <sssss> it really is just a local drunken hotspot . <sssss> i 've been a moderate patron of rosies for the past few months now , and while this is my usual watering hole of choice , there are a few things that need to be said about it . <sssss> first of all , the beer selection is good . <sssss> it is n't yardhouse by a longshot , but the choices are varied for different tastes and income brackets . <sssss> the food is good for bar fare . <sssss> i felt much like a irish local grazing the fields of greasy confections , i could literally feel my alcohol tolerance increasing with each bite . <sssss> the service is good , but prepare to wait if the place fills up -lrb- which it does -rrb- and you 'll get looked over if you do n't have cleavage -lrb- which i do n't -rrb- but it helps if you 're on a first name basis with the staff -lrb- which i am -rrb- . <sssss> the music is varied , which is nice . <sssss> on the nights where live music is playing , you 'll get a spattering of irish folk music or recent covers . <sssss> i 'm a fan of a few bands that play there , but to be completely honest , there have only been a few occasions where i 've found my toes tapping . <sssss> but it 's lively and fun , pleasant to listen to while you inebriate yourself . <sssss> you 'll find a wide range of characters that frequent rosies , though . <sssss> from the bar rats , greased woman hunters , drunken floozies , haughty better-than-alls and down home boys , there is never a lack of people to talk to . <sssss> i ca n't guarantee a good experience , but who can ? <sssss> but i would n't worry , if you 're using the place as you should , you wo n't remember tomorrow morning anyway . <sssss> no matter it 's flaws , rosie mccaffery 's is worth a visit at least . <sssss> grab a bite , take a shot of irish courage and mix it up with a stranger . <sssss> if you see a fellow standing to the side , people watching with a silent amused smirk , come and say hello . <sssss> i probably wo n't bite . 
4		this place is an oldie but goodie . <sssss> not the trendiest restaurant -lrb- any more -rrb- . <sssss> back in the day , the placement of the bathrooms and the fact that the dj was on the second floor spinning was mind blowing ! <sssss> now it is populated more by folks who were walking around the mall and wanted a place to eat . <sssss> this is not a bad thing at all . <sssss> i used to feel like i have dress to the nines to come here . <sssss> now i do n't get as stressed coming in . <sssss> the drinks are still great . <sssss> strong and well executed . <sssss> do n't miss the pimms cup by the way . <sssss> only hanny 's does a similar one and i think az 88 executes it better . <sssss> they have mini hot fudge sundaes which make me super happy . <sssss> the food is standard and filling . <sssss> overall , i think i might need to put this back in the rotation . 
4		i usually order the afghani - spicy turkey . <sssss> i put everything on it and every minute of it is delicious . <sssss> worth mentioning is their ice tea . <sssss> its brewed . <sssss> not that brisk/syrup and water bullshizz i 've been seeing everywhere . <sssss> and its yummy ! <sssss> they usually have two types to choose from . <sssss> a black tea and a jasmine green tea -lrb- i think -rrb- . <sssss> i always bring a book with me since its usually a bit of a wait -lrb- 5-10mins -rrb- , especially during lunch . <sssss> but i 've never had a meal there that did n't warrant that . <sssss> bonus : the employees are nice and friendly and the people that frequent the spot are well mannered folk who at the very least , are entertaining to watch . 
4		i really have to gush about this place ! <sssss> i had a business meeting , and we were supposed to meet at the merc . <sssss> their signage was completely wrong and they never opened when they said they were going to . <sssss> so , we walked around the corner and saw fuego tacos . <sssss> i 've been to the bistro once , so i knew it was a safe place to go . <sssss> it was just after 5 and the place was about half-full downstairs . <sssss> i noticed the upstairs was empty . <sssss> i asked if we could sit up there and we were given our choice of tables . <sssss> our server was amazing ! <sssss> he immediately brought us chips and salsa and took our drink orders . <sssss> he brought me two drinks ! <sssss> i 'm ok with that , because usually i 'm used to having servers who do n't keep up with my drinks . <sssss> -lrb- diet coke , fyi -rrb- the chips were freshly made , and the salsa was good . <sssss> we ordered a plate of nachos to share with pork on top . <sssss> it 's one of the best plates of nachos i 've had in a very long time . <sssss> we all devoured them . <sssss> as i was getting up to leave , our server brought me a diet coke in a to-go cup . <sssss> i did n't even ask for it but wow ! <sssss> i 'm going back , most definitely . <sssss> the prices were reasonable and there was a good crowd in there . <sssss> oh , and they were playing 80s music . <sssss> that pretty much gives the place 500 cool points . 
4		i would bring a date here ! <sssss> the food is cajun style with that new orleans motif for decor . <sssss> the service was on point -lrb- good -rrb- , and seating was more than adequate ! <sssss> we asked for beads to darn on ourselves -- and they brought us some ! <sssss> the food is spicy as is cajun style and the selections are terrific . <sssss> they serve alcohol and other libations ... the location is a bit outside of phoenix proper , but if you are looking for that cajun effect -- this is a good place to start . <sssss> as a bonus , they gave us a gift card for $ 5 off our next visit ... this was a nice evening to say the least ... i recommend it . <sssss> four stars : one for decor , one for how the food tasted ! <sssss> one for service , and one for price -lrb- reasonable -rrb- . 
4		a lot of folks bag on chain restaurant and generally , i am one of those folks , but macayo 's remains consistent and tasty . <sssss> it 's kind of like a friend-with-benefits . <sssss> you 're never getting married but every time you hook up , you know exactly what you 're going to get . 
4		i ended up coming here 2 days in a row for various reasons . <sssss> the first time i came here it reminded me of a restaurant that you would see in las vegas . <sssss> nice decor and clean - just made me wish i was dressed up and inebriated though . <sssss> the food is pretty good -- i 've had their chicken sandwich and salad . <sssss> the portions are huge -- even their plates and forks are huge ... why ? <sssss> do n't think i would come here again by choice , but i certainly would n't mind if i ended up here again : -rrb- 
4		i went back to viet kitchen yesterday to see if i would like it any better and i went armed with my own soup spoon . <sssss> result : muuuuuuch better dining experience . <sssss> :-rrb- i 'm ready to go again . <sssss> who 's all up for it ? 
4		ordered the navaho triple beef taco to go for my dinner a few hours later . <sssss> this 3 meat frybread is a good choice if you would to sample each of the beef options in one meal . <sssss> although my request that the cold vegetable items be placed on the side for reheating purposes went ignored , i will try again . <sssss> hopefully , they will get it right as it is a pain picking the lettuce , onions and tomatoes off to reheat when i am ready to eat and it makes a mess of the taco . 
4		this little cafe , hidden at mesa gateway airport , was quite a surprising little find . <sssss> i attend chandler-gilbert college across the street , so for days when i forget my lunch , this is a wonderfully convenient place to grab a quick bite . <sssss> yes , i said quick ! <sssss> i received my order in an exceptionally timely manner , which was great and allowed me plenty of time to make it to my next class without running on a full stomach ! <sssss> i had the `` albatross '' fish sandwich , and it was very good . <sssss> the portions and quality are very reasonable for the price , and the service was good too . <sssss> this cafe was pretty cool , lots of decorations . <sssss> plus , you get to watch the airplanes take off and land . <sssss> i 'll definitely be returning . <sssss> overall , everything was excellent , and i 'd recommend it to anyone for a quiet lunch spot . 
4		good and unique . 
4		lived across the street from here for almost 10 years and never thought to stop in . <sssss> well , last night i visited for the 1st time with a group of girl scout moms . <sssss> wow ! <sssss> i 've been missing out ! <sssss> lets start with the atmosphere . <sssss> it felt cozy , decor was gorgeous , and everyone was so friendly . <sssss> now the food/drinks . <sssss> we were able to sample the salads , ziti , meatballs , and several different pizzas . <sssss> this was original italian food . <sssss> all of it was amazing . <sssss> the selection of wine was gigantic ! <sssss> our group was over 20 people and i did n't hear 1 complaint . <sssss> i will definitely be going back . 
4		spotted this familiar chain across the street from the cardinal 's stadium in the restaurant-filled outdoor westgate mall . <sssss> cost to worth it rating : 3 highlights : - beers : ~ 113 on draft , pints , yards , and half yards -lrb- 2 pints worth -rrb- available - lemonade : specialty vodka cocktail with a sprig of mint that was perfectly refreshing and not too sweet - sweet potato fries : thin and crispy with a drizzle of syrup - spicy chicken sandwich : blackened and on a flatbread roll which was thin yet dense and grilled - jerk wings : sauce was a wee bit spicy yet sweet - patio : tables and couches with misters - bathroom -lrb- from the hub -rrb- : 5 urinals and shelf to park your beer glass which he thought was awesome lowlights : - oc chain so not really getting the az experience . <sssss> nice afternoon spot for drinks and snacks . 
4		to be quite honest , i 've never heard of this place until i wandered by it one lazy saturday . <sssss> a friend and i went in expecting to see `` ribs '' as the primary dish to get . <sssss> man , were we wrong ! <sssss> they have amazing pork bbq sandwiches . <sssss> not the best , but pretty close -lrb- the top 3 in my book of phoenix bbq -rrb- . <sssss> the size of the sandwich is definitely filling . <sssss> my favorite part is when the sandwich has the coleslaw inside it . <sssss> i saw that they can also cater events , which is totally awesome ! <sssss> i would love to have the next work event catered by shane 's . <sssss> it looks like they give you tons of bbq pork to make sandwiches . 
4		the bakery is fantastic but so is their food . <sssss> i worked briefly for a real shithole in downtown but the one bright spot was it allowed me to lunch at azteca almost daily . <sssss> i fell in love with their carnitas burros , which are huge and about 3 bucks if i recall correctly . <sssss> one of the things i miss about being in california is how you can find those huge $ 3 burros just about everywhere , well azteca is your place for that sort of thing . <sssss> please go there and help support a great local restaurant and bakery . 
4		this restaurant has more selections to tempt your tastebuds than any southwestern or mexican joint in phoenix . <sssss> along with the traditional fajitas , rellenos , chimichangas , and hand rolled tamales , this unique venue offers up gumbos , gourmet chili , chilean sea bass , an oyster bar , and build your own margaritas . <sssss> not only is the menu exciting , but the moment you walk into the place you are enchanted . <sssss> high ceilings , graced with a colonnade of bronze , life size horses galloping across the ceiling , fountains , gothic lamps and oversized candles , a second story looking like a scene from three amigos ... you feel transported to another world . <sssss> on the weekends i highly recommend venturing there after 8pm to see the performing band of mariachis . <sssss> the group of girls are geared up with instruments , costumes , and beautiful singing voices , and they serenade all of the patrons . <sssss> recommendations : drinks : 1 . <sssss> their very popular coconut margarita , with the rim of the glass dipped in honey and smothered in roasted coconut flakes , or 2 . <sssss> my favorite , the sangria margarita . <sssss> not listed on the menu , but available . <sssss> appetizers : 1 . <sssss> tableside guacamole fresh avocado , spices , pico de gallo and fresh-squeezed lime . <sssss> prepared fresh at the table and served with tortilla chips 2 . <sssss> chile con queso my absolute favorite ! <sssss> an assorted blend of quesos and hatch green chile . <sssss> served fondue style with fresh hot tostadas . <sssss> entree : 1 . <sssss> the burrito magnifico it 's a burrito , not that exciting , but i love it ! <sssss> large flour tortilla filled with refritos , carne adovada , machaca and cheese , topped with hatch red and green chile . <sssss> served with refritos and arroz 2 . <sssss> red chipotle chicken pasta something different and delicious ! <sssss> fettuccini pasta with marinated chicken , confetti corn strips and our red chile chipotle alfredo sauce . <sssss> dessert : chocolate taco it does n't get any better here . <sssss> a garduño family favorite ! <sssss> chocolate coated crepe filled with a cream cheese and strawberry blend . <sssss> garnished with whipped cream , strawberries and toasted coconut shavings . 
4		this place is a sleeper . <sssss> it 's mixed in along with a cluster of other clubs and bars in old town scottsdale but has a very unique vibe . <sssss> lotsa tequila , which can be a very good or very bad thing , as we all know , but reasonable prices and a good inside/outside mix . <sssss> people seem to always congregate inside near the bar or outside at the tables , never so much in what looks to be the dining area . <sssss> the bathrooms are pretty gnarls barkley , but with that much booze and corona floating around that 's bound to happen . <sssss> food is so/so , but the staff is always friendly and quick to help out . 
4		the staff here is extremely polite and courteous . <sssss> i have n't been to a einstein bagels in years i completely forgot how delightful the food is here . <sssss> i ordered two bagels which only took about 3 minutes to make . <sssss> if your looking for some fast service i definitely would recommend this place . 
4		a great place in the hood . <sssss> the ambiance is great , good food , and fantastic staff . <sssss> i brought a few of my friends and colleagues here . <sssss> i said try the chicken sliders . <sssss> instantly they thought bar food , but they were surprised and found the food delicious . <sssss> i am glad to have a place like this in the coronado neighborhood . 
4		roka akor features top-quality sushi , outstanding service , and some interesting cocktail all wrapped in a tastefully appointed , airy dining room . <sssss> i 'm hesitant to give it 5 stars , since i generally feel a little ripped off by the portion size and the bill tipping over $ 100 for my wife and i even at happy hour , but i realize that 's what roka akor is . <sssss> it 's not somewhere you stop in for your monthly sushi unless you 're warren buffett or something -lrb- who , i assume , prefers beef -rrb- . <sssss> roka akor has to feature the best fish in arizona ... i just wish there was more of it . <sssss> oh , and the roasted duck with kimchee for $ 6 ... -lrb- kisses fingertips -rrb- ... a superb value . <sssss> get it . <sssss> the butterfish , too . <sssss> at least once . 
4		we came for the strawberry creme brulee waffle , but i was loving the eggs benedict so much more . <sssss> do n't get me wrong , the waffle fluffy interior & crispy exterior were delicious and fabulous , but what i expected in the execution was not even close . <sssss> i think the cream , which they were calling vanilla creme brulee did not take my taste buds to the awesomeness of creme brulees . <sssss> it was sweet cream . <sssss> i guess i was expecting burnt crystalized sugar ... that was it ! <sssss> so , why 4 stars ? <sssss> despite my expectations being shattered . <sssss> the food is good and top quality ! <sssss> they give you a huge cafe mug for coffee . <sssss> the house potatoes are everything you can ask for . <sssss> and , this an overall solid restaurant . <sssss> we will go back , for sure ... minus the strawberry creme brulee waffles , which should really be renamed the strawberry cream waffles . 
4		my first visit to javino 's , and it was a business lunch with a prospective client . <sssss> my first impressions were very favorable from the look and feel of the colors and design , the very attractive and polite hostess immediately welcomed us and offered to seat us . <sssss> our server , sheldon , was very attentive to us , giving us the `` space '' to talk over our business while making sure that we had everything we needed . <sssss> lunch was fantastic , for me , the javinos burger was perfect , and my guests enjoyed their wrap , and the shrimp salad . <sssss> all in all this was a very nice place with a warm environment and very good service ! 
4		have been going to crazy ottos for years . <sssss> we had all our family get together s there when we lived closer . <sssss> they were always very courteous even when we came in after the 12:00 mass with a group of people . <sssss> we were never turned away . <sssss> we pretty much stopped using this place as a family meeting place when we moved to a different part of the city . <sssss> after not being there for quite a while we stopped one day when we were in the area , an much to our surprise , the waiter said he missed our family visits and ask how everyone was doing . <sssss> we were treated like family . <sssss> i forgot to mention the food or the memories it made when a grandson ordered three pan cakes with eggs and hash browns , i still remember the look on his face or when our granddaughter ordered the hobo breakfast . <sssss> everyone at the table helped her eat it . <sssss> my personal favorite is the half chicken liver omelet . <sssss> do n't turn up your nose it 's great i also love the gravy -lrb- i think it 's made with ham or bacon drippings -rrb- mighty tasty . <sssss> it 's my wife 's 73 birthday on monday and she requested to go to crazy ottos for brunch . <sssss> we will show up with 15 to 20 people and they will accommodate us as they always have . <sssss> for my personal taste i prefer them to the place , they serve bisquits that taste like . <sssss> bisquit made with baking soda not yeast . 
4		friends who focus on hip rave about this place and i can see the appeal . <sssss> the taco fillings are on point and the fresh tortillas -lrb- i suspect stone ground -rrb- are exceptional . <sssss> the service is efficient if a bit breezy , and the price , especially on tue , was a value given the quality . <sssss> it 's a keeper even if it reminds you more of marin than ensenada 
4		joe 's has been a favorite of mine for many years . <sssss> the food is delicious - real comfort food here . <sssss> the ribs are a bit fatty , but most ribs are . <sssss> mac n cheese , cheesy potatoes , beans , brisket , everything is really tasty . 
4		the only reason we even tried this restaurant was all the positive yelp reviews . <sssss> actually , that 's not the only reason - also my parents were in town and my mom loves going to the casino and lone butte is the closest one to my house . <sssss> even though i had read the reviews , i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food . <sssss> the four of us had a very tasty meal that did not break the bank in a casual atmosphere and we got to play a little afterwards . <sssss> the calamari appetizer was absolutely delicious ! <sssss> it was not overcooked at all , just a light breading with some peppers mixed in to give it flavor and was served with a ample amount of tomato based dipping sauce . <sssss> i ordered the rack of lamb after reading jason l. 's review and was not disappointed . <sssss> perfectly cooked with a wonderfully sweet sauce . <sssss> it was way too much food for me so i only ate about half of it that night but the hubby enjoyed the leftovers the next day . <sssss> i ordered it with the mushrooms which i thought were a bit dry and not really very good but my mom liked them . <sssss> i did sample some of my husband 's mashed potatoes and i thought they were fantastic so i will definitely get that as my side dish if we go back . <sssss> he also enjoyed his steak and my parents liked their seafood dishes . <sssss> for dessert we all shared the tiramisu . <sssss> it was not a traditional tiramisu with the soggy cookies or cake layered in ; instead it was a rich mousse that was served with a lovely presentation in a martini glass with small -lrb- still crispy -rrb- ladyfingers sticking out . <sssss> i also had a cappuccino after dinner and was very impressed with the quality ... it was done in the traditional italian style with super strong espresso with no milk mixed in and a thick layer of foam on top . <sssss> fantastic ! <sssss> i was also impressed with the wine list . <sssss> they had a great variety but a lot of bottles were very reasonably priced . <sssss> if i am going to go out for steak , i usually prefer a bit more of a high-class place just because i like to get dressed up when we do a date night . <sssss> however , even though most of the patrons in the restaurant were the traditional casino-goers -lrb- old men in hawaiian shirts accompanied by grannies in polyester that smell heavily of tobacco smoke and bengay -rrb- and the decor was a little worn with the typical tacky casino carpeting and gaudy art on the walls i still thought it was n't too bad of a place as far as the ambiance . <sssss> we enjoyed the piano player and singer - she was amazing - but i do wish that they did n't have a speaker since it makes the music a bit too loud for comfortable conversation . <sssss> but maybe they do that to cover up the ding-ding-ding from the slot machines that are just steps outside the door ... 
4		the pho ga -lrb- chicken soup -rrb- is really good . <sssss> its flavorful and good ingridients ... now i also tried the vietnamese sub , the bread was good and crunchy but the bbq meat was `` meh '' , nothing too crazy about it . <sssss> the spring rolls with shrimp with peanut dip sauce tasted bland as well , almost like it was imitation shrimp , very chewy so it whatevers and then the crunch roll with fish sauce was actually good too . <sssss> i had a banana smoothie to wash it down but was dissapointed , nothing too crazy , i wished they mixed it in with milk instead of water because it just tasted watered down . <sssss> all in all i always come back have the chicken pho 
4		overrated ? <sssss> yes . <sssss> but is it still good ? <sssss> yes . <sssss> when i moved to phoenix 3 1/2 years ago , pizzeria bianco was one of the first restaurants i was told i had to try . <sssss> but i also heard about the ridiculous wait times , so that always prevented me from going . <sssss> my dad was in town , and after seeing pb on food network , he wanted to try it , so that 's where we went . <sssss> first , i had no idea where pb was located , and i had a difficult time trying to find it . <sssss> unbeknownst to me , i drive by it literally every day , but the closed gate on adams off of 7h street threw me for a loop . <sssss> but alas , i finally found it ! <sssss> there is free valet parking right next to the restaurant , right before that closed gate . <sssss> it was a thursday evening around 5:45 , and i was mentally prepared for a 2 hour wait ; so i was pleasantly surprised when i found out the wait was only about 20 minutes ! <sssss> nice ! <sssss> that made me very happy ! <sssss> we started off with the caprese salad . <sssss> the mozzarella and tomatoes were really fresh , and the salad was refreshing overall . <sssss> we then ordered 2 pizzas , but we were able to try 4 different pizzas because we took advantage of the half and half ordering . <sssss> let 's see , we had the rosa , wise guy , margherita and biancoverde . <sssss> the wise guy has big slices of grilled onions and pieces of fennel sausage . <sssss> it was really good ! <sssss> the margherita was probably my fave -- the ingredients were really fresh , and the sauce tasted like it was freshly made . <sssss> the rosa was my least favorite . <sssss> although it tasted good , the combination of red onions and pistachios was a little too pungent for me to enjoy more than one slice . <sssss> newsflash : the chocolate icee -lrb- which has a much fancier name that i ca n't remember -rrb- is a must ! <sssss> oh my ... i 'm not even a chocolate eater , but this icee was absolutely delish ! <sssss> it was so refreshing , and the perfect after pizza treat ! <sssss> my only gripe is that we felt like we were being rushed at the end , and not by our server , who was male . <sssss> the moment we emptied a glass or cleared a plate , some chick would immediately come by to take it off the table . <sssss> i understand that they 're trying to move tables , but when we spend $ 16 each for medium size pizzas , we 'll take our time getting up from the table . <sssss> nice try , though . <sssss> all in all , the pizza was good , i ca n't take anything away from that . <sssss> but for me , it did n't live up to the hype of being `` the best pizza in the country . '' <sssss> i 've had similar quality pizza right here in phoenix -lrb- i.e. , try the prosciutto and artichoke pizza at amano bistro in south mountain -rrb- . 
4		very clean , staff is friendly . <sssss> i only bought a salad for lunch -lrb- southwest quinoa salad -rrb- , but i liked it so much that i took a picture of the ingredients so i can try to replicate it at home . <sssss> i just signed up for their rewards card , too . <sssss> it 's not the biggest grocery store in the world , but it has the basics . 
4		hillside spot is a pleasant little neighborhood cafe in ahwatukee . <sssss> we have made a couple stops here at various times of the day and have been able to sample the fare and the atmosphere during both a sunday morning breakfast rush , and a week night dinner rush . <sssss> the breakfast burrito with chorizo was very good , as was the carne asada torta i had at our dinnertime visit . <sssss> i look forward to return visits to explore more of their menu . <sssss> as an added bonus ... there is a nice little variety of fine craft beers in the cooler up front . <sssss> be sure to take a look at what 's available before you are seated . <sssss> oh , and the seating ... there is both indoor and patio seating . <sssss> the patio is large and centered around a good sized fireplace ... a great location to enjoy a nice craft brew in the evening , next to the fire ... only in the months of december and january though when weather temperatures permit . <sssss> i 'd definitely recommend this place if you are in the area . 
4		best bagels in the valley , best in phoenix , best in az , best in the west , best outside ny and nj ! <sssss> in other words , i loved it ! <sssss> came in yesterday just passing by -lrb- i was the brunette east coast girl -rrb- . <sssss> loved the doughy-ness , nice plump bagels . <sssss> there seem to be a few different kinds of `` real '' ny bagels and these are one of them . <sssss> if you do n't see me in here every day , it 's only because i will get addicted ! <sssss> coffee was not perfect . <sssss> maybe i did n't get a fresh batch . 
4		i went back after a long break no real reason just have n't been back . <sssss> i had the usual lunch combo pizza and salad for $ 9 . <sssss> i also got my favorite italian soda very chanilla . <sssss> as usual the food was very good and the service was good . <sssss> there was one thing i noticed that the usual bread with oil portion was smaller than normal . 
4		mastro 's has always proven itself to be a classy steakhouse . <sssss> phil the manager makes you feel like family . <sssss> and if you do n't have radolfo assisting with your table , you are missing out ! <sssss> last night we skipped dinner and came in for just wine and dessert . <sssss> as we made the reservation , this was mentioned . <sssss> we had a warm welcome and a great glass of wine from our favorite bartender oscar as we waited for our table to open up . <sssss> after we were seated , our waiter - brent handed over the dinner menu 's . <sssss> we informed him we were only here for wine and dessert . <sssss> brent proceeded to rip the menus out of our hands , grab the bread basket and shove it to the assistant and threw a huge fit to the manager . <sssss> i have never been more embarrassed or treated this poorly in my life ! <sssss> besides being belittled for taking a table near the bar just for `` wine and dessert '' by brent , the warm butter cake made up for his poor service . <sssss> if you have n't had this already , you must , i say must try this dessert . <sssss> its heaven . <sssss> needless to say , i love mastro 's and will be coming back but never , i repeat , never sitting at brent 's table again -lrb- unless we are just there for wine and dessert ! <sssss> ha ha -rrb- . 
4		so curious me , i had to see what all the yelpabaloo was about -lrb- yeah , that 's a new yelp-ism - be sure to jot it down for your next review -rrb- , and i must admit , this place lived up to the hype for me . <sssss> it 's a little outside my normal dining zone , but since i was downtown with my lil bro seeing a movie at arizona center , we decided to stop by on our way home . <sssss> the vegetarian pizza was delicious . <sssss> loaded with fresh veggies , including artichoke hearts , on top of an incredible thin & crispy crust , i just wish i 'd ordered a larger size so i 'd have more leftovers . <sssss> do n't get me wrong , the portions are generous , i just wanted more . <sssss> there 's definitely more on the menu than pizza , including pasta and calzones , which , after watching a few being served around me and listening to the oohs and ahhs while they were consumed , i will definitely be ordering next time . <sssss> the place is small - very small , less than a dozen tables - so i imagine it probably fills up quickly in the evenings . <sssss> so small in fact that several conversations were restaurant wide - creating quite the communal dining experience - one of which involved yelp . <sssss> the owner 's a big fan , as several patrons including myself mentioned it as their reason for checking them out . <sssss> my lil bro 's review : `` awesome . '' <sssss> the only thing that would have made it better , he said , were video games . <sssss> who can argue with that ? 
4		oh yeah !!! <sssss> oregano 's is great . <sssss> the pizza is the best and thin crust is always a good choice . <sssss> their pastas are good too . <sssss> if you are there on a weekend night , be prepared to wait . <sssss> it fills up quick . 
4		the lost olives is my favorite car wash . <sssss> it just happens to be a block from where i live , but as a former danny 's regular what i can say about this place is very important : consistency - they always get the job done right , with minimal whining if and when i point out a few missed spots on the bumper , wheels , whatever . <sssss> my only complaint is the punch cards , i cant keep track of them , wish they would just keep track of my license plate . <sssss> also important if you have an expensive car - there are no brushes or automated things touching your paint . <sssss> just hands . <sssss> lots of hands . <sssss> bottom line : many hands beat auto-wash any day 
4		try it you will like it ! <sssss> large selection of dishes to choose from along with the handmade noodle dishes . <sssss> you can choose the style of noodle you want . <sssss> portions large enough you can take some home . <sssss> yummy and inexpensive . <sssss> fast and friendly service . <sssss> they give you water without having to ask . <sssss> mmmm ... boiled peanuts ... we ordered beef fried noodle in xo sauce with thick noodle , seafood fried noodle with hand pulled noodle , ox tail noodle soup with shaved noodle - all very good . <sssss> my only complaint is could have used more meat to noodle ratio . <sssss> the egg rolls were delicious as well . <sssss> you get a little cup of radish carrot salad and boiled peanuts with your meal . 
4		i think my mother makes the best fry bread but this place works in a pinch . <sssss> we 've been going to both locations for awhile and can be counted on for it 's consistency . <sssss> try the tortillas and green chile hominy stew . <sssss> i find it surprising when people complain about greasy fry bread because i think the name itself implies what you can expect . <sssss> i give it a four for food and food quality alone but i 'm not looking for a tremendous dining experience when i get there . 
4		i had sunday brunch here a couple of weeks ago and was anticipating a great meal . <sssss> the first thing that struck me was that our group of 5 were the only people in the restaurant at noon on a sunday . <sssss> we were the only ones there when we arrived and the only ones there when we left . <sssss> surprising . <sssss> the person serving us seemed to be pulling double duty . <sssss> while i ca n't be sure of this , his frequent and lengthy absences had me suspicious that he was , in fact , cooking our meals . <sssss> that being said , the food was excellent . <sssss> eggs benedict is the bellwether of all brunch meals for me , so that 's what i ordered . <sssss> the latte that i ordered was exceptional . <sssss> at $ 5 a pop , i easily could have run up a $ 30 + bar tab on these alone . <sssss> to keep costs under control , i made the switch to regular coffee , which was also excellent . <sssss> all in all , a great meal . <sssss> my only disappointments were the lack of crowds and spotty service . <sssss> hopefully , some of you will read this and put coup des tartes on your sunday brunch rotation ! 
4		i love the concept of this place , food drink and free games . <sssss> there 's value there because you can spend a lot playing games at places like dave n busters . <sssss> let 's get to the food , i had the trout . <sssss> it was topped with green beans almonds and onions , what a nice combination of flavors . <sssss> the fish was cooked just right , it was moist and i enjoyed every bite . <sssss> another memorable thing from my dinner here is they have these mystery brown paper bag beers for $ 1.50 . <sssss> you never know what beer you will get -lrb- icehouse was one of them -rrb- but this is a great deal ! <sssss> and it 's kinda cool drinking a beer out of a paper bag in a restaurant . 
4		i love this place ! <sssss> the clerks are helpful and knowledgeable . <sssss> randy has been a steady anchor for many years . <sssss> i stopped hanging out in the lounge because the t.v. seems to be stuck on fox . <sssss> this of course attracts a lot of angry , conservative nut jobs . <sssss> also , if you do n't look like wally clever , you 'll probably be surveilled when you enter the humidor . 
4		cute space , great coffee , great service ... friendly and smiling baristas ... prices right on the money ... but ... i do n't understand why the place is so empty on a mid friday morning ... when lux is always busy ... very relaxing lounge with mixed furniture and sofas ... did n't see much in terms of pastries though ... maybe i did n't look hard enough ... cafe latte was lovely and artfully presented in a ceramic cup and a heart shaped poured finish ... wishing you much success ... considering you are right next to matt 's ... have a great summer ! 
4		went there for lunch today and had the absolute best oysters i have ever had . <sssss> half dozen from the east coast delish ! <sssss> i also had the tuna tartine which was great also i had to push aside the olive side but i am just not an olive fan . <sssss> my boyfriend got a chicken dish , poulet something and gobbled it up ! <sssss> we both ended up fighting over the grilled corn with creme it was so so good ! <sssss> the service also made it very worth while , i asked for sangria which they did n't have however he offered to make me one and it was delish ! <sssss> no complaints will definatly come back ! 
4		9/11 finally made it out here ! <sssss> while they were offering up their `` dog days of summer '' -lrb- everyday in september offered two different gourmet hot dog selections , most of which sounded divine even though i rarely consume them nowadays -rrb- and fresh lemonade , i decided to try their bacon blue cheese burger with sweet potato fries . <sssss> while i waited for my order , i decided to check out the restroom facility to wash my hands and found , to my slight discomfort , an animation film classic `` stingray '' playing on a 13 '' television console inside -lrb- along with showcases of barbie and ken on the walls -rrb- . <sssss> while novel to see , as i said , this blast-from-the-past just made me want to leave the facility as fast as i could . <sssss> something about those faces creeps me out ! <sssss> this burger was superb ! <sssss> i can not find fault in any of the components , from the grilled bun and perfectly-grilled patty , to the tasty homemade bbq -lrb- a popular offering from jfg 's sister company , joe 's real bbq -rrb- smothered on huge and crispy bacon and onion rings , to the heavenly chunky blue cheese dressing ! <sssss> -lrb- oh , that blue cheese dressing ... just give me a cup of this dressing and a straw to slurp it all up and i 'm a happy camper ! -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> the sweet potato fries were amazing !! <sssss> yes , i 'd gladly drive 70 miles rt to order this platter of food again and again . <sssss> but , let 's not forget to make room for dessert ! <sssss> hot fudge sundae lovers must try the mud sundae , a twist on the classic hot fudge sundae with malt added . <sssss> mmmm ... it was a little busy when i arrived at 11a , and thankful i was to arrive then for the lunch time crowd was ridiculous ! <sssss> patio-seating -lrb- shaded by trees -rrb- was crowded , and indoors soon mirrored the patio , with a line threatening to extend beyond the doors -lrb- and it was so hot that day , too ! -rrb- 
4		so much better than pizzaria bianco ! <sssss> the food is excellent , as is the service and price . <sssss> my hubby and i always go when we have friends or family in from out of town . <sssss> do n't leave without trying the bruschetta . <sssss> the pizza is flavorful and interesting . <sssss> once we were there and there was an awful guitarist which was really unpleasant . <sssss> other than that , excellent ! 
4		the chocolate , peanut butter , banana protein shake is delici ! <sssss> great for a post workout treat or if you have had your wisdom 's pulled . <sssss> if and when i feel under the weather i usually go in and get a vitamin c smoothie with an immune booster . <sssss> they also sell supplements and lotions . <sssss> jd is great ! 
4		i came here after consulting yelp about where to eat for lunch , i decided on this indian restaurant . <sssss> sorta hidden in a plaza among a buncha of business building , it has a clean and decorative interior . <sssss> i went for their lunch buffet which is $ 10/person . <sssss> the buffet consisted of 3-4 meat curries an 3-4 vegetarian curries with about 5-6 side dishes -lrb- samosas , veggies , etc -rrb- . <sssss> there 's enough rice and naan to go around ! <sssss> the service was okay , as long as you are n't afraid to flag someone down and at 12noon the place was about half full , so not too crowded . <sssss> the actual dishes were yum ! <sssss> pretty tasty , yummy , but a bit heavy . <sssss> usually i can fit 2 rounds of foods in my bell-ay , but this time i could n't even get myself to finish my second plate . <sssss> and as usual , i shed a tear because there was leftover indian food on my plate that i could n't fit in my stomach . <sssss> * cry * !! 
4		still a solid 4 stars in my book . <sssss> ordered hot and sour soup last night and it was just ok . <sssss> it was very brothy , and not as dark as most hot and sour soups . <sssss> i suppose when thinking of my health , this is a great thing , but it just lacked in consistancy and the flavor was a bit odd . <sssss> it had a great little kick to it , which you do n't often find in hot and sour soups -- so good job in that regard . 
4		really nice selection of stores and places to eat ! <sssss> the play factory is located here which is a really fun spot for kids and they also have a splash pad . <sssss> it can get a bit hot walking outside in the summer , but that 's a minor complaint and just something that comes with living in az. . 
4		the minute my coffee was halfway , it was filled up ... the service here was great . <sssss> i had a business breakfast and i 'll certainly be back to do it again . 
4		been to this location for our kids ' haircuts many times . <sssss> they do a good job ... and make the kids feel at ease . <sssss> clean place - as much as any place with loads of hair can be . <sssss> they offer online check-in too which saves alot of time when you walk in with 3 heads for haircuts . 
4		right before i heard about the new beach club that will be taking over where myst and suede now are , i had finally checked out spanish fly , a bar and restaurant housed in one of my former old faves , drift , that already brought a beachy feel to old town scottsdale . <sssss> i went there not expecting much in terms of food , since i had seen scantily clad crowds taking over the premises on weekend days that made it seem more like a spot to be seen than get decent grub . <sssss> but spanish fly has a pretty kick-arse happy hour menu , and their bean and cheese burritos rival my current faves , those of america 's taco shop . <sssss> and no , if you go there on a weekday night dressed in your business clothes right after work , you do n't have to worry about not fitting in with a bikini-clad crowd -- bathing suits are only acceptable there on weekends during the day . <sssss> the bar looks like it should be connected to a hotel , with pebble floors and lots of lounge-y furniture surrounding the pool . <sssss> our bartender was friendly and laid-back , and the crowd was more diverse than the typical plastic you might expect from old town -- while most of the patrons were young , some seemed like they had just left work . <sssss> spanish fly 's extensive happy hour is monday-friday from noon-8 p.m. , making it a great place to day drink . <sssss> the happy hour menu features half-off appetizers , party bowls and bottles , as well as two-for-one drinks . <sssss> their margaritas -lrb- $ 8 - $ 10 -rrb- were super-strong , so i thought it was definitely a great deal . <sssss> we tried the bean and cheese dip -lrb- $ 6 -- at happy hour , only $ 3 -rrb- with chips , and it was a decently portioned serving of nachos that was heavier on the cheese than the beans . <sssss> i also had a muy delicioso bean and cheese burrito -lrb- i ordered off the menu since the menu only features chicken fajita and carne asada burritos -rrb- , and the burrito was huge and very filling and had the perfect balance of beans and cheese . <sssss> i loved it ! <sssss> while i enjoyed drift for its tropical-inspired cocktails and decor , spanish fly did n't disappoint at all when it came to ambiance and food . <sssss> i 'd go back for lunch or happy hour or on a weekend when i want to be surrounded by beauties in a hotel-like pool without the room charge . 
4		normally i 'm not a big chain restaurant frequenter but i like that the keg steakhouse sends me an email where i can get $ 25 off a birthday dinner . <sssss> thus , the husband and i went recently for my birthday and it was delicious . <sssss> i ordered the filet oscar , which is a tenderloin wrapped in bacon and topped with shrimp , scallops and asparagus with béarnaise sauce . <sssss> delicious ! <sssss> the steak was medium-rare , which made a tender meal . <sssss> i normally really like béarnaise sauce but this sauce was overpowering - wish i ordered it on the side . <sssss> the shrimp and scallops were fantastic though . <sssss> the husband ordered one of their specials , i ca n't remember which , but it was steak and it was cooked just right . <sssss> both of us got the twice baked potato which is really fluffy with bacon bits . <sssss> for desert we ordered the billy miner pie . <sssss> husband loved the pie . <sssss> our waitress was super perky and friendly . <sssss> she was able to offer different items on the menu and segway into holiday meals without seeming harsh or pushy . <sssss> great service ! <sssss> overall , it 's a good time that we enjoy once or twice a year . 
4		i am going to start off by saying i am an egg roll snob and they got 4 stars alone on that yum ! <sssss> the location is a little scary i 'm not gon na lie but once you get in it is very cute . <sssss> the service was great i was a little nervous when we walked in and no one else was there i had the sweet and sour chicken and my boyfriend had the duck , my chicken was very tasty as far as the duck the skin was good and crispy but to greasy for the actual meat and would not really recommend that but the egg rolls and sweet and sour sauce were out of this world i ca n't wait to go back again ... 
4		my friend has been here before and recommend we go for drinks & apps . <sssss> we went on a wednesday so happy hour prices are all day which is awesome ! <sssss> the drink & food menu offer many choices and variety , which i really liked ! <sssss> i ordered a mai tai which was really good ! <sssss> not too sweet and you could taste the liquor for only $ 5 the sweet potato fries with secret sauce were excellent and shrimp rolls were pretty yummy too . <sssss> we just had apps but i will def be back for lunch or dinner :-rrb- : -rrb- 
4		i 've been a fan of hazelwoods for years ! <sssss> i love the greek salad . <sssss> but they never seem to put enough red onions on the salad . <sssss> i always have to ask for extra red onions . <sssss> -lrb- that 's just my opinion -rrb- the ruben sandwich is very yummy ! <sssss> if you like sauerkraut , they put extra on this sandwich . <sssss> now , i 've never had one of their burgers until last night . <sssss> i seriously think i hurt myself ! <sssss> we started off the night with a $ 5 kiltlifter mug and then ordered dinner . <sssss> the 1st place burger and french fries was a big helping ! <sssss> i was able to eat 90 % of my plate ! <sssss> since i live 100 yards from hazelwoods we always walk . <sssss> the walk home was hurtful ! <sssss> i do n't think i 'll have the burger again . <sssss> it was delicious do n't me wrong , it was just too much for me . <sssss> on another note , hazelwoods has some of the best garlic chicken wings around ! <sssss> i defiantly recommend hazelwoods to any and everyone ! 
4		it 's always a happy surprise when coming here , either in the way of a seasonal beer or a employee who hates their job . <sssss> either way the food is always what i expect and tastes the way i remember . <sssss> if i want a sure bet i come here . <sssss> love the soups and pizza lunch specials and the to go service to your car . 
4		love this mall ! <sssss> i try to stop here when in the scottsdale area as it has a great mix of high end designer stores like neiman marcus , barney 's , lv , prada , nordstrom , as well as the cheap thrills like forever 21 and h&m . <sssss> there are lots of food options including a few restaurants if you are n't into food court fare . <sssss> no better way to get out of the arizona heat than a hefty dose of retail therapy here ! 
4		the food was tasty and fresh . <sssss> chips were wam and crispy and salsa was good . <sssss> while it was not the greatest mexican north of the border , it was way above average . <sssss> what knocked it out of the park was the service . <sssss> explained to the waiter we were in a hurry for a family reason and we got food right away with check right after it . <sssss> assured us we did not have to rush but had everything ready so we could . <sssss> we will bring the kids and return good food and great staff . 
4		fez , fez , fez is like an icon for gay community in phx . <sssss> they r luxurious , they r fancy and good taste . <sssss> the food is awesome , the drinks incredible and fruity hahaha , the service is so friendly -lrb- ask for monika she 's the best -rrb- is a mix of crow , from gay , to straight to families all kind of people . <sssss> seriously u will leave loving this place ... !!!! 
4		love the chicken and the baked mac is the best i have ever had . <sssss> the owner is a great guy who truly makes you feel like he has welcomed you right into his home . <sssss> this place has become a regular spot for my family . <sssss> a hidden gem ! 
4		what am i doing in a chain restaurant ? <sssss> drinking of course . <sssss> a friend of mine recommended that we meet here to start our night off . <sssss> i had no idea what to expect or what this place was . <sssss> i walked in and bellied up to the bar and was pleasantly surprised at the selection of beer that was offered . <sssss> they had micro brews as well as beers from around the globe . <sssss> this is from a chain restaurant and not from a specialty bar . <sssss> you might be wondering what about the food ? <sssss> sorry the only food we had was the jalapeno firehouse wings or should i say drummettes . <sssss> we asked for the wing portion and was told that was all they had . <sssss> oh well , they tasted good anyway and we ate three plates of them . <sssss> i will try to go back to sample more of their food if i can get past the bar . 
4		this is a ma and pa store and that 's one reason why i like it . <sssss> stop in and see george if you can . <sssss> i 've been here once and actually got served by george . <sssss> yes , they really are greek . <sssss> the place is a little , yellow joint with a tiny outdoor table with one rainbow colored umbrella over it . <sssss> the inside is better . <sssss> they have a tiny table and some stools for a `` bar '' . <sssss> however , there are cool posters of greece on the wall that make up for the modesty of the place . <sssss> the gyros are good , not sure about the american food . <sssss> they have cold beers . <sssss> prices are reasonable . <sssss> it 's always dead when i drive by it . <sssss> hope it survives the depression . <sssss> tried to go back one time at 10am when the door said it was open but the door was locked and nobody was inside . <sssss> if i had more cash on hand , i would try another trip . 
4		who ever heard of putting mushrooms in mac and cheese ?! <sssss> they did , and it works - my mushroom hating husband finished his entire side of it ! <sssss> this was a first-time for me with eating chicken and waffles together , and it was wonderful ! <sssss> their waffles are really good with a hint of vanilla and the chicken is fried perfectly . <sssss> they also make the best sweet tea i 've had in arizona - as close to north carolina 's as i 've had in the southwest ! <sssss> get the `` betty boop '' you ca n't go wrong ! <sssss> : -rrb- 
4		you know you are in the `` south '' when you are drinking ice tea from a jar ! <sssss> well , technically i was , south phoenix to be exact . <sssss> in fact , the tea was unsweetened ! <sssss> yes , i know , a southern faux pas ! <sssss> might of been the healthiest thing one could order here . <sssss> so after waiting a few long minutes , my main feast arrived . <sssss> where do i start ? <sssss> ah , good old chicken leg , nice , small and manageable . <sssss> done ! <sssss> time for my double layer waffles topped with creamy , melty butter . <sssss> `` that 's money ! '' <sssss> borrowing a gleeful phrase guy fieri always says in his food network show , d , d , and d. :-rrb- so my two other pieces were the breast and thigh . <sssss> i knew what i was getting into so i carefully avoided the glistening , crunchy evil they call : the skin . <sssss> but i did have a little and it was packed with all the great tasting herbs and spices that make up this southern style cuisine . <sssss> that is what makes it distinct from your mainstream chains . <sssss> now , the battle between the chicken and waffle , i give the waffle a slight edge . <sssss> its not the thick kind you might expect , but its still pretty good . <sssss> well , all in all , i 'm glad somebody in the deep south came up with this comforting duo that even my inner soul can taste . 
4		i came here because i saw pictures of sushi on the yelp app that made my mouth water . <sssss> unfortunately , i did n't get any of those pieces but what i had was okay . <sssss> the quail eggs were delicious . <sssss> the bartender here is phenomenal ! <sssss> cute little asian packed with personality . <sssss> she made me promise to come every thursday for ladies night . <sssss> if you 're a female in the area on a thursday , go there ! <sssss> she will take care of you ! 
4		nice restaurant and food is good . <sssss> the service is slow so do n't be in a rush . <sssss> but worth it if you have the time . 
4		it is what it is , do n't judge me . <sssss> i just moved to central phoenix and one of the first things i looked for was the nearest del taco -lrb- which i admit is pretty pathetic considering all of the great food options near my house -rrb- . <sssss> i used to live in tempe and there was a location at university and rural that i used to frequent on late nights for the longest time . <sssss> sadly , it 's been closed and replaced by some random chicken place . <sssss> went here twice the past weekend . <sssss> love those veggie burritos with the red sauce ! <sssss> i also tried some nachos-wouldn ' t really recommend it . <sssss> super fast & cheap , great for a quick lunch or dinner-which is exactly the point . 
4		we drove 45 minutes from the west valley to buy `` dill pickle popcorn '' from bubba corn . <sssss> i fell in love with that stuff at the yelp science center event . <sssss> it was 4th of july weekend and so stinking hot outside . <sssss> i 'm not sure if the market is usually as tiny , or if vendors were out of town ... or hiding indoors somewhere . <sssss> we bought yellow tomatoes and sweet corn that were amazing ! <sssss> i 'd eat the tomatoes like apples , but with a dash of salt . <sssss> -lrb- yum ! <sssss> now i 'm craving them . -rrb- <sssss> i ca n't wait to go again once it cools down , so it will be more enjoyable . 
4		first let me start by saying that i love a good burger , so i see this place on-line and decide to check it out , as i enter the restaurant i am greeted with a big hello and welcome which was a very good feeling , i proceeded to order from the simple menu and ordered the standard burger with cheese and caramelized onion 's and a order of fries , i was pleasantly impressed with the quality and freshness of the meat and the bun , the fries were hand cut and very good also , i would give this place a high 4 and maybe a low 5 , only reason for the 4 is there is n't much seating and if you get your order to go it 's not wrapped to tight , package is left open . <sssss> love the burger ... jc 
4		i love this complex ! <sssss> the staff is excellent ; they are friendly and responsive to my issues but not overly fake , invasive , or trying to create that false sense of community that never exists in a complex of hundreds of different people . <sssss> the grounds are very maintained and they respond very quickly and appropriately to maintenance calls . <sssss> the only reason i gave them 4 in stead of 5 stars is because of a minor problem that exists . <sssss> the walls between units are thin . <sssss> even with quiet neighbors i can hear loud conversations , movement , music , pipes running water . <sssss> i do n't mind the noise so much , the neighbors are fairly quiet around my unit , but if i had louder neighbors it might make for a terrible experience . 
4		live music , plenty of beer on tap , and a very happening place . <sssss> this place was packed with people however with a group of 6 we still found tables and chairs . <sssss> i enjoyed some beers on tap , but wanted to try some food so we ordered the copper blues burger . <sssss> very good burger , fresh tasting and the bacon and cheddar hit the spot . <sssss> the fries are good , which i normally do not eat at all . <sssss> nothing like enjoying a nite out with friends . <sssss> live music , great food , and plenty of drinks and beers on tap to enjoy . <sssss> we all had a great time out . <sssss> service was great and everyone seemed pretty friendly there . <sssss> great atmosphere here . 
4		super cool place for laid back types ... you can tell this place has it 's regulars . <sssss> i loved that it had a diverse crowd and a welcoming environment . <sssss> the staff was definitely on it 's toes for lunch time and they did n't miss a beat ! <sssss> i heard this was the place to go for breakfast , but since i came here for lunch i ordered the chicken fried chicken sandwich and it hit the spot . <sssss> i love that this place is tucked away yet seems to not have any trouble getting business . <sssss> it 's pretty close to work so i 'm sure i 've got a new place to hit up for grabbing a bite to eat . 
4		dr mccoy is outstanding , he and dr brent rich -lrb- dr rich is now in ut -rrb- have helped our family numerous times with various injuries , aches and pains over the past 11 years . <sssss> some of the staff may not be our top choice , but dr mccoy is definitely worth dealing with any other aggravation . 
4		my wife and i had a living social coupon and so we decided to try the place , but when we went by , the sign on the door said they were on vacation . <sssss> bad sign -- we 're not from the area and we could n't get back until after the coupon expired . <sssss> management offered to extend it for us , however . <sssss> which was great because we were then able to try this really good mexican food . <sssss> we both had the los dos flautas special , which consisted of two very large and filling flautas filled with shredded beef or chicken . <sssss> the beef was absolutely delicious -- just mouth watering , juicy and not too spicy . <sssss> this restaurant is famous for it 's hot , spicy foods so we were happy to find an entré that did not have too much zip . <sssss> the flautas had a great guac and some very fresh sour cream , along with rather average rice but really excellent beans . <sssss> i only wish this restaurant would have a low-powered gringo version of their salsa . <sssss> neither one of us could dip their excellent chips into the offered sauce . <sssss> too hot by far ! 
4		had the pleasure of enjoying house of tricks last night , for the second time in the past twelve months . <sssss> with a party of six , i was excited to get to see a range of dishes and try out most of the menu via my dining companions choices . <sssss> the restaurant , found in tempe near asu , is not hard to find and houses both indoor and outdoor seating . <sssss> the outdoor seating is where we ended up last night and between the fire pit in the middle of the grounds and the abundance of trees/greenery , the setting works quite well . <sssss> our party was seated immediately and without problem , the night was off to a solid start . <sssss> our waitress , jamie , was both friendly and courteous . <sssss> jamie had a great understanding of the menu , the specials and especially the wine . <sssss> her recommendations for multiple members of the party worked out perfectly . <sssss> each person in our party ordered an appetizer and off we went . <sssss> i had the pork belly , on jamie 's suggestion . <sssss> other choices within our party included the salmon cake , sweetbreads two ways , and the scallops . <sssss> i thought the pork belly was great . <sssss> it had a pea puree as a base sauce and some baby carrots that just killed . <sssss> the scallops were tasty and cooked perfectly . <sssss> the sweetbreads two ways were a bit of a letdown . <sssss> as a lover of sweetbreads , i have had the pleasure of tasting some of the best variations of there preparation . <sssss> these were just not that great . <sssss> they were n't cooked properly and the seasoning was lacking . <sssss> this would be the only lacking dish of the evening . <sssss> for the entree , i had the pork osso bucco . <sssss> this was a real treat , cooked evenly , tender and tasty . <sssss> other entree selections around the table included the ahi tuna , the salmon , and the duck . <sssss> the tuna was the standard seared variety on a bed of mashed potatoes . <sssss> both diners who chose this selection were quite satisfied . <sssss> my companion had the duck and while she certainly enjoyed the dish , she found the duck slightly fatty . <sssss> all around , the entrees were solid and plates were cleaned . <sssss> with little room left for dessert , we ordered three selections for the table to share . <sssss> all were good and once again our plates were cleaned off . <sssss> the dessert best was agreed upon to be the homemade smore the restaurant produces . <sssss> all in all , this is a solid restaurant with a good atmosphere and good service . <sssss> i would eat here again and recommend you to do the same . 
4		here with a review of a dinner for two on 11/16/13 . <sssss> cordial greeting and seated within a few minutes of our reservation time . <sssss> andrew , brett and raul are a great team . <sssss> very responsive but not `` doting '' . <sssss> -lrb- i think andrew was not totally forthcoming about his relationship with raymond patriarca . <sssss> hmmmm :--rrb- . -rrb- <sssss> ok . <sssss> on to food and drink . <sssss> cocktails were good and served promptly . <sssss> bacon wrapped scallops were tasty . <sssss> my date had the filet mignon , i had the peppercorn version of same . <sssss> both were excellent ... cooked to perfection . <sssss> -lrb- and served on a `` be careful - the plate is hot '' dish . -rrb- <sssss> surprised more restaurants do n't do that . <sssss> it allows one to proceed casually through dinner knowing the entree wo n't get cold . -rrb- <sssss> throughout the meal andrew and team were always close by but not `` all over us '' . <sssss> the brownie dessert was , as we say in boston , wicked awesome ! <sssss> why only four stars ? <sssss> ordered a glass of chappellet mountain cuvee . <sssss> the glass - very important - was good but the wine was way too warm . <sssss> need to work on this . <sssss> should n't be hard to do . <sssss> in summary , a very enjoyable evening . <sssss> pricey ? <sssss> sure . <sssss> but you get what you pay for . <sssss> i left with a feeling of satisfaction and good value . 
4		small-as-a-shoebox tapas place about 1 year new , lola is a nice distinctive treat in central phoenix . <sssss> look for the golden sign and 1960s mercedes parked out front . <sssss> you 're greeted immediately by a friendly hostess , several communal tables , and really rad 70s iberian light fixtures . <sssss> i dined here a while back and munched on a spanish tortilla -lrb- a frittata-like dish -rrb- , serrano ham , gazpacho and a glass of malbec . <sssss> it 's been a while so i ca n't review too confidently , but highly encourage a visit ! <sssss> edit - 6/07 a big group of us came the other day and we ordered everything . <sssss> holy crap , was this shiz good . <sssss> my 3 star experience became a 4 star one . <sssss> the filet was rockin , and so was the grilled asparagus , but even better was this spanish cheese spread over crusty bread and the garlic and chile marinated grilled shrimp . 
4		scramble is our go to neighborhood breakfast place . <sssss> the food is fresh and tasty with real ingredients and almost always delivers as sometimes the rosemary potatoes are a hit or miss or the cinnamon roll may not be full cooked through depending on how backed up the kitchen is which brings me to my next point . <sssss> arrive early -lrb- ! -rrb- <sssss> or be prepared to wait a while just like any other breakfast place . <sssss> i usually get the dollar buttermilk pancakes -lrb- serving of 3 -rrb- with a side of rosemary potatoes but have tried the veggie omelet , biscuits and gravy , cinnamon roll & french toast . <sssss> all tasted amazing and are sure to please . <sssss> staff is very friendly and courteous no matter how busy they are . 
4		i really like hanny 's , even after my most recent experience there . <sssss> the bottom line is that hanny 's is a great place with good food and terrific classic-style cocktails . <sssss> the pimm 's cup is fantastic , for example . <sssss> the dj deserves mad props as well , and the whole place is fairly gorgeous . <sssss> i love the decor and the reclining booths . <sssss> basically this is a great spot for a bite and a couple drinks . <sssss> i 've had a couple pizzas , a sandwich , and a taste of the cauliflower veggie plate , and while nothing was exactly stand-out awesome , -lrb- although now that i say that my mind goes back to the meat-lovers ' pizza i sampled and my mouth starts watering ... -rrb- i would order any of it again . <sssss> the one uneven spot has been the service . <sssss> the first time i was ever here , only a month ago , we were served by a novice , and it showed . <sssss> painfully so . <sssss> the times i 've visited since , we 've had experienced servers who have done their job pretty well . 
4		i 've been a fan of pita jungle since my asu days , when i lived down the street from the apache location . <sssss> now i live in the arcadia area so this is the one we frequent . <sssss> i have n't noticed a huge difference between the two locations , same great food , same stoned servers . <sssss> my usual is the portabello burger . <sssss> the balsamic marinade they use is fantastic . <sssss> the presentation is a little messy , but once it hits your lips it 's so good . <sssss> i pass on the new potatoes for steamed spinach and it 's pretty amazing . <sssss> everyone knows the hummus rocks . <sssss> i love how they let you split up a small order between the roasted bell pepper and jalapeno cilantro . <sssss> it 's like a little hummus sampler for less than $ 5 . <sssss> the service can be spotty , especially when it comes to drink refills , but i 've surprisingly never had an order come out incorrectly . <sssss> i normally would not be surprised by this standard service expectation being consistently fulfilled , but i have had some baked servers here , so the fact that they can remember my steamed spinach substitution each and every time is kind of impressive . <sssss> so , good job , stoned servers . <sssss> maybe work on the drink thing , though . 
4		i have come to accept that self-serve frozen yogurt is the new model , but i still despise most of these types of shops . <sssss> having said that , friomio is probably one of -lrb- if not -rrb- the best of them . <sssss> it not only has a big selection of fro-yo and toppings , but the the few i tried were quite tasty and had good texture and constancy . <sssss> unlike most self-serve frozen yogurt shops , friomio 's yogurt is n't too soft , and does n't start melting seconds after you put it in your bowl . <sssss> i sampled the root beer float and pumpkin . <sssss> the root beer float , was perfect for what it was . <sssss> tasted just like a root beer float . <sssss> the pumpkin was awesome . <sssss> i decided to have peanut butter cup and birthday cake . <sssss> i 'm giving myself props for a great combo ! <sssss> the place is huge and clean . <sssss> i hate that 's tucked in the section of this complex with wildflower and hi-health . <sssss> parking is such a pain in this tiny section . <sssss> they do n't post their price anywhere , so get ready for possible register shock when you get ready to pay unless you ask . <sssss> friomio offers 20 % if you present a receipt from any of the many nearby restaurants . <sssss> so enjoy lunch or dinner at one of those places , then stop at friomio for dessert . <sssss> you 'll be glad you did . 
4		good , close to work , and cheap ! <sssss> i 'd recommend if you 're in the area for a quick lunch . <sssss> it 's tight quarters inside the restaurant so i find takeout to be the best -lrb- work is close so it 's easy to eat in the office -rrb- . <sssss> overall , i 'd definitely recommend . <sssss> i 've only ordered lunch which is very reasonably priced and very , very filling ! 
4		i have eaten several pizza places in the valley . <sssss> i like this location compared to the happy valley . <sssss> -lrb- that one seemed like the sauce was too salty -rrb- . <sssss> the wheat like bread opposed to white tastes yummy , and my husband much enjoyed the gluten free crust , as he has compared to many too . <sssss> the only downside was the cost $ 60 for two pizzas to get it the way you want because none of the specialties seemed like good enough standards the way they are . <sssss> after market bistro closing , hard to find a good pizza joint on this end of town . <sssss> this pizza reminds me of barros but just a little bit healthier version and i like really barros . <sssss> other places have too much grease on the pizza for my liking . 
4		i do n't know that i can add much to what i has already been shared so i 'll just say this . <sssss> wise guy = damn good pizza 
4		4/7/10 have i mentioned how i love the cranberry scones at wildflower bread co. ?? <sssss> they 're very moist and studded with gorgeous dried cranberries ... my favorite part to eat , being a crunchy food-lover , is the super-flaky , caramelized crust ! <sssss> the only reason i do n't rate w / 5 stars is because the last time i bought a few from this location , the crust flavor tasted `` off , '' as if another lipid was used to cook them with , or that the butter used was slightly rancid . <sssss> they definitely did not taste as fresh as the others i 've purchased here before . 
4		this mexican restaurant is close to my in-laws place so we recommended giving it a try one sunday after church . <sssss> we heard this was related to baja joe 's in mesa , but it is in fact not . <sssss> but the menu is almost identical . <sssss> we have been craving fish tacos , so we ordered the red snapper , whole fish , cooked in garlic . <sssss> they have very good quality tortillas i must say . <sssss> we used the tortillas to make a little burrito with the garlic fish and added the delicious chipotle sauce and habanero hot sauce to give it a good kick . <sssss> those were delicious . <sssss> i must say they could use a reassessment of the salad they serve because they were wilted and just did not look good . <sssss> the fish was also a bit smaller than i expected considering the price and when compared to baja joe 's . <sssss> i also got to try my brother-in-law 's shrimp burrito - enchilada style and i must say it was huge ! <sssss> also , they were generous with the perfectly cooked shrimp ! <sssss> my mother-in-law got the carne asada and that was cut pretty thin and was n't as juicy as i expected , so i do n't think i would recommend it . <sssss> the ambiance of the restaurant is basically as if you walked into mexico , it compliments the food in my opinion ! <sssss> the service was great , the waitress was very attentive and was very helpful when we had questions , even with a decently packed house . <sssss> i am definitely planning on coming back for another round , and i 'm glad we got to give it a try ! 
4		damn , those bartenders are hot ! <sssss> i 'd rather come here than a strip club . <sssss> the chicks are hotter -lrb- fitter -rrb- & i do n't have to watch anyone get naked . <sssss> i like that wide eyed innocent cowgirl look . <sssss> these girls are n't haggard or look like they 've just seen too much . <sssss> too bad this bar 's in tempe . <sssss> guys will chat you up & ask for your # but wo n't buy you a drink . <sssss> douchebaggery ! <sssss> oh , & if you stand up off your stool to pick something up some bleach blonde bimbo bitch in heels might try to steal it literally out from under you . <sssss> i 'm not talking about how you walked away from your stool & then someone else fairly claimed it . <sssss> i mean you 're still leaning over it about to sit back down . <sssss> got ta love those spoiled snobs that think they 're entitled ! 
4		great mexican food , get the carne asada burrito enchilada style . <sssss> the super nachos are awesome too . 
4		we have been taking our dogs to priority pet hospital for several years now . <sssss> we chose them for their expertise and level of care . <sssss> the office is a bit out the way for us but well worth the drive because of how our pets are treated . <sssss> we love that they thoroughly explain everything and give us lots of options for how to best care for our dogs . <sssss> thank you dr burns and dr griswold for taking such amazing care of our furry family members ! 
4		i was at my son 's basketball tournament and i have a complaining teenager about being hungry . <sssss> found the closest place i could . <sssss> i 've always wanted to try culver 's burgers cause i 've heard people talk about it . <sssss> anyways , order a single butter burger -lrb- does n't sound too healthy -rrb- with cheese and fries . <sssss> my daughter gobbled it up in less than a minute . <sssss> i though the burger was pretty good . <sssss> juicy and fresh . <sssss> not bad . <sssss> the fries were very crispy . <sssss> now i have another option when i have a burger craving . 
4		despite the fact that the sushi bar stools are for midgets and they gave me a dirty wine glass , it is quite possible that the sushi chefs at celsius fed me the most wonderful sushi i 've ever had in phoenix . <sssss> i tried the spicy yellow tail , spicy tuna , soft shell crab , crunchy special & one other roll that i cant remember . <sssss> all of it was superb . <sssss> the fish were fresh , the spice was just enough , the size of the rolls were perfect -lrb- i hate it when i cant fit the whole thing in my mouth ... -rrb- and i literally could n't stop eating it . <sssss> that 's when you know you 've found a gem - when you cant put your chopsticks down . <sssss> i 'm glad too because i have been waiting a long time to find a sushi spot here in the valley that i actually enjoy going to . <sssss> now if only @celsiussushibar would start updating their twitter with promised daily specials !! 
4		fast friendly service , good chicken bowls and you get a lot for your $ $ $ 
4		i 'm always up for a good sushi night , and with cafe wasabi so close to home , i tend to go there frequently . <sssss> the inside is fairly small , but it is decorated nicely . <sssss> it has a contemporary feel which is different from most other sushi restaurants i go to . <sssss> i usually order the dragon roll and the spicy tuna roll which i always enjoy . <sssss> the service is quick and the food is worth it . <sssss> the price is also cheap compared to your typical sushi bar . <sssss> i would certainly recommend it to fellow sushi-lovers . 
4		good burgers . <sssss> amazing malts ! 
4		this is a great place for some pizza and wings . <sssss> my most recent visit , i ordered a lunch special - a slice with garlic chicken , black olives , and roasted red peppers . <sssss> the pizza was good , and the toppings were solid . <sssss> it also included a half dozen wings , and i went with honey hot . <sssss> the wings are pretty tasty as well , and just a little bit different from most places - maybe a little crispier . <sssss> the breadsticks that came out early were also good . <sssss> this is definitely on my list for pizza , and with it being in delivery range , will be an option for days when i just do n't feel like cooking or leaving the house . 
4		whenever i crave chinese food , which is often because i am chinese , i hop in my car and drive 27.1 miles down to this place for several reasons . <sssss> 1 -rrb- it 's authentic . <sssss> 2 -rrb- it tastes reliably great every time i go . <sssss> 3 -rrb- there is n't another chinese place on the north side of town that serves anything comparably good . <sssss> i know the young college kid/busboy/waiter that madi d. mentioned and yeah , there are times when he 's a little space brained but it 's not intentional and for the most part , he 's pretty attentive to customers . <sssss> so yeah , the service may not be a 5 but once you get to know the people working there , they take care of you . <sssss> while i agree that it should n't matter because a patron is a patron but still - this is just how it is ... my favorite dishes from this place include : * eggplant and garlic sauce * beef stew * porridge * salty fish & chicken fried rice * four season beans * beef noodles * bitter melon it 's all very tasty and believe me , i would n't drive over 50 miles round trip several times a week just so i could yelp about it later . <sssss> i 've brought many friends and family here and will continue to do so in the future because it 's just that damn good . <sssss> if you see me there , feel free to introduce yourself , you can tell if i 'm there because my oil dripping car will be in the parking lot -lrb- read my review for right toyota ! -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> cheers ! <sssss> c 
4		been here a few times over the past 3 years and i have yet to have a bad experience . <sssss> the staff has always been courteous , prices are decent and the atmosphere is inviting . <sssss> my favorite time is happy hour . <sssss> the vig has a nice variety of food and beverages on their happy hour menu . <sssss> you can enjoy sitting inside or out in the covered yard area . <sssss> i prefer the yard area because it is more open . <sssss> i would give the vig 5 stars if it were n't for the lack of parking spaces and need to use their valet service . <sssss> i like to have the option . 
4		this is just overall a great place ! <sssss> it 's tough to do this review , as i can probably only remember 1/2 of my times being here , and that is being generous . <sssss> there 's something about the atmosphere here that just makes you want to tie one on and knock back giant beers and spend money playing songs , darts , and golden tee . <sssss> they also have pool and other games . <sssss> it 's a big bar . <sssss> there is a more `` game side '' and a more `` table/eating side '' . <sssss> they have a ton of tv 's that are large and high quality . <sssss> i have never seen it `` slow '' here . <sssss> it seems no matter what the day or time it 's pretty happening ! <sssss> the food is really good . <sssss> i love the diverse menu , happy hour specials , and quality ingredients . <sssss> i also have never once had bad service . <sssss> the staff is fast , friendly , and has never seemed irritated or overwhelmed . <sssss> there is a large patio out front that you can drink on that has misters and heat lamps -lrb- depends on the season -rrb- . <sssss> this is the absolute perfect place to go have a blast with friends , or even come alone when you feel the need for a night out . <sssss> always friendly , attentive , and ... oops i forgot the rest because i always end up giggly and drunk . <sssss> sigh . 
4		i went here on a recommendation from a friend . <sssss> i am a huge fan . <sssss> loved the hummus app . <sssss> and the noodle shrimp dish was excellent . <sssss> the staff ran like a well oiled machine moving , serving , smiling without missing a beat . <sssss> the decor and staff attire gave a soothing and updated feel . <sssss> topped it off with the most excellent bannana pistachio nut muffin that i am going back for any time i am even in the area ! <sssss> good is good ! <sssss> i also tried the true food kitchen on scottsdale road and loved it too but if i had to choose between the two of them i would make my way to this one first . 
4		i am so happy our town finally has a sushi bar . <sssss> the sushi chef has been doing this for most of his life , beginning his career in seattle . <sssss> they shop the world for the best fresh fish and have great creations . <sssss> if you do n't see what you like , just tell them and they will create rolls for you . <sssss> great customer service . <sssss> rolls are reasonably priced . <sssss> tell iris that jim and mollie sent you . 
4		thai elephant has made its way onto my `` special friday lunch '' rotation -- an honored list of my favorite places for takeout and get me out of the office lunch spots -- and i could n't be happier . <sssss> a coworker told me about the place , and after trying trying their yellow curry , i was hooked . <sssss> now , i 'm no connoisseur of curry , but i know what i like and i know what my taste buds like , and this curry was faaan-tastic . <sssss> i ordered it mild because my taste buds are a tad sensitive , but that did n't take away from the robust flavors . <sssss> the simple ingredients of the dish melded together beautifully to create a spectacularly savory meal . <sssss> and , it was quite the portion for a lunch item . <sssss> i had to save half of it , which i was hoping to have for dinner , but accidentally left in the work fridge . <sssss> i 'm already thinking about when i 'll order from thai elephant again , and maybe the next time i 'll venture outside my curry comfort zone to try some other menu items . <sssss> but , then again , why deny myself the joy of their curry ! 
4		tried the happy hour on a thursday and got there about 5:30 . <sssss> the place was empty except for another couple that was already there . <sssss> the place was nice and seemed cleaned . <sssss> as we were seated i realized how big the place was . <sssss> there is a alcohol bar near the front and the sushi bar near the rear . <sssss> we ordered several rolls . <sssss> actually ordered 2 too many as we had to take some leftovers to go . <sssss> the nigiri was good . <sssss> we also liked the spicy tuna . <sssss> my wife liked the sweet potato roll which had no fish in it . <sssss> we liked the chili/garlic edamame and the aloe martini and recommend it . 
4		what you wo n't guess from the name is that the coffee shop is actually on a community farm called agritopia . <sssss> the farm has a story and has been there a while . <sssss> the original stone farmhouse buildings are now used for it 's restaurants , the coffee shop and the grill . <sssss> for the coffee shop , definitely farm fresh and organic , simple and tasty , not fussy . <sssss> everything we ordered was very good . <sssss> this is not a gourmet coffee shop , to me it 's more of a farm styled urban café . <sssss> and they have cupcakes ... i 'm a fan of a good cupcake . <sssss> my shock was seeing that in fact , the lady working the kitchen line , was a face i recognized from cupcakes wars . <sssss> she was very gracious and came around to take a picture with me . <sssss> i had a lot of fun with that encounter since i 'm a big fan of the show and had seen the episode she competed on . <sssss> besides the coffee shop and joe 's farm grill -lrb- which i only saw walking past , separate building , same farm -rrb- , you 'll see the community gardens , labeled plants growing everywhere , paths to walk on , very nice . <sssss> they also have farmer 's markets twice weekly . <sssss> i found the place to be charming , the food tasty , and the people very nice . <sssss> go visit the farm for breakfast , sit in it 's historical buildings , admire the cool urban garden concept . <sssss> you 'll be glad you did . <sssss> eat well and prosper ! 
4		it 's tucked away , but do n't let that stop you . <sssss> we order from here a lot , and their food is awesome ! <sssss> i 've had the bacon-onion ring - bbq sauce burger more thatn i can remember , and i can never make the same thing at home ! <sssss> kudos guys , and keep up the speedy service ! 
4		took my godchild and had a blast . <sssss> the servers were cheerful , delightful and gave great suggestions and surprised us with various concoctions of fountain drinks that were delicious . <sssss> we had the macburger and hot pastrami sandwiched . <sssss> we had such a good time after our school tour we returned for ice cream soda 's . <sssss> breakfast at tiffany 's and casablanca were scrumptious . <sssss> go eat and shop for vintage clothes and jewelry . <sssss> had no idea this quaint gem was so close to my office . 
4		solid 4 stars , the food is almost 5 stars . <sssss> the decor and dish ware are lacking but it 's a hole in the wall what do you expect ?? <sssss> first visit was two weeks ago and i took the family back twice since . <sssss> it 's definitely worth checking out ... oh yeah , $ 3 house margaritas and $ 4 small pitchers of beer ----- good times 
4		if you are going west on i-8 , this carl 's jr is tucked behind the mcdonald 's and a love 's travel stop . <sssss> it 's also the first restaurant on the left if you are headed east . <sssss> so , it 's very easy to miss if you blink your eye while passing through this ` lil ` ole town . <sssss> i 'm not quite sure why the steel decor in the restroom -lrb- sink and urinal -rrb- look like they belong at a rest-stop or prison cell -lrb- the gila bend mcdonalds definitely has a better looking restroom -rrb- , but if you need to drop a bomb , chances are that you will have more privacy here . <sssss> the customer service was also a little off - large parties are allowed to stand near the register and stare at the menu while those in the line who are ready to order are left waiting . <sssss> other than all that , it 's your typical carl 's junior . <sssss> bon appétit ! 
4		wow , i really fell in love with cien agave because of their awesome selection of exotic mexican veg options ! <sssss> i can usually find a few vegetarian items at most restaurants but they 're usually just ok . <sssss> what i had at this place was phenomenal ! <sssss> for example their pappas con queso -lrb- seasoned potatoes and cheese -rrb- and their grilled veggie tacos were can you say mouthwateringly awesome ?! <sssss> also , they have the most deliciously fresh and exotic salad dressing made of a prickly pear vinaigrette . <sssss> but , my fave of all was their creamy poblano soup , was just the perfect amount of spicy mixed with creamy that has your mouth saying `` ahhhh '' and `` mmmmm '' after each spoonful . <sssss> looking forward to trying some of their other tasty food creations and drinks at my fabulously new food crush place ! 
4		if you like `` make your own '' salads with a huge variety of fresh toss-ins and flavorful dressings , then market bistro is your place . <sssss> the salads -lrb- $ 7.99 -rrb- can get a wee bit pricey when you start adding in proteins -lrb- $ 2.29 -rrb- , but they 're very big ... enough for your entire meal , or even to share as a light meal . <sssss> i 've also tasted their tortilla soup , and it 's wonderful , and i know others who enjoy their sandwiches . 
4		shotgun betty 's rocks . <sssss> i 've been there twice and had fun both times . <sssss> the first was during our 80 's bar crawl and the second during my jungle mania birthday prowl . <sssss> we were n't charged a cover either nights . <sssss> the very , very young wait staff and bartenders take turns dancing on the bar . <sssss> i prefer the bartenders at the dirty dogg saloon because they are older and more skilled , but i had a good time at shotgun betty 's regardless of the bartenders young age and lack of dancing skills . <sssss> the music is great -lrb- rock and country rock -rrb- and the age of the crowd varies . <sssss> i will definitely return . 
4		if you can find it , you were meant to eat here . <sssss> tucked away in the scottsdale mall -lrb- aka outdoor plaza -rrb- is low-key , friendly , and delicious breakfast . <sssss> we had the corn beef hash with spciy jalapenos and the buttermilk pancakes -lrb- tasted almost like sweet delicate crumpets -rrb- . <sssss> everything was amazing and service was professional but easy going . <sssss> they are very dog friendly on the patio , which i personally do n't get but people seemed happy to have their pooches with them . <sssss> and , the espresso was the best we had since leaving sedona . <sssss> yum ! 
4		damn fine for a drive-thru . <sssss> i expected the hot dog to be robust , but it was thinner than a typical bar-s hot dog . <sssss> they do not skimp on the toppings though , very fine ! <sssss> the italian beef was better than average , but short of remarkable . <sssss> all in all , damn fine for a drive-thru . 
4		i am an adventurous eater and i love ethnic food ... this was a new experience . <sssss> the waitress was extremely helpful in picking out the dish that would allow my friend and me to try many different things . <sssss> i loved eating with my fingers , well using the bread to scoop up each of the dishes . <sssss> this is a place worth trying . 
4		it 's all about the chicken fried steak - for breakfast , of course , because that is the only meal for chicken fried steak , and this is most definitely the best chicken fried steak in arizona . <sssss> period . <sssss> forget texaz grill - that place sucks in comparison . <sssss> being a bonafide okie with a serious white trash pedigree , i know good fried trashy food when i eats it . <sssss> oh and the crotchety ` flo ' like waitresses are a big bonus . 
4		i do n't get it . <sssss> have my taste buds really started to fail me ? <sssss> there are very few good reviews for this location , and i simply do n't get it . <sssss> and the thing i do n't get even more than the bad reviews , are the lack of people in this restaurant . <sssss> i went back again yesterday , had a delicious meal , and there was not a sole there . <sssss> ok , so it was at noon ! <sssss> i get the protein power plate . <sssss> yes it is healthy , but it is also delicious . <sssss> the chicken and onions come on top of a plate of zoe 's slaw . <sssss> the zoe 's slaw is awesome . <sssss> a light coleslaw that has tons of feta . <sssss> to be honest , this is all that i have had here , but when i want a healthy meal and i have already hit up pita jungle twice that week , there is nothing better than a little bit of zoe 's . <sssss> people support this establishment , it is realistically priced , has good quality food that is tasty and nutritious . 
4		if you 're in the area this is a must stop spot for breakfast or lunch . <sssss> located in an adorable courtyard you feel transported to another place . <sssss> they have indoor tables mixed amongst an eclectic mix of decor and great patio which is where you should sit if it 's not to hot . <sssss> i enjoyed the eggs & french toast and my friend had the eggs & pancake . <sssss> with coffee breakfast will run you $ 10 . <sssss> it 's a great deal . <sssss> oh , and they serve hot syrup - so good . 
4		why this place does n't get more stars is beyond me . <sssss> hello , people -- they have a rotating lounge on the top !! <sssss> the lobby has nice decor and the rooms are very comfortable -lrb- although mine is dark , which is why i took away on star -rrb- . <sssss> the exercise room is great , with up-to-date machines and the pool is lovely . <sssss> me likes ! 
4		my review is limited based on happy hour and general layout of the place . <sssss> i did not get a chance to check out food . <sssss> overall , kind of a neat , casual , funky layout . <sssss> nice indoor bar area , and really cool outdoor patio . <sssss> and of course it was very crowded on the patio . <sssss> parking in a pain , go with valet , you really have no choice . <sssss> but it is free and fast . <sssss> wish they had more of their own beers , but i did try their ipa and it was good . <sssss> overall , i liked the place , and will go back for food/dinner in the near future . 
4		the menu is really good for a chain restaurant . <sssss> the bagels are fresh , the choices of sandwiches is very good and the coffee is the best in town . <sssss> if you bring your own travel mug , it 's only a buck . <sssss> staff is friendly however sometimes they get confused about menu items and that leads to mistakes . 
4		right inside the mekong plaza when you go through the main entrance . <sssss> this place is my alternative to lee lee when i do not want to drive down to chandler and comes in second place on my scorecard . <sssss> i shop here to get special items when trying to reproduce a restaurant favorite and can not find the ingredients in my regular stores . <sssss> inside can be a little cramped with all the items stacked up like skyscrapers . <sssss> place is typically pretty clean . <sssss> they have quite a few options when looking for what you need . <sssss> the produce is relatively fresh and most interesting . <sssss> i have had pretty good luck with the fish in the meat section as well . <sssss> great value and good prices . <sssss> normally come here to get stuff to cook thai food , vietnamese or other tasty asian cuisines . <sssss> they have a giant selection of herbs , peppers , etc. as well as authentic sauces and seasonings . <sssss> nice ! <sssss> my only complaint is they like to mix the different ethnic regions together on the same aisle . <sssss> for instance , if it comes in a jar , look for the jar section . <sssss> whereas lee lee has them on there own separate aisles to avoid confusion . <sssss> also check the expiration dates if you can . <sssss> some items do not get the fifo experience . <sssss> seems like i am seeing this everywhere now days . <sssss> best part is everyone gets 10 % off when you check out and there are plenty of places to eat if you are hungry right outside the store . <sssss> the restaurant called thai spices is my favorite . <sssss> tally ho ! <sssss> 3.75 stars 
4		having been here a few times , i 'm definitely between `` yay ! <sssss> i 'm a fan . '' <sssss> and `` a-ok '' . <sssss> dessert : really good . <sssss> croissants : fairly good . <sssss> coffee : needs help . <sssss> i 've enjoyed every dessert i 've had here . <sssss> the croissants are usually good , but a few times the dough has tasted decidedly pasta-like and not so fluffy . <sssss> the coffee really lets down the noms . <sssss> i prefer to get my coffee over at cartel down the street and bring it with me or vice-versa . 
4		i 've been here a few times but this is my first review . <sssss> the pizza is definitely tasty - nothing frozen here . <sssss> we did receive iffy service once but my other experiences were positive . 
4		i 've been in a few times but only to grab something and go . <sssss> on friday , i spent the entire afternoon there drinking a perfect chai and studying . <sssss> i was astonished at how perfect the atmosphere was for studying . <sssss> i got a lot done . <sssss> i enjoyed the music . <sssss> i think i 'll be back soon . 
4		good prices for gas , ice cold drinks , plenty of quick snacks , and easy to get in and out of from grand ave. 
4		the sweet aroma of smoking meats hit my olfactory senses immediately upon entering this place . <sssss> a small quaint plaza restaurant apparently family run . <sssss> the large pulled pork sandwich -lrb- the papa jack -rrb- was great . <sssss> plenty o ' smoke and good sauce on the side . <sssss> the beans were good as well as the fries . <sssss> it seems as a whole , that bbq joints skimp a little on the sides . <sssss> i do n't know why , but this should be looked into and remedied . <sssss> they were n't awfully small but just enough to get a decent taste . <sssss> the owner talked to me a bit to make sure i enjoyed the meal . <sssss> very friendly . <sssss> i think he was from chicago , not sure . <sssss> they have some interesting things on the menu i definitely want to try , like the hawg dawg - a deep fried sausage with cheese and bacon . <sssss> i will be back when my cholesterol is down a bit . 
4		ok myself and a group of friends were craving thai food and we literally trawled the interwebz looking for somewhere nice ... . <sssss> and this was the first one we came to . <sssss> since we had spent 3 hours deciding , by this point we were starving so just went with it . <sssss> when we called in our take-out order we were told - `` hold on and i 'll go ask mom if we can do that '' ... . <sssss> . <sssss> so we thought eeeek . <sssss> not good . <sssss> but !!!! <sssss> when we got there we discovered a top-notch , fancy , uber-modern and stylish eatery with a nice atmosphere and very friendly staff . <sssss> so we think that essentially they do n't do phone-in 's as such and they were just being really nice !!!! <sssss> so at the end of the day we struck gold - prices were awesome and the same as what we had paid for plates of junk from other places . <sssss> portions are good - not too big for a girl like me , but was not quite big enough for my 6 ' 3 '' man . <sssss> parking is non-existent but i guess thats just the area roundabout -lrb- we are new to the area from scotland so still finding our feet ... . -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> was so yum our friend phoned back 3 days later for another takeaway . <sssss> return business from us - sorted . 
4		great little place . <sssss> all the sushi was good , but the flying fish roe was put together loose and the eggs spilled in my soy sauce :[ but they were still good . <sssss> very friendly sushi chefs . 
4		thank you god for blessing me with this whole foods a block away from my house . <sssss> the food is amazing , fresh , yummy , healthy -lrb- most of it -rrb- and just awesome . <sssss> the kitchen area has hot food , premade food to go , a ridiculous salad bar with awesome pasta salads , the sushi is surprisingly fresh and really well priced too !!! <sssss> their sandwiches are simply orgasmic . <sssss> they also have fresh pizza , taco bar , and bakery . <sssss> we 've also gone to the thursday tasting at the wine bar - yes , this grocery store has a wine bar - and had an absolute blast for 10 bucks . <sssss> with candles and ambiance you forget you 're even in a grocery store ! <sssss> cheese selection is great and the person working the counter usually knows all about the cheeses and how to point you in the right direction . <sssss> the beverage selection is awesome , from water to wine to beer . <sssss> to top it all off , the staff is amazingly friendly and helpful - they make shopping there a glorious experience . <sssss> when grocery shopping though , watch the prices - some things are amazingly well priced -lrb- go for the 365 brand -rrb- while others are simply absurd . <sssss> heads up on the construction going on scottsdale road right now - it can make it a pain to get in and out . 
4		the staff is very friendly . <sssss> i like that . <sssss> love the current quiz question they have hanging right inside the door . <sssss> if you know the answer think your order is free . 
4		living just a half mile away for the past few years , i really had no excuse to avoiding mi patio for so long . <sssss> i tend to stay away from any place that chips are considered a course in your meal and deep fried is a cooking method . <sssss> while i still stick to this mothodology , its nice to break pace every few weeks to keep your sanity . <sssss> i mean , you cant live on veggies for too long without getting a craving for something tasty , meaty , and full of carbs . <sssss> mi patio was just the spot . <sssss> we ordered a spinach and cheese chimi and a couple orders of their tacos ; chicken and beef . <sssss> after filling up on chips and chowing down the great tasting tacos , we could n't even begin to eat the chimi . <sssss> while my expectations for a next day chimichanga was n't so high up there , it was actually still good the next day . <sssss> i imagine that it would have been all the better had i eaten it fresh from the kitchen . <sssss> maybe next time ill go light on the chips . <sssss> ive heard their $ 1.75 margaritas a decent ; however , i can not personally attest to this . <sssss> at $ 1.75 it ca n't hurt to give it a try though . <sssss> either way you slice it , mi patio is a solid choice for your mexican delights . 
4		have you ever wondered `` what is behind those hooters ? '' <sssss> in peoria it is a great little sports bar . <sssss> small friendly and decent crowd . <sssss> i saw mostly 21-40 year old folks having a good time . <sssss> there are the regulars and the staff takes care of them . <sssss> they have a decent sized patio and a few video games too . 
4		yummy . <sssss> i got a crepe with mushroom and swiss cheese , soooo good . <sssss> shared an order of sweet potato fries , only thing missing was a delicious sauce to dip them in . <sssss> i like that they have the screen up where you can watch the crepes being made for you . <sssss> they have a small stage for evening performances . <sssss> they were having a comedian that night according to the host . <sssss> good service along with good food , ca n't ask for much more than that . <sssss> i will be going back to try the fondue and different crepes . 
4		i finally followed my beloved baseball giants of san francisco to their spring training home , and after consulting scottsdale yelpers , culinary dropout seemed like a good place to eat a late dinner on the first night . <sssss> living in the south bay area , i generally assumed that relatively low population density equates to nothing but stripmalls and chain restaurants . <sssss> going to scottsdale has shown me that this does n't have to be the case . <sssss> i do realize that the fox group is a major presence in the food and nightlife scene in scottsdale . <sssss> this preeminence clearly is n't gained by aggressive annoying ad campaigns and stupid slogans ... or by offering horrendously large portions to lure in lazy , poor , obese people . <sssss> they are successful , i imagine , because they take a good concept and consistently deliver it to locals and tourists alike at a reasonable price . <sssss> i likes me some swanky san francisco restaurants , where you feel like you have to prove your worthiness to the server . <sssss> and then you fork out $ 180 bucks and step over homeless people to get to your cab . <sssss> culinary dropout satisfies the swanky without the price or the pretentious service -lrb- not to mention the lack of homeless drug addicts passed-out in a puddle of their own excrement -rrb- . <sssss> thank you scottsdale pd police state ! <sssss> i started with the ` nutty irishman ' cocktail , if i remember correctly . <sssss> jamison with guiness reduction and some other stuff . <sssss> never heard of adding a guiness reduction to a cocktail ... or reducing guiness at all , but i am a fan . <sssss> my special lady had the cocktail with the pomegranate foam on top ... step aside ferran adria , this is the best use of foam i can think of . <sssss> the cuban pork belly sandwich appealed to me ... you had me at pork belly . <sssss> my dainty little girlfriend had the chopped italian salad . <sssss> my sandwich was bomb-diggidy , although i was less-than-impressed with the chopped salad with kraft-tasting italian dressing on it ... but i would never order that , so i 'm not hating . <sssss> while i 'm on it , wtf is with every single scottsdale restaurant putting some kind of ` chopped ' salad on their menu ? <sssss> just sayin ' . <sssss> that seems like some iceberg , cucumber , and carrot thing you put ranch on in the midwest somewhere . <sssss> i digress . <sssss> i was too full to try the monkey bread ... my mom makes that , and i love it . <sssss> we had to come back another night to try it , and it did not disappoint . <sssss> and neither did the people-watching on a friday night . <sssss> they must have a 23yr old blond girl generator somewhere in this town . <sssss> the title tells it all : culinary dropout . <sssss> not that they ca n't cook here , it 's that they do n't feel the need to put on their tall hat and adhere to some antiquated notion of cuisine . <sssss> they make good food that people like in a festive and swanky atmosphere . <sssss> just because they have an amazing space and a well-thought-out and well-invested aesthetic concept , that does n't mean they have to try and make inaccessible food that you need to download the oxford food-lovers app on your iphone to translate the menu . <sssss> and every employee i interacted with was oozing with genuine hospitality . <sssss> next year when i come back , and i will come back , i will definitely stop by again . 
4		was trying to decide where to go to lunch with a friend and i recited a list of close places -lrb- courtesy of the yelp app of course -rrb- . <sssss> i named rice paper and he immediately said let 's go . <sssss> he had tried on two different occasions and could n't find parking . <sssss> so he left without going in . <sssss> this was possibly his chance and i always up for a new vietnamese joint . <sssss> when we got there just after 11 am , there were a few spots available . <sssss> it is a small place and the main dining area was fairly packed . <sssss> so we chose the front room that had no one else in it . <sssss> service was average . <sssss> the hostess -lrb- ? -rrb- <sssss> was pleasant . <sssss> our server was not pleasant , not unpleasant . <sssss> he was simply there . <sssss> for some reason he continually walked into the front room , looked straight at the for door for a few seconds and would walk back . <sssss> so there and a bit strange . <sssss> the menu is not truly vietnamese . <sssss> it 's the way i envision p.f. chang 's would develop an urban hipster vietnamese place . <sssss> i went with a chicken sandwich . <sssss> frankly i was hit with sticker shock when i saw the $ 8 price . <sssss> i 'm used to $ 4 sandwiches from the more `` traditional '' places . <sssss> and to through in a plot twist i went with the staple of vietnamese side dishes , garlic fries . <sssss> but , i must say that the food was very good . <sssss> the sandwich was over twice the size of the $ 4 snack sandwiches i was used to and they actually put a decent amount of chicken in it . <sssss> the jalapeños were fresh . <sssss> the garlic fries were fantastic . <sssss> the best i have had . <sssss> they were n't soggy like most places . <sssss> they were crispy without an overpowering amount of garlic . <sssss> a + for the food . <sssss> so overall the food is fantastic , but the parking -lrb- it took us a while to maneuver out way out after some creative parking from others -rrb- and service are n't . <sssss> i may also be biased by what i perceive to be an attempt by restaurant owners to create buzz by setting up shop in tiny downtown houses with inadequate parking . <sssss> you know that whole yogism , `` no one goes there anymore , it 's too crowded . '' 
4		if you were to build a perfect dive bar / historic az bar this would be your place . <sssss> it has become a favorite of mine , filled with fun people and a friendly and kind staff . <sssss> great place to bring out of towners for a taste of the old west and a $ 9 pitcher of kiltlfter . 
4		fun place to go to late at night when you 're in need of delicious food . <sssss> their hours are unconventional , making it a great place for a late night snack . <sssss> every time i 've gone they 've run out of some ingredients , which is disappointing but indicates that they have delicious food . <sssss> i would describe this place as a hole in the wall , hippie , gourmet nacho place . <sssss> sounds strange , but you 'll like it . 
4		superb job by the copper blues staff during last night 's grand opening . <sssss> the crowd was asses to elbows but we never waited terribly long for snacks or drinks . <sssss> when you consider it was a hosted bar and the girls probably were n't making a ton of money in tips their effort becomes even more admirable . <sssss> if you like a beer selection that runs 60 + deep , eclectic music , a killer patio with downtown views , and wading in a sea of attractive people , odds are strong you 'll have a good experience at copper blues . <sssss> it really is a beautiful space with exposed ceilings , rich wood floors , gorgeous bars areas , and sumptuous attended bathrooms . <sssss> aaron may 's menu is still a bit of an unknown based on last night 's samplers but it 's hard to doubt the man responsible for so many restaurant successes -lrb- vitamin t , over easy , mabel 's on main , etc. -rrb- . <sssss> the big man was in attendance last night overseeing the finger food service , which included caprese on crackers -lrb- meh -rrb- , meatballs -lrb- strong -rrb- , tuna tartare -lrb- spicy and delicious -rrb- and sweet pea guacamole -lrb- five stars -rrb- . <sssss> i 'm looking forward to getting busy with one of his entrees soon . <sssss> copper blues is a big win for downtown . 
4		very sad to say , that it seems siracha has closed for the time being . <sssss> the windows are papered up & a note on the door says closed for two months . <sssss> sad . 
4		very interesting place . <sssss> not the crowd you 'd expect but worth checking out . <sssss> after seeing this place straight up popping on a frist friday , i knew i needed to come in and try it out . <sssss> the patio is a funky mosiac of painted concrete squares with a small yard with park picnic tables all in range of some loud speaker playing music from inside . <sssss> when you first walk in the place seems realy small and tight , and that 's because it is . <sssss> take a left and you 'll find more booth style seating but walk forward and you can prop up on the counter and order . <sssss> everything looks like its about to fall off the shelves or just fall asleep ... including the guy behind the table . <sssss> there 's a little wall fridge of sodas and baked goods then the expresso machines and syrup racks line the backsplash of the bar area . <sssss> do n't get the wrong idea , dude behind the counter is cool as hell . <sssss> came up to me and asked what i 'd like , told him something sweet and he immediately starting hooking me up with options and built an bomb caramel iced coffee . <sssss> was nice and asked if i drank whole milk ... how sweet . <sssss> from what i saw coming from the kitch , this joint is cranking out stellar food . <sssss> wish i could have stayed for breakfast . <sssss> will def come back here on a day i 'm not dressed for work and i can look like a bum too . <sssss> thanks counter guy for not making me feel weird for being the only girl in there . 
4		my favorite neighborhood watering hole . <sssss> food has greatly improved over the two years i 've been coming here . <sssss> great service . 
4		this is an excellent spa choice . <sssss> i 've visited enough across the us and love that this one is in our hometown . <sssss> one of my favorite elements is the waiting lounge on the second floor . <sssss> i love the uber-plush furniture , dim lighting and shaded windows -lrb- it helps you forget how miserably hot it is outside ! -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> you 'll want to move in and never leave . <sssss> treatments have always been top-notch . <sssss> this spa has a private pool and cafe service , which is another great perk that a number of spas out here actually do not have . 
4		impressive dinner tonight ! <sssss> however , it was a packed house , and it took over an hour for my panang curry to arrive . <sssss> while i was a part of a large group of about 14 , our particular group had 6 people . <sssss> one tablemate 's entree -lrb- ginger veggie stir-fry ? -rrb- <sssss> arrived at least 20 minutes before the second tablemate saw hers -lrb- yellow curry -rrb- . <sssss> it was at least another ten minutes before the third tablemate saw his , and so on ... i was able to sample my neighbors ' dishes of spicy catfish -lrb- battered and fried catfish topped w / bell peppers , basil , and spicy red curry sauce -rrb- and swimming rama w / pork -lrb- topped w / peanut sauce over steamed veggies -rrb- . <sssss> all three were amazing ! <sssss> i 'll definitely order the rama and the catfish next time !!! <sssss> didi , our server , moved quickly , was efficient , and attentive , and was even helpful in suggesting alternate selections to those who had never had thai food before . <sssss> she even warned tablemate ericka , who 'd only recently discovered peanut butter as an entree ingredient , that she 'd either love or hate the rama . <sssss> we were thankful that she rolled the dice and ordered it , anyway . <sssss> i hope that the kitchen crew can work out the kinks as far as pacing goes-i hope that by next visit i can up the review back to five stars !! <sssss> ooh , do try the coconut ice cream w / embedded grated coconut ! <sssss> not as good as yupha 's homemade coconut ice cream , but still quite delightful : -rrb- 
4		i want to preface my review with the fact that my mediterranean knowledge is based on a handful of places in the valley ; some better than others , -lrb- in my opinion -rrb- . <sssss> at the risk of the yelp * ing community throwing themselves off camelback mountain , i have to say that pita jungle sort of sets the bar for me when it comes to overall taste , portion size , and quality . <sssss> having said that , i was fortunate to try hummus xpress -lrb- hard to take the place serious with the name -rrb- this afternoon . <sssss> based on the reviews alone , i was expecting a lot and was not disappointed . <sssss> live music , handful of tables , not much of a line and fairly straightforward system of ordering . <sssss> if you read more than two other reviews , i do n't have to repeat the process . <sssss> it was nice to get some guidance from the line , though i was a little confused by the pricing aspect : .60 cents per item on veggies . <sssss> i was n't clear if that was across the menu or just that region but i was so aware of it that it kept me from really wanting to pile on anymore than a single veggie . <sssss> portion size was adequate , the bowl can hold a lot of food and you fill the bowl easily with delicious ingredients . <sssss> i sampled a few flavors of hummus and too be honest , i prefer my hummus warm which this was not but was still tasty . <sssss> what seems like a limited menu actually is fairly vast and it would be possible to have the same thing twice only by accident . <sssss> pitas were soft and warm and the iced tea was special . <sssss> push-button iced tea is an abomination so it was nice to see handwritten exotic flavors that did n't make you roll your eyes . <sssss> hummus xpress -lrb- * sigh -rrb- is now in the rotation and on the board for a good quality lunch . 
4		great place to hang out on a weekend morning . <sssss> many great choices . <sssss> good muffins to go if you are in a hurry . 
4		good sandwiches ... i 'm a fan of the midwest best and the white widow . <sssss> been going here for a long time and anyone looking at reviews trying to decide ... just go and give it a shot man ! <sssss> it 's a fun experience and the food is good , everyone is going there ... no peer pressure !!! <sssss> :-rrb- they should have one of these in every campus town ! 
4		luci 's is a great little healthy market in north central area of phoenix . <sssss> we went for lunch one day during the week since they have a little cafe inside the market . <sssss> service is kind of slow , but the food was good . <sssss> the atmosphere is interesting since you sit pretty much in the market . <sssss> it 's got a cute `` vintage/hipster '' look to it . <sssss> i love it but want to hate it at the same time . <sssss> does that make sense ? <sssss> phoenix is fast becoming a `` hipster-esk '' type of city , and this joint falls right in line with that feel . <sssss> i want to not like it , but i do ... ... ok i 'm rambling . <sssss> check them out , the food is good . 
4		i come here every thursday to bowl with friends . <sssss> i am not on a league or anything , just some guys tossing balls down the lane . <sssss> the staff is cool -lrb- they better be cool since we come every week and bring people with us -rrb- . <sssss> the bar is fairly decent and so is the kitchen . <sssss> the lanes are nice . <sssss> the bad : i like to consider myself somewhat serious . <sssss> i am not the best bowler by any means . <sssss> however , since this location is close to asu it seems to attract the jock-straps who think it is cool to shot-put a 6lb ball half way down the lane at 35mph . <sssss> i can not stand this . <sssss> not only does it fawk up my concentration but it damages the lanes . <sssss> besides , it makes you look like a douche -lrb- well maybe not to your plastic girlfriend -rrb- . <sssss> overall , permitting i can get in a lane far away from the mcdouches , i have a good time ... alone or with a party . 
4		oh man ! <sssss> these wings were delicious !! <sssss> extreme honey habanero . <sssss> loved the flavor . <sssss> and i am so impressed with how they are cooked . <sssss> nice and crispy , but not overcooked and not greasy at all . <sssss> just yummy ! <sssss> and the gals who helped me at the counter were just darling !! <sssss> really good service and super , super sweet . <sssss> the mac and cheese bites were n't anything to write home about ... the cheese just is n't good . <sssss> but hey , what do you want for $ 2.99 ? <sssss> they were tasty , but not to die for by any means . <sssss> jalapeño poppers the same thing ... just okay . <sssss> but i would definitely recommend this place for the wings . <sssss> and i ca n't wait to go back and try the fish ! <sssss> the gal that worked there raved about it . <sssss> oh ! <sssss> and i want to try the fried okra ! <sssss> mmmmmmmmmmmm ... 
4		loved the presentation of the food . <sssss> everything was so unique ! <sssss> we had a nice view outside as well . <sssss> our server was friendly even after we only had water for a beverage . <sssss> we had the lobster bisque , filet , short ribs , a side of mashed potatoes , and the creme brulee dessert . <sssss> everything was great ! <sssss> the creme brulee had a bit too much of an alcohol taste to it . <sssss> oh , and the bread given at the beginning was delicious !!! 
4		upon walking in , i smiled and said hello to the hostess , and she just blankly stared at me . <sssss> i had a brief flashback to my time spent hosting , and i felt as if our roles had been reversed . <sssss> but , i digress . <sssss> our server , taylor , was very sweet and helpful with explaining our sauces , and even checked with the cooks to see if i could get spring rolls without the duck -lrb- which , sadly was not possible -rrb- . <sssss> their vegetarian options were decent and clearly labeled . <sssss> food was good . <sssss> ginger beer tasted like bar sweet and sour mix . <sssss> i might come back . 
4		great job , awesome prices , lovely staff ! 
4		this review is n't so much about the actual science center , but that 's really cool . <sssss> this is a warning . <sssss> if you are going in the morning during the school year , call first to check if there are school groups going that day . <sssss> when we went , there were several hundred kids there and it was absolute mayhem . <sssss> if you go after 1 pm or so , or if there are no school groups that day , then absolutely go , this place is awesome . <sssss> do n't go if any school groups are going to be there , though . <sssss> it 's unbelievably loud and you wo n't get to interact with any of the exhibits . 
4		i love riding the light rail and dining at establishments that do n't allow firearms . <sssss> why ? <sssss> because i 'm liberal scum . <sssss> facetious political banter aside , i think that the light rail is a great addition to phoenix . <sssss> not everyone is able to take advantage of it due to its limited proximity , but she 's still but a pup and will expand in due time over the years . <sssss> as it is now , the light rail has really been a major help to me and very convenient . <sssss> i 've taken it downtown many , many times , have used it to hit up the swap meet -lrb- that was awesome -rrb- , go to a baseball game and dine out at places i ordinarily could n't make it to as a bike commuter . <sssss> i remember when it was brand spanking new , everyone on there was riding it for the sheer spectacle of it . <sssss> now , though , drunken lunatics feel welcome aboard . <sssss> they 're not all that common , they 're not in that majority , but if you ride the light rail enough , you will see your handful of raving , yelling-at-the-moon type maniacs . <sssss> for me , it adds character . <sssss> i hope to see it branch out in the years that come . 
4		great food and freindly service and good prices . <sssss> highly reccommend . 
4		stopped by for lunch with a friend and baby in tow . <sssss> the patio seemed like a great place to chill with friends but it was too hot for the baby so we sat inside . <sssss> we decided on the chicken wraps -lrb- friend did -rrb- and i devoured the grilled eggplant sandwich . <sssss> eggplant and goat cheese , a winning combination . <sssss> we were satisfied with our meals and only wished we could have stayed longer . 
4		well is ace hardware , i love them all . <sssss> i got to say this one is one of the good once \ . <sssss> nice job 
4		i really like this place ... and need to come here more often ! <sssss> free wifi , lots of outlets , good food and drink , and i like the ambiance and layout . <sssss> most importantly , the espresso drink i ordered -lrb- an iced mocha -rrb- was very good . <sssss> not the most mocha-y flavor , but i can always order with extra mocha next time . <sssss> yay for finding a cool new place ! 
4		i love harkins camelview theater ; it 's the independent/foreign film theater house to go to ! <sssss> yes it 's a harkins theater , but it gives off a little bit more of an artsy swagger . <sssss> in the metro valley it 's just nice to know that there is a good chance you will be able to see that foreign film you have been waiting for , or catch some of indie films . <sssss> there are 5 theaters , and i just saw a film in theater # 5 , it may be held 70 people , not sure , but even with it looking small , i did n't feel like i was squished . <sssss> the entire theater is clean , the refreshment stand is their right when you walk in , staff is friendly , just a good vibe over all ! <sssss> look forward to watching many more movies there ! 
4		yum ! <sssss> the ambiance in this place is a bit weird - it feels like a 1960 's thai diner - but the food and service are both fantastic . <sssss> i tried out the thai hut fried rice and my husband had the drunken noodles . <sssss> both were delish . <sssss> i ca n't wait to eat the leftovers . <sssss> it 's nice to have another place within walking distance , too . <sssss> one thing to note - their ` medium ' level was more like mild-medium . <sssss> not very spicy , at least on the fried rice . 
4		the house was packed last night . <sssss> there was a wait list so i told mat put me down for two . <sssss> i gave him my first name and last initial , because this tells mat we are yelpers and that is a good thing . <sssss> we head on over to the bar which was packed and in a moment i was acknowledged and ordered two beers off the black board live alerts . <sssss> i also asked if there was a cask tonight , `` next week '' the sweet gal replied . <sssss> beer number one : könig ludwig weiss draft poured into a clean shaker glass , this beer is an easy-drinking , satisfying wheat beer with emphasis on predominantly hefeweiss yeast . <sssss> the flavors are heavy and saturating on the palate , but clean and refreshing . <sssss> an 84 point beer $ 6 . <sssss> beer number two : green flash trippel poured into a large brandy snifter , hazy orange gold with a tall white head . <sssss> the beer smells of apples , pears , spices , and malt backbone . <sssss> the taste is that of a classic trippel . <sssss> the hops do add some nice balance throughout the beer and the alcohol is well-hidden in the flavor . <sssss> 83 points $ 7 . <sssss> we walk on to the patio and have a seat while we are waiting for a table to dine . <sssss> outside is very comfortable with views the downtown sky scrapers . <sssss> there is a quarter moon in conjunction with the westward ho tower . <sssss> it 's pretty nice . <sssss> mat comes and finds us happy and chatting away . <sssss> we walk in and are seated on a two top . <sssss> i begin asking my neighbors what are you eating . <sssss> they were super friendly guys and began to show me their food . <sssss> drum sticks called smokin legs $ 9 that looked great and a near finished burger $ 9 . <sssss> most interesting looking item on the menu was the bison blt in a blanket . <sssss> $ 8.5 . <sssss> a bison hotdog topped with bacon , seasonal greens , tomato and house made mayo . <sssss> my gal got herself a churchhill grilled cheese $ 8.5 smoked mozzarella and fontina cheese , honey drizzle , seasonal greens and pesto . <sssss> side of fries . <sssss> i ordered more beer . <sssss> the house is in need of acoustics . <sssss> the party was loud but super fun . 
4		loved this place , the menu really has something for everyone ! <sssss> i went with my family -lrb- who are all meat eaters -rrb- and they ordered a rustica pizza , penne with meat balls , a calzone , and salad and they loved it all . <sssss> i had my own gluten-free , vegan version of the provence pizza and it was truly delicious ! <sssss> we all loved our meal . <sssss> the atmosphere is pretty casual , and all of the staff was very friendly and accomodating . <sssss> loved ! 
4		update oct. 2013 : i went there again this weekend and it was just like the good old days . <sssss> the service was great and the food was absolutely the best food i have ever eaten there . <sssss> i got the nachos with chicken and beef and the flavors of both are amongst some of the best flavored meats i have had anywhere . <sssss> they have also remodeled in the past few months and it looks really great . <sssss> they added new booths that look nice and are comfortable . <sssss> this used to be my favorite mexican restaurant . <sssss> however , over the last few years it has really been a disappointment . <sssss> my most recent visit a week ago was horrible . <sssss> they got both orders at my table wrong . <sssss> i sent mine back and it came back wrong a second time . <sssss> i was so annoyed i ended up just picking it apart and eating the chicken . <sssss> my friends just ate hers the way it came . <sssss> the server offered no apology and i just could n't wait to pay the check and leave . 
4		i recently stayed at the wyndham the night before and the night of my wedding . <sssss> it was also the location that my out of town wedding guests stayed at . <sssss> first of all , it is a great location . <sssss> there are so many great restaurants nearby and it is close to the light rail and the new cityscape in downtown phoenix . <sssss> the staff there was amazing , especially the catering/weddings coordinator . <sssss> they want above and beyond what i asked of them . <sssss> they gave me a great deal on my book of rooms and the rooms are remodeled beatifully . <sssss> the parking is a little expensive , but it is valet , and for overnight parking in downtown phoenix it is the same everywhere . <sssss> the only bummer was that the starbucks in the lobby is not open on sundays ! 
4		i 'm not really sure if this is the right rolberto 's that we ate at but it was really really good so if they are a chain and all related you really ca n't go wrong . <sssss> it was funny because i really like a place called roberto 's and one of our friends we were with was a local and she said oh we have roberto 's here and i was sold right then and there , and then when we pulled up i said `` hey this is n't roberto 's it 's rolberto 's '' this was entirely too funny to us and i hope you can appreciate the humor . <sssss> the story aside the food delivered and we enjoyed it ! 
4		we all know that these things are incredible i mean , it 's no secret ! <sssss> these cupcakes are made by angels in the clouds . <sssss> they are moist and full of flavor . <sssss> i love the dark chocolate and the red velvet . <sssss> the only thing i surprisingly do n't care for are the hard candies on top . <sssss> the first/last time i bit into one i thought i broke a tooth , it was like plastic . <sssss> i actually thought it was plastic until my friend chomped one away . <sssss> this location is teeny with very little parking next to the building . <sssss> however , it 's right across from the mall and it 's actually pretty convenient . <sssss> it always looks like it 's packed by the extremely long lines out the door , but they move very quickly so the line goes fast . <sssss> the girls working are always very friendly and great at suggesting new flavors . <sssss> i called recently to get 12 pack for a friends birthday and they had them done within less than an hour , packed up and ready to go . <sssss> i also got a puppy cupcake which her dog seemed to really enjoy . <sssss> ;-rrb- the birthday packs are n't too bad about $ 45 with the puppy cupcake . <sssss> they were a huge hit and no one was disappointed . <sssss> :-rrb- this place is delicious and i love sweets . <sssss> i will be back , like the terminator . 
4		compared to most restaurants in kierland commons , brio tuscan grille continues to offer a good value and a nice time for happy hour ! <sssss> the other restaurant that is good for hh is tommy bahama 's . <sssss> we come here probably once a week or so before a movie and the happy hour is great ! <sssss> wine is reasonably priced around $ 10.00 while all the appetizers are $ 2.95 . <sssss> carpaccio , ravioli caprese , flat bread sausage and peperoni and sirloin sliders , et cetera all for $ 2.95 ! <sssss> nice ! <sssss> brio recently began offering $ 5.00 martini 's on wednesdays . <sssss> the only problem with the brio is the bar area has limited seating . <sssss> what they really need to do is give some thought to expansion because the outdoor seating just does n't always work well . <sssss> so get their early ! <sssss> our most recent tab came to $ 35.63 before tip . <sssss> good food , good drinks , good value ! <sssss> enjoy ! 
4		had to hit freddy 's after my disappointment with culver 's love this place ! <sssss> great steak burgers and custard ! 
4		the lunch specials are awesome . <sssss> you get plenty of food for a very small amount of scratch . <sssss> however ... chicago style , it is not . <sssss> not even close . <sssss> regardless , it 's a good little place if you 're on a budget and cravin some pizza . 
4		my wife and i have eaten a few time here now , and st francis has consistently served incredibly delicious food every time . <sssss> the green chile stew is the best green chile i have ever had . <sssss> this is one of the few restaurants i have found that seems to prepare their less expensive dishes with as much craft and precision as their more expensive plates . <sssss> the polenta is so rich and creamy it eats like a meal by itself . <sssss> the pork chop was perfectly cooked and seasoned about as well as any piece of meat i have ever had . <sssss> my wife wo n't stop talking about how much she liked the forbidden rice we had last night.the waitstaff is friendly and the atmosphere is comfortably refined . 
4		i like this home depot . <sssss> there 's a few great things about it . <sssss> 1 . <sssss> it 's next to my house 2 . <sssss> it 's never that busy 3 . <sssss> people there are usually pretty knowledgeable -lrb- when you can find someone in the department -rrb- i had an especially good experience there last night . <sssss> i had called to check the price on a vacuum that i had seen online that was marked down . <sssss> i called to double check price and they transferred me to the flooring department . <sssss> the associate repeated back to me the item and quoted me the wrong price . <sssss> i chalked it up to online vs. store pricing . <sssss> but , my inquisitiveness got the best of me and i headed in . <sssss> i double checked the price in person . <sssss> i was right ! <sssss> the item had been marked down and the associate had n't actually checked in the system . <sssss> long story short , i had to buy the item `` online '' and pickup in store to get the price i wanted and it was just about closing time . <sssss> the manager mark walked me throug the process and helped me out a ton by ensuring i got what i needed while i was there and even kept the store open for a few extra minutes for me . <sssss> gold stars for mark . 
4		i came here for the first time last night with a girlfriend for appetizers , and was really pleased with my experience . <sssss> unforunately , we missed happy hour by only a few minutes , but we had a blast anyways ! <sssss> for starters , i really loved the decor of the place . <sssss> red chairs , tables of all sizes , with such a great atmosphere . <sssss> there 's room to spread out some , so its not like your sitting on top of one another . <sssss> menu selection and prices were great , and the place was jam packed ! <sssss> my friend and i went with the shrimp appetizer and split it . <sssss> order came out quickly , and the dish was so cute looking ! <sssss> served with crackers , some sauce and some other stuff , we dug in immediately . <sssss> the shrimp was spicy ! <sssss> but in a good way ... we both were surprised , but whatever it was marinated in had a nice kick to it . <sssss> overall , i had a really great experience here . <sssss> so you ask , why not 5 stars ? <sssss> well , here 's why . <sssss> first , parking here can be a bit tight . <sssss> the later you go , the more difficult it will be to get parking . <sssss> this is a very popular part of town , with lots of other locations around 5th and wine to hang out at . <sssss> there is a parking structure , but plan on doing a little walking in case you go for a late dinner . <sssss> -lrb- really its not that bad , but if your in heels or the weather is poor , come prepared ! -rrb- <sssss> secondly , the happy hour ended at 6 . <sssss> um , most people work and ca n't get there that early ! <sssss> my schedule allows me to get their earlier , but would be nice if they extended it until 7 , especially on a friday . <sssss> thirdly , our server was fine , but overall she did n't seem to take much interest in spending time at our table . <sssss> she would literally continue walking and ask if everything was okay without hardly stopping . <sssss> yes , i know its a busy friday night , but she seemed like she just was n't interested . <sssss> anyways , place is great , i love it here , and i will probably be back for more in the future ! 
4		i am all about my food being flavorful and plentiful , this place did not disappoint ! <sssss> every single bite was flavor party in my mouth . <sssss> jamaican , chinese and mexican food fused together with just the right amount of spice , how amazing ! <sssss> if you are in within a 30 minute drive this place is a must ! 
4		smashburger is pretty good overall . <sssss> better than five guys , although i wish it were a little closer to where i live ! <sssss> i 've been twice - once to this location and once to another , both times with my husband . <sssss> the first time , we got fries , he got the bacon cheeseburger -lrb- which he raved about and i tried a bite to confirm that it is in fact delicious -rrb- . <sssss> i got the black bean burger , and it was a little spicy for my wimpy tastes . <sssss> it does say spicy in the name i guess ... the second time , i got chicken with cucumber and goat cheese . <sssss> i liked it , but my husband loved it . <sssss> he got a bacon ranch avocado burger , which was yummy but super greasy and the avocado was n't ripe enough . <sssss> but the amazing oreo milkshake more than made up for it . <sssss> it cost around $ 18-19 for two sandwiches and the milkshake -lrb- no fries or other drinks -rrb- . <sssss> every employee i 've interacted with at smashburger has been friendly , polite , professional , just good people overall . <sssss> i do n't eat meat often , but if i 'm craving a burger , this is a good place to go . 
4		good burrito w fresh ingredients . <sssss> nice and spicy , good service ! 
4		super awesome sushi . <sssss> get the cucumber rolls , they 're the bomb ! <sssss> also the rice wrap sushi is amazing . <sssss> great service & fabulous food . <sssss> the only reason they 're not getting 5 stars is their bathroom was nasty , no toilet paper , just a kleenex box . 
4		it has been a while since i have eaten at blue nile . <sssss> maybe a year or two . <sssss> i remembered thinking that this place was not very good flavor wise compared to cafe lalibela so i have been going there instead . <sssss> however , i had a coupon and was craving ethiopian food , so my husband and i thought to give this place another try . <sssss> so glad we did . <sssss> i 'm not sure if there is a new cook in the kitchen , if it is under different management , or if my memory just is n't that great , but things seemed a bit different from what i had remembered . <sssss> . <sssss> and definitely for the better . <sssss> for example , they now seem to have a raw food menu , which i do n't recall them having back in the days and their regular menu seems more extensive than before , allbeit a little confusing sometimes . <sssss> for example , the non-vegan entrees come with your choice of two veggie sides -lrb- from the vegan menu -rrb- but that is not stated on the menu . <sssss> nor is it stated on the menu that the veggie sides one chooses from for their meals are listed under vegan entrees since these `` sides '' may also be served as entrees . <sssss> it makes sense , but all this is not readily apparent when you just look at the menu . <sssss> the food was excellent . <sssss> my husband and i both got the blue nile messob , which is a combination plate that includes a half portion each of beef tebbs and chicken doro wat , and three full portions of any veggie side . <sssss> my husband had the tikil gomen -lrb- cabbage and potatoes -rrb- , a lentil side i ca n't recall the name of , and one other side which i also forgot . <sssss> -lrb- i was too engrossed in my meal to pay attention to his -rrb- . <sssss> lol . <sssss> i had the gomen wat -lrb- collard greens -rrb- , begerden -lrb- eggplant -rrb- , and duba -lrb- yellow squash -rrb- . <sssss> each side was not only full of flavor , but also had their own distinct taste and texture . <sssss> my husband commented on how he preferred blue nile to lalibella , because at lalibella a comparable dish would have sides that kind of run together in flavor and texture . <sssss> i think i would agree with him to a certain extent . <sssss> not necessarily in flavor , but definitely in texture . <sssss> the veggies and such at lalibella are , i believe , put through a food processor and so the natural texture of each veggie is lost . <sssss> but at blue nile , the veggies are instead chopped into small pieces . <sssss> a small difference , but it does change the experience of the food . <sssss> with the coupon -lrb- 20 % off -rrb- we spent about $ 26 including 2 non-alcoholic drinks and a 20 + % tip . <sssss> i ca n't say whether or not blue nile is better than lalibella . <sssss> they both seem to have their pros and cons , which do n't necessarily have to do with the food 's flavor , but more so personal preferences on texture , price -lrb- blue nile is a bit pricier than lalibella -rrb- , and types of offerings -lrb- blue nile seems to have a more extensive menu than lalibella -rrb- . <sssss> open 7 days a week from 11 am - 10 pm . <sssss> lunch specials on week days from 11 am - 3 pm . <sssss> sundays and mondays they serve raw and organic food , as well as their regular menu . 
4		this used to be one of my favorite quick lunch spots in the northwest valley . <sssss> the portions are huge , the prices are totally affordable , the staff is always friendly , and if you order one of the wraps , they fire/cook the bread right there in front of your eyes ! <sssss> and it 's delicious by the way ! <sssss> definitely try one of the wraps if you stop in but beware ... you might need a wheelbarrow to cart yourself out ! 
4		i went there for the first time today and got an iced honey-vanilla latte and i was impressed . <sssss> i 'm not a fan of espresso drinks that are too sweet so i was hesitant , but this was great . <sssss> just sweet enough , but i could still taste the espresso . <sssss> i also got a cranberry orange scone and i will definitely be going back for more of those ! <sssss> it was packed with cranberries and was just overall tasty . 
4		i met my friend and her mom here tonight for dinner . <sssss> we got here pretty early which was great because by the time we left , it was standing room early . <sssss> got ta love those early dinners :-rrb- we were seated in the bar area and were promptly asked our drink order . <sssss> when our first waiter arrived , he seemed friendly at first but when i asked him if the flirtini drink was any good , he proceeded to say '' if it was n't good it would n't be on the menu '' we were like , that is not necessarily true but hmm ok . <sssss> -lrb- needless to say it was good though -rrb- i ordered the plate of sliders which came with miniatures of the wcg cheeseburger , bbq bacon burger and maytag burger and french fries . <sssss> i asked that my fries be made without salt because lately i have noticed that fries seem to be caked with salt . <sssss> needless to say that when my fries arrived they were covered in salt . <sssss> ewwww ... i looked around and out of nowhere , our new waitress tiffany -lrb- who was also manning the bar -rrb- came over and asked if everything was ok . <sssss> i told her that i had asked for fries with no salt and she said lets just leave these here and i will get some fresh ones out to you . <sssss> about 5 mins later this huge plate of piping hot no salt added fries arrived and needless to say i devoured all of them . <sssss> yes i know greedy but they were so good . <sssss> oh and the miniature burgers were yummy as well but ended up bringing home a mini because i was stuffed from all the fries . <sssss> my friend and her mom ordered the rotisserie chicken rotisserie chicken crêpes which were filled with rotisserie chicken , spinach and a mushroom cream sauce and topped with madeira sauce and parmesan cheese . <sssss> they both said that it was really good . <sssss> we also ordered the az egg rolls which were traditional egg rolls filled with spicy grilled chicken , corn , black beans and jack cheeses . <sssss> they had a salsa dip and a jalapeno dip and they were quite yummy . <sssss> now for dessert , my friend and her mom ordered white chocolate brownie to share . <sssss> it had french vanilla ice cream , a warm white chocolate brownie , chocolate sauce and whipped cream with white chocolate shavings . <sssss> i am not a fan of white chocolate but they both seemed to enjoy it . <sssss> so my experience at wcg was all in all a good one . <sssss> i was with my fabulous friend and her adorable mom , plus tiffany went above and beyond for us by just making sure we were ok . <sssss> hats off to you girl ! 
4		i 'm not a country fan by any stretch of the imagination , however during the week this is a really fun bar . <sssss> i would avoid the long lines on the weekends fyi . <sssss> i also heard the grub here is pretty darned good . 
4		i wish we had a closer valle luna to our home , but this one is worth the drive . <sssss> i bought a gift certificate from restaurant.com and took my 3 kids to this restaurant for a night out with mommy . <sssss> i had n't been there in years . <sssss> the waiter was prompt at keeping my massive amounts of iced tea flowing , and was very nice . <sssss> i ordered the pollo fundido and it was fabulous . <sssss> whatever seasoning they use on the chicken was so tasty . <sssss> it was probably the best pollo fundido i 've ever had . <sssss> chips and salsa and my kids ' food was great as well . <sssss> i 've been eating here for over 10 yrs , and i never really enjoyed it all that much until this experience . <sssss> i will definitely be back with another gift certificate : -rrb- 
4		urban beans is a cool spot ya 'll . <sssss> the interior is simple and pleasant . <sssss> the windows allow a lot of light to come in to make a nice bright atmosphere . <sssss> the walls have cool art and chalk drawings . <sssss> the drinks are good and reasonably priced . <sssss> try the scones and biscotti . <sssss> they are excellent . <sssss> urban beans has wifi and an outside patio area . <sssss> the baristas are friendly and hip . <sssss> i have been there on an open musician night and it was a nice surprise . <sssss> urban beans seems to be doing everything right . <sssss> what a great addition to central phoenix . 
4		get there right before closing time and there was a line , staff was friendly and i was allowed to taste different unusual flavors like `` blue cheese '' and `` jalapeno avocado '' but stayed with a save one belgium chocolate that was amazing and the sugar cone waffle was the freshest . 
4		i 've eaten at bink 's in scottsdale three times since it opened , and the food is delicious . <sssss> the taste is in the details . <sssss> i could tell that everything was made from scratch including sauces , dips , and all of the bread . <sssss> the butter that comes with the buckwheat biscuits alone makes me want to return . <sssss> they have a killer happy hour , too . <sssss> get the sweetbread nuggets and mussels . 
4		stopped by the tasting room last night with a group of nine and had a great experience . <sssss> while i do love four peaks on 8th , it can sometimes be so crowded with college folks that it becomes annoying , and if last night was any indicator of the general crowd of the tasting room , i 'll be trekking over here fairly regularly . <sssss> they only serve beer and wine , all of four peaks ' brews plus a guest tap or two and whatever concoction four peaks is currently working on , so you need to know that you like their stuff , plus no food , so bring your own . <sssss> but in terms of it being a relaxed atmosphere to put down a few and enjoy company in peace , it 's the place to be . <sssss> you 'll find me here from time to time playing elder sign or some other nerdy game for sure . 
4		i know this is a chain and found that there is one in sf . <sssss> we ended up coming here for a late lunch after picking up the husband and daughter from the airport when they flew into phoenix to celebrate my gram 's 90th . <sssss> my mom had yet to come here and the fact that this used to be houston 's which used to be located across the street which well , everything that once was has changed in phoenix . <sssss> my mom ordered the artichoke and claimed it was one of the best she ever had . <sssss> i had one of the best house side salads ever . <sssss> it had all sorts of goodies from beets to goat cheese to hidden gems of avocado . <sssss> perfect . <sssss> the husband had a french dip he said he would fly back to have again and the dd ordered seared ahi -lrb- she is much more adventurous than i -rrb- and loved it . <sssss> service was friendly , we left full and i look forward to another experience with hillstone . 
4		- small and cute antique shop with many `` true '' antiques and vintage treasures -lrb- not like how many of them are adding boutique crap -rrb- . <sssss> - looks like a little emporium or old style general store . <sssss> - a cute candy section . <sssss> - upstairs is well-worth the visit . <sssss> - decent prices . <sssss> - right across the street from the vt library . 
4		i love going to this trader joes , i 'm always welcomed by the staff , and feel comfortable asking for help if i ca n't find something . <sssss> since it 's one of the newest locations in arizona , the store is clean and open , and there is always plenty of staff in store to help if you need it . <sssss> as other locations trader joes has a good selection of organic food items for really good prices . <sssss> i come to this location whenever i 'm in the area . 
4		ok , what i did leave out is the soft drinks have been cut in the amount of the flavoring that is added . <sssss> the drinks are very cut down and you are just able to tell the flavor of the drink . 
4		just like everyone else i like joe 's farm grill , not sure if i love it yet . <sssss> we stopped in for breakfast and i ordered the joe 's big breakfast consisting of eggs , sausage , bacon and 2 pancakes for $ 9.99 was good my eggs were not soft scrambled as i ordered them . <sssss> but the delicious pancakes made up for that issue . <sssss> my husband had the chicken & mushroom scramble made of grilled chicken breast , fresh mushrooms , caramelized onions , fontina and cream cheese w / skillet potatoes . <sssss> he was very impressed with his meal but wished for more that 1 strip of flatbread . <sssss> we do n't live near gilbert but we will be back to eat at joe 's farm grill for lunch in the future so that i can change my like to love because it takes time to build a relationship . 
4		if you need to go out with a group and everyone is picky , grand lux is the type of place to go . <sssss> much like cheesecake factory -lrb- same company and in fact they have a few cf desserts on their menu -rrb- , the place is pretty big and structured like a cf would be . <sssss> the menu is large in options to choose from to appease really any taste . <sssss> great/large salads , asian , american , seafood , etc. . <sssss> you name it . <sssss> i had the indochine chicken/shrimp -lrb- i like the bang bang c/s at cf too -rrb- and was not disappointed . <sssss> portion was great -lrb- wife and i shared -rrb- and the food was tasty . <sssss> we had beignets for dessert which were warm and delicious . <sssss> great service , good menu options for groups . <sssss> only complaint is that it felt a little pricey when we walked away with a shared dinner . <sssss> i 'm not in scottsdale that much , but a great place to go with friends to just chat and enjoy some good food to please everyone . 
4		best fried chicken . <sssss> new coupons with great deal every week . <sssss> i used to eat it every week . <sssss> the chicken is so juicy and tender . <sssss> i wish they could have more different flavors . 
4		if you like brown , this is the place to hike . <sssss> did the gateway loop . <sssss> counter clockwise . <sssss> the first mile felt like it took forever . <sssss> and i questioned only having one bottle of water for me and the wife . <sssss> i was starting to think about sucking cactus juice . <sssss> but once we got to the gateway saddle it was smooth sailing , cooler , greener , and less arid . <sssss> a good 3.6 mile hike that will take about 3 hours if you walk it at a decent clip . 
4		very laid back and great place . <sssss> outdoor patio is awesome and in the nice weather a great place to people watch . <sssss> for a small bar , their food is amazing . <sssss> definitely stop by for happy hour ! 
4		good quick clean meal in downtown phoenix served by staff who actually care that you have a good meal , all for 7.25 with good fries and a drink . <sssss> what else do you want in downtown ? 
4		this place is very simple , take-out only , three kinds of regular sandwiches with another special market sandwich , several kinds of salads , a few types of italian soda or alike , that 's all ! <sssss> it 's that simple and quick , yet always packed . <sssss> my favorite is the mozzarella , tomato and basil sandwich . <sssss> freshly baked bread from the on-site brick oven with the home made mozzarella , fresh local tomato and basil , it 's that simple and delicious !!! <sssss> trust me , $ 8 for a big and high-quality sandwich , you 'll be very satisfied ! <sssss> only drawback is that it only opens for lunch , 11am-3pm , and only tuesday - saturday . <sssss> maybe that 's why people keep going back ! 
4		i 'm not a huge fan of breakfast food . <sssss> but i got breakfast here just for you ~ ~ :p so i can see why a lot of reviewers said to go for the home fries . <sssss> the hash browns looked fine , perfectly golden on the top , exactly the way i prefer it . <sssss> however , i 'm pretty sure there were n't the additional flavorings like the rosemary and onions in that ~ ! <sssss> the home fries had great flavor and they cooked crispy on at least one of the sides of each piece . <sssss> absolutely one of the best breakfast potatoes i 've ever had . <sssss> i got the special of the day which was 3 eggs scrambled with ham off the bone , anaheim chili peppers , and cheese with a side of tortilla . <sssss> it was delicious . <sssss> good char on the tortilla too . <sssss> it was very slightly underdone , but i actually prefer that over the risk of overdone eggs . <sssss> i guess the one thing that detracted from the place was the limited menu . <sssss> they do n't really serve any alcoholic beverages -lrb- which is actually a bit refreshing -rrb- , and some common breakfast items are not on the menu -lrb- ie biscuits and gravy , french toast -rrb- . <sssss> but hey , if i can pick anything off their menu and it will be equally delicious , i would always come back ! 
4		i 've driven by this place a hundred times but did n't notice until i was on the hunt for breakfast one weekday morning . <sssss> and indeed , it turned out to be a delicious secret . <sssss> the restaurant is small , similar to matt 's big breakfast . <sssss> it is n't warm with lots of windows , but is more modern in design with sleek tables and a simple serving area . <sssss> the food is pricier , but well worth the personal attention each food item receives . <sssss> i enjoyed a chocolate milk -lrb- no such thing as fat free here -rrb- and their very simple french toast -lrb- with real maple syrup -rrb- . <sssss> my companion had a regular coffee that he said was better than most phoenix area coffee shops . <sssss> i went on a wednesday morning at 8am and we were two of four people there . <sssss> i could see how it would be very crowded during the weekend , but for a quick bit before work , no place is better . 
4		i was a little hesitant to visit this establishment after reading the many reviews on yelp . <sssss> after deciding to take a chance on the breadfruit , i am left pleasantly surprised . <sssss> we had made reservations prior to dining and i would recommend that to everyone ; it is not that big of a restaurant and fills up quickly . <sssss> we started out with plantain/avocado baked spring rolls and some jerk prawns . <sssss> both dishes were fantastic . <sssss> the jerk seasoning had an appropriate level of spiciness and the baked plantain rolls were creamy and sweet with the mango chutney that comes with it . <sssss> for dinner we had the pimiento-smoked mussels and the jerk chicken . <sssss> both dishes were awesome . <sssss> you could taste the smoky flavor in the broth of the mussels and the jerk chicken was fantatstic . <sssss> for drinks , we both started out with their dark n stormy rum/ginger beer concoction . <sssss> expensive , but worth it . <sssss> also had a couple red stripes , which , at $ 4 each is a bargain . <sssss> the waiter was a little pushy with the suggestions and specials , but , he is partly a salesman , and was doing his job . <sssss> i will go back to the breadfruit , as i am a huge fan of rum , and they have a whole other side of the restaurant dedicated to that fine sugar cane juice . 
4		a great place to go if you need almost anything while staying at the lake . <sssss> the guys that help with the gas are amazing . 
4		i have been to this place twice now , the 1st time was a 1st date that led to my marriage . <sssss> this is a great 1st date location . <sssss> they have designed the moderate space well , with 2 levels and plenty of booths . <sssss> thier lighting and interior decorating adds to a feeling of cozy and secluded . <sssss> hats off to the chef ! <sssss> they do a great job with fish , and wonderful grilled veggies and aromatic sides . <sssss> the service was not excellent , but good . <sssss> seemed that he floor might not have been staffed well my 2nd visit . 
4		went there for happy hour with a friend recenty had two beers , their version of egg rolls -lrb- or spring rolls or whatever you want to call them -rrb- chicken wings , and `` soi '' sliders -lrb- ground pork with awesome buns -rrb- between the two of us . <sssss> the bill was $ 25 total , awesome value and everything tasted great . 
4		if we 'd have seen this place just driving down the road , we never would have stopped because from the outside it does n't look like much . <sssss> but because i had read so many great reviews we decided to give it a try , and i 'm so glad we did ! <sssss> we 've now eaten there at least 5 times ... each and every time was amazing . <sssss> the staff is great ! <sssss> the food is absolutely incredible ! <sssss> beautifully presented and perfectly prepared . <sssss> the entire staff works very hard to make sure you have a great dining experience . <sssss> i have not stopped recommending this place to people since i first ate there , and i 'm looking forward to our next visit ! 
4		i 'm not sure why the grind is getting such bad reviews . <sssss> i think this is one of the best places to get a burger in north scottsdale . <sssss> service : excellent food : favorite is the mushroom burger ! <sssss> sweet and spicy is also super good , tends to be spicier than sweeter though . <sssss> you can get any burger protein style which is a healthier alternative , but if you 're going to eat a burger , i say eat the whole dang thing . <sssss> i 'm a small girl and i can eat a whole burger easily , so i do n't recommend sharing . <sssss> salads i 've had the asparagus , which is yummy but if you dont ' t like goat cheese i do n't recommend it . <sssss> even though the salads are under starters you could eat one as your main meal . <sssss> onion rings and herb fries are my fave sides ! <sssss> for dessert you must try the warm donuts ... the best in town ! <sssss> drinks : my husbands drink of choice is the moscow mule . <sssss> i 've had the girly cocktails and was n't impressed . <sssss> i would stick to the wines . <sssss> price : burger average $ 11 , sides $ 5 , and drinks around $ 10 . 
4		i have been here many times but recently decided to try the eggs benedict . <sssss> they are not my favorite . <sssss> the howie burger is perhaps one of my favorites ! <sssss> their fries are well seasoned leaving ketchup as only an option . <sssss> i have enjoyed the nachos and other items on the menu . <sssss> i even like the key lime pie although i am generally not a fan . <sssss> the red velvet cake is the best of any place ever ! <sssss> my fiance ordered this for my birthday a couple of years ago and it was decorated with fresh blueberries and strawberries . <sssss> perfection ! 
4		a highly recommended restaurant from separate concierges at the hilton pointe squaw peak resort . <sssss> to their reco 's , the sierra bonita did not disappoint . <sssss> i really enjoyed the bacon covered shrimp and i loved the buttermilk chicken with asparagus . <sssss> i was pleasantly surprised when our waitress brought a complimentary 's ` mores ' dessert for my colleague who was celebrating his birthday that night . <sssss> our waitress was ultra-sweet and fun ; despite telling us we were welcome to stay as late as she wanted , we could tell when the chairs were on the tables and the lights were being turned off that our time there was coming to an end . 
4		`` great , unique food . <sssss> excellent happy hour prices ! <sssss> the staff is so friendly and entertaining . <sssss> we will be back !! '' 
4		the only reason i am not giving 5 stars , is cause it is a wee bit pricey . <sssss> but oh , so worth it ! <sssss> one of the best guinness pours in town . <sssss> great atmosphere , misters on their back patio . <sssss> i always get the shepard 's pie - out of this world . <sssss> my wife loves the veggie version of the shepard 's pie and the salad with salmon . <sssss> you got ta try a side of the brussel sprouts with apples . <sssss> yum . <sssss> like any place on mill ave , it get crowded th-sa during the school year . <sssss> and can get noisy . 
4		wonderful place for a delicious dinner . 
4		enjoyed our meal but when you have two italian heavyweights in the neighborhood , noca and trattoria bianco , you ca n't help but think that this place comes off as sort of corporate and inauthentic in comparison . 
4		love this new place ! <sssss> they have only been open a little over a week and are still working out some kinks . <sssss> the server notified us that they have not even had their grand opening yet but they are off to a great start . <sssss> love the menu options , not your typical greasy bar food . <sssss> i had the open road flatbread , the dough and sauce were amazing . <sssss> my husband had the bison burger which was juicy and delicious . <sssss> we will try them again for sure and im sure they will just keep getting better and better but it looks like they are working hard and listening to everyones comments . 
4		may not be `` authentic '' vietnamese , but that does n't mean it 's not terrific . <sssss> went back today and had the tealight special - a good size bowl of chicken pho , a spring roll -lrb- shrimp , noodles and veggies in a rice wrapper -rrb- and two small pork & veggie eggrolls . <sssss> dipping sauces add just the right balance of sweet , sour and salty . <sssss> the fresh basil is the perfect addition to the pho -- love to rip it up and add it all into the bowl . <sssss> so fragrant . <sssss> good , good stuff . <sssss> a big , tasty change-of-pace lunch for about $ 9.00 . <sssss> all good . 
4		ca n't go wrong with the gyro salad or the picado gyro !! 
4		this place is great !! <sssss> the food is reasonably priced and delicious . <sssss> the service is fast too , which makes it a great place for a quick lunch break . <sssss> so far i 've not been disappointed by anything on the menu ! 
4		this place is great ! <sssss> it was my first time in years and they were so nice and retaught me everything . <sssss> they were very patient , and it is half off for your first time ! <sssss> such a fun , great workout . <sssss> 2 complaints -lrb- that were not too big of a deal -rrb- 1 . <sssss> very crowded ... went on a tuesday night and had to wait for some of the walls 2 . <sssss> walked by one of the rooms and it smelled like weed . <sssss> . <sssss> not that i have a problem with that ... its just not what i want to smell when i 'm working out 
4		thanks to groupon , we found the gem in our neighborhood . <sssss> the dining room is small , so when it 's busy , tables are tough to find . <sssss> there are only a few chairs next to the hostess stand and it can get really crowded there during peak hours . <sssss> we 've ordered the following menu items : gnocchi w/gorgonzola cream sauce , $ 10.95 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nicks-scottsdale?select=t5quiiz0rxafykagpoc7qq#t5quiiz0rxafykagpoc7qq 10 '' sausage & pepperoni pizza w/gorgonzola cheese , $ 9.45 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nicks-scottsdale?select=viki17uy1fsyvsrfnzisqw#viki17uy1fsyvsrfnzisqw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nicks-scottsdale?select=u4odmyuyxb7jsympbbiyaw#u4odmyuyxb7jsympbbiyaw baked ziti , $ 9.95 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nicks-scottsdale?select=hhblkid7bubio48cia_3xg#hhblkid7bubio48cia_3xg the gnocchi & baked ziti is delish . <sssss> they cook the gnocchi just the way i like it , al dente . <sssss> the better half enjoys her baked ziti with gorgonzola cream sauce and they oblige her with that special order . <sssss> the pizza is very very good . <sssss> i love pizza and they do a great job here . <sssss> the service here is good , i would n't say excellent . <sssss> return factor - 90 % 
4		the food is not too bad ... i went there for lunch and all i wanted to do was try some of thier mojitos ... but since i was going back to work it was not a real option ... but i would defintaly like to go back for some dirnks and try some of thier food ... everythign on thier menu was different ... i really liked the menu and the things that i tried from the people i was dining with were pretty good ... 
4		in honor of how fast they make their sandwiches , i will be brief . <sssss> if we are to be honest it 's a regular college/senior place to work -lrb- socialize -rrb- , no one looks lik they are allowed to set foot in a bar . <sssss> yet , do not forsake our new and young minds , they may not know how to comb their hair but their metabolic rate is at peak form and they are using it . <sssss> my expectations for this place are : fast , tasty and cheap food . <sssss> they do it , and they repeat it when asked . <sssss> thank you ! <sssss> rl 
4		chiropractor 's office attached to the gold 's gym at 83rd and thunderbird . <sssss> we went here after a subpar experience somewhere else , and were definitely impressed . <sssss> dr stamp works m/w/f and always has a few minutes to chat or offer advice between seeing patients or while doing paperwork . <sssss> he was the first chiro i 've been to who actually asked me where i hurt then did adjustments specifically to fix that . <sssss> i had ribs out of whack and a few other things and he put them all back . <sssss> and he was comfortable working on my above-average sized husband , which some chiropractors are n't . <sssss> i would have liked to be shown more stretches and such to do so i wo n't be back as often . <sssss> they are great at working with your insurance and finances - they have a deal where for $ 199 you can go as many times as you want in a month . <sssss> you do have to sign up for 2 months back to back , but it is still a good deal . <sssss> only downfall here is that their cash rate is higher if you do n't have insurance . <sssss> it is $ 50 cash for an adjustment , but only $ 35 if you have insurance . <sssss> that 's true whether or not you even opt to have them bill your insurance . <sssss> i think they take walk-ins , but if nothing else we have been able to call and get same-day appointments pretty consistently . 
4		i ordered from # 1 brother 's to try it again . <sssss> they are back on their game . <sssss> the pizza was hot , cheese was melty , and it is just plain good . <sssss> so happy the last time was just an one off mistake . <sssss> thank goodness . <sssss> my husband was about to ban us from this place . <sssss> love the think pizza and crust . 
4		yum ! <sssss> night staff is the best ! <sssss> they are funny and always actually awake and attentive ! <sssss> i love this place and will always eat here . 
4		not bad at all . <sssss> the staff is always very nice and quick . <sssss> the sandwiches are alright , usually just a little soggy since they are not made right on the spot . <sssss> the cupcakes are incredible and so is the dill potato salad . <sssss> everything is pretty expensive but its usually worth it . 
4		this is a great place to visit , but i would n't want to shop there ! <sssss> while its an attraction unto itself , and their inventory is incredible , but there are really no bargains or discounts to be had . <sssss> i feel the same way about r.e.i. if you are looking for camping gear - they have the stuff , but you can find it for considerably less on e bay , at walmart , etc. . <sssss> in a nutshell , its a fun place to visit , and you 'll find a variety of items that you may be looking for , but you 're gon na ' pay full retail price and you should expect no discount . <sssss> besides , how do you think they 're going to pay their air conditioning bill in the summer months ? 
4		in the style of ignatius j. reilly this city is famous for its pablum strip mall culture , its tweaked city-vagrants , antichrist shadeless palms , artificial tans , frauds with transfixed hairstyles , fetishists in stilettos , sodomites , drug addicts , exhibitionists , internet punchers , and litterbugs , all of whom are too reconciled by the lagniappe . <sssss> if you have a moment , i shall endeavor to discuss the portion of this shambles that makes up for the dissident of its surroundings , sky harbor airport which i bothered to scribe into my big chief tablet during my last expedition to fairer country . <sssss> it is rather fine . <sssss> it is not only clean , but impeccable . <sssss> the staff is quite firm on the rules , which i was not made aware that a lute may pass through their customs , but not my british honduran macaw or belizian soy nuts . <sssss> ho hum . <sssss> i had to insert them into the bowel of the plane , which is right where i told the wanded lady to stick her apparatus . <sssss> i wandered up into terminal four , exceedingly the only port worth venturing from , with its hoards of awful fat inducing foods that i would never let my indulgences approach . <sssss> so , i had several plates of chili cheese fries and four bloody marrys at fox sports grill to block my urge from any of the other filth this corporate consortium of overfed americana bestows on its citizens . <sssss> filth ! <sssss> not me . <sssss> no way would i indulge here . <sssss> though terminal four is quite a pleasant atmosphere , and allow myself to reiterate , the best port of exit , there is a severe mass of human activity . <sssss> if you are like myself , you wo n't enjoy the egregious offense against good reading at all of the newstands and boutique book shops around the mall area . <sssss> the `` somebody in arizona loves me '' apparel is without shame entirely ! <sssss> still , if i must leave my beautiful burg in the sun , i enjoy the comforts of this guttersnipe and bawb babble infested airport . <sssss> its just slightly above ho hum . <sssss> but only a just little . 
4		really good neighborhood joint ! <sssss> we 've been ordering here for about 4 years , and its pretty consistent and good . <sssss> prices are ok , not a bargain , but just fair . <sssss> pizza is above average , sandwiches are great -lrb- roast beef -rrb- , wifey love 's their french fries , and the homemade italian dinners -lrb- like lasagna , eggplant parmesian , etc. -rrb- , are really good as well . <sssss> deilvery time is slow on weekends and peak hours . 
4		i love wendy 's very much but the only reason they got 4 stars out of 5 is because sometimes in the evening the window cashier is very rude and even yells at you through the box when you 're ordering your food ... look people i get it you 're working fast food but if you do n't like the job , do n't get the job ... that is all ! 
4		i 've gone to cricket for 3 concerts now , and all 3 were at night in early fall . <sssss> yeah the drinks are expensive , but that is what tailgating is for . <sssss> concrete in the pit seems to deter some crowd surfers , but not all -lrb- not a big fan of getting kicked in the back of the head -rrb- . <sssss> and the schmucks who do crowd surf more often than not get a painful landing when things do n't go as they planned , and laughing at morons is 1 star in and of itself . 
4		i had never eaten gluten free pizza before but loved it here . <sssss> excellent pizza , great family-style salads , attentive service , quick and easy . <sssss> i look forward to my next visit here . 
4		this place is awesome ! <sssss> i walked by it during the tempe arts festival . <sssss> a paleteria on mill ave ?! <sssss> i just had to walk in . <sssss> i chose a nuez paleta because that has always been my favorite flavor . <sssss> my dad hails from michoacan , mx where these paletas originated , so i 've had quite a few in my life . <sssss> it was a little different than what i 'm used to , mainly because the nuts used were much bigger than usual . <sssss> this was n't a bad thing at all though . <sssss> in fact , the paleta was delicious and i would definitely recommend this place . 
4		i found harlow 's cafe one morning in tempe . <sssss> i found the service to be excellent , maybe the best i 've ever had despite the fact that it always seems to be crowded they get people in and out of the restaurant quickly . <sssss> the portions were huge and at affordable prices . <sssss> the food is delicious , huevos rancherous and the cisco plate are both excellent choices . <sssss> the feeling of a mom and pop atmosphere comes to mind . <sssss> the old style booth seating , and canvas paintings on the wall are a nice touch . <sssss> i 've always gotten my food in an extremely quick manner , and at the same time never felt rushed . <sssss> i would recommend harlow 's cafe to anyone and see myself becoming a frequent customer . 
4		worth a visit . <sssss> the food is solid , the atmosphere interesting , the prices surprisingly cheap . <sssss> mimosas and bloody marys -lrb- big ones -rrb- for 3 bucks . <sssss> that 's what i 'm talking about . <sssss> i 've eaten here twice and both times the service was good . <sssss> i will return . 
4		for those of you who look at our bios , you 'll see i got hooked on w.e.b. griffin 's 10 volume series : `` the corps '' . <sssss> i started out buying the first book at b & n at full price . <sssss> after finishing it , i knew i did n't wanted to pay full price for the rest of the series and the local library did n't have the complete set . <sssss> so i started going to the book tree . <sssss> they are a very reasonable place to buy used books and they give you an opportunity to sell them back when you are finished . <sssss> given the relatively small size of the store , they have a great selection . <sssss> i would recommend them to anyone and certainly would give them a try . <sssss> they have been very friendly and extraordinary helpful in my quest to finish the series . 
4		yeah i `` found '' a new wonderful gelato place , boo , it 's quite a trek across town for me , yeah they have lovely flavors like toberlone , hazelnut , peanut butter and more , boo , the prices are a bit more than i normally pay , yeah , my kids love it , boo , now they are going to want to visit it again , yeah , husband and i can sneak over on date night after eating at herb box , boo , date night wo n't be for a few weeks . <sssss> yeah , the gelato is so authentic the owners are italian , boo , i am frightened they will go out of business like sweet life ! 
4		always good food ! <sssss> , pho da lat is he best in phx , veggie broth , veggie pho with steamed tofu is awesome , and do n't forget to order the quail appetizer :-rrb- . <sssss> . 
4		newer residence inn , high-rise . <sssss> pets accepted for a fee standard fee . <sssss> great pool area . <sssss> the breakfast and dinner is really good . <sssss> the staff is very friendly and accommodating . <sssss> the management staff was very friendly and introduced themselves during the happy hours . 
4		went here for the first time today , and had a really good experience . <sssss> staff was friendly , normal , helpful and nice to be around . <sssss> the restaurant itself is moderately spacious , with bar and table seating . <sssss> food here was awesome ! <sssss> combined with the service , i will be back . <sssss> i could tell that this place has a ton of regulars . <sssss> i liked that . <sssss> what a great gem . <sssss> the food was tasty , fresh and reliable . <sssss> menu had a great selection of items , with a variety of choices and combinations . <sssss> entirely breakfast , probably one of the more overlooked places in town . <sssss> just finding this place now and love it . <sssss> amazing service , great menu . <sssss> parking here is tight , but a staff member guided me in the lot to show me where to go and park . 
4		perfect location for a yogurt shop , for sure ! <sssss> whether you just finished a spicy meal at pei wei , dance class down the way , or are keepin is healthy at subway ... . <sssss> yogurt is the perfect way to finish off he night . <sssss> as a yogurt place this one is just like the rest , but on the good end of the scale . <sssss> clean inside , great flavors they are always rotating out , and plenty of toppings to satisfy anyone -lrb- all kinda of chocolate , fruity pebbles , capt crunch , berries , and lots of chocolate , camels and beyond for sauces -rrb- . <sssss> check 'em out ! 
4		i 'm craving this food right now . <sssss> this location has an awesome expansive dining area - great for groups . <sssss> our server was ah-may-zing ! <sssss> and probably the best baklava i have ever had . <sssss> so glad it is next to my office ! 
4		heres the deal its a great neighborhood go to - the pancakes and omelets are the big draw and the french toast is good to . <sssss> they offer lunch items as well and i dig the shrimp plate :-rrb- staff is really on point and friendly and u find everyone from early worker bees to people in jammy attire : -rrb- 
4		food is good , service is rough sometimes , but the owners are always very friendly ! <sssss> i frequent this place regularly . 
4		great grub after a night out ! <sssss> their chicken wings are yummy . <sssss> they have oodles of tvs around the place so you can catch any sporting event on . <sssss> breakfast is super good and the portion sizes are large . <sssss> prices are definitely within everyone 's budget . <sssss> they do a great job here and the waitresses are saucy gals with great memories . <sssss> always get my order correct . <sssss> bonus !! 
4		went here for a drink while waiting for our table at stingray -lrb- across the street -rrb- and it was very entertaining . <sssss> there was a fun crowd and most people were huddled around the bull . <sssss> you could not pay me to ride a bull in one of these bars , but it is hilarious to watch the drunk guys and girls that attempt it ! <sssss> wish we could have stayed longer , seemed like a fun laidback place . 
4		i walked into sonora brew house - tap room of sunup brewing company - at about 8:00 p.m. after a day 's worth of flights and being turned away from an up-scale restaurant due to an hour-and-a-half wait . <sssss> needless to say , i was n't in the best mood and i had thought i was settling in for an evening of fantastic food served in small portions on pristine white dishes . <sssss> instead , i pulled a 180 and went to sunup because it was close and it was on my food list . <sssss> the interior did n't put me off . <sssss> though it 's not a `` classy '' brewpub , the interior sports soft lighting , spanish colors and a certain amount of elegance . <sssss> i 'm not saying you should take a date here if you 're trying to impress her , but it 's certainly acceptable before or after a movie . <sssss> the atmosphere is laid back . <sssss> a curved bar sits behind a simple floor stacked with numerous square tables both normal and high-top . <sssss> brewing equipment stands behind a plastic wall off to one side . <sssss> a small doorway leads to a narrow room lined with booths on either side . <sssss> the place is not that big , but it 's not small either . <sssss> the menu consists of standard pub fare with a few spanish touches . <sssss> appetizers have the normal dips and fried dishes . <sssss> the homemade bruschetta caught my eye , however . <sssss> it was a bit strong on the garlic and not very well done . <sssss> outside of the typical burgers , sandwiches and wraps , they do feature some interesting entrees . <sssss> i ordered the special - shrimp fajitas . <sssss> it came with one giant flour tortilla which confused me , but overall it was n't bad . <sssss> my friend ordered the salmon which was a much better effort . <sssss> as for the beer , they featured six standard offerings along with three seasonal . <sssss> of the typical offerings , most were a little too sweet and a little low on the hop side , especially those of lighter color meant to appeal to the masses . <sssss> however , the low amounts of hops did allow the floral and citrus notes to come through on the ipa . <sssss> my favorite was the seasonal red along with the vanilla porter , which though sweet , had a robust chocolaty character . <sssss> bonus point for the dry-hopped , cask conditioned version of the ipa as well . <sssss> the service was alright . <sssss> she did n't know much about the beers , but could at least distinguish one from the other via color , even among those that looked quite similar . <sssss> overall , the place is alright . <sssss> i hope there are better offerings in the area . <sssss> but if not , it 'll do . 
4		this is an older location and the area is not an economically prosperous part of town like say scottsdale , but do not let this dictate where you can eat . <sssss> the family and i enjoyed a nice dinner here when heading to a nearby skechers outlet store and yes , we would dine here again . <sssss> the food was very very tasty and explains why we have heard so many good things about macayo 's over the years . <sssss> the service was friendly , helpful and genuine . <sssss> no complaints here - all reasonable prices , and solid food . 
4		iced cocomo chocolate coconut coffee ! <sssss> if you need a premium caffeine fix with the speed and convenience of a drive through , dutch bros coffee is the way to go . <sssss> this was my first experience , and it was good ! <sssss> the quality of the coffee is exceptional with a wide variety of coffee flavors . <sssss> i ordered a `` cocomo '' -lrb- chocolate / coconut -rrb- and my brother-in-law tried the `` annihilator '' -lrb- white chocolate / macadamia nut -rrb- ice coffee . <sssss> i tried both and i think mine was a little richer and sweeter , but i preferred his coffee which was a tad bit lighter with a more nuttier taste . <sssss> prices are on par for any premium coffee , service was fast and friendly and i like the idea of not having to leave the car when it 's 106 degree 's outside . <sssss> all iced coffee 's are upgraded to a medium or large size and multiple shots of espresso can be added for an additional charge . <sssss> recommendation : try the `` annihilator '' if you like a more of a nuttier flavor coffee that is n't too sweet . <sssss> drive through is awesome ! 
4		we were at a relative 's house and starving , luckily yelp was there to help us locate this place ! <sssss> we came on a sunday , which apparently happy hour is all day . <sssss> however , the bar area was packed , so we decided to pass and sat in the dining area - practically all alone ! <sssss> it was nice , since we got to choose where we wanted to sit and our waiter was really friendly and attentive . <sssss> the husband ordered the short ribs and i ordered the steak sandwich . <sssss> the short ribs were good , not the best , but the root vegetables with them were delicious . <sssss> my steak sandwich was really good . <sssss> it was messy , but all tasty sandwiches are messy ! <sssss> the steak had a strong flavor , some sort of spice or rub . <sssss> the french fries that came with the meal were superb . <sssss> they were crunchy and salty - just the way i like them . <sssss> we took a look at the dessert menu and really wanted to order something , but had to pass . <sssss> we 'll definitely be back to try happy hour and the dessert menu ! 
4		we had an issue with our reservation when we first arrived -lrb- only reason for a 4 star rating -rrb- which was quickly corrected after speaking with a manager . <sssss> after that the night was fantastic . <sssss> the food was outstanding , the wine was perfect , and one of the best service experiences i have ever had . <sssss> our server was warner and he was outstanding . <sssss> make sure you ask for him , i know we will when we return . <sssss> the entertainment and dancing was also a nice touch . <sssss> a perfect evening ! 
4		very good cornbread and the street tacos were awsome . 
4		ok , this is one of my favorite type of places - the type where you pick dessert first and then plan your meal accordingly . <sssss> the service was very attentive and , for the record , my steak was very tasty . <sssss> in fact , my steak was better than the one i had at bourbon steak during restaurant week and for about half the price . <sssss> but , the desserts here are truly the stars of the show . <sssss> there is a reason the brownie is `` famous '' and the white choc . <sssss> banana cream pie was wonderful . <sssss> seriously , you will want to cuddle with these desserts when you are done . 
4		stopped by for lunch with a couple of co-workers coming back from a meeting . <sssss> were seating almost immediately as we entered the restaurant , and our waitress took our drink order just as quickly . <sssss> she returned with our drinks and took our order . <sssss> i ordered off the january specials menu and selected the laoded chili potato skillet . <sssss> this also included two eggs -lrb- i had them over hard -rrb- , and toast -lrb- rye toast for me -rrb- . <sssss> the food came out quickly and was hot and delicious . <sssss> while this was not my first time here , i always attempted to try something different from the menu . <sssss> i have never been disappointed . 
4		i 've only ever been one place that does what amados does better than amados does it . <sssss> cheap , delicious mexican food that is available at any time you can dream of eating mexican food . <sssss> this is n't a place to go when you 're looking for astronomical levels of quality ; this is a place to go when you want solid food in big quantities for good prices at unreasonable hours . <sssss> the arizona burrito is awesome , the carne asada is awesome , the carnitas are awesome , and the rest is a step below but still good . <sssss> i 'm not a huge fan of the rolled tacos , but you may see it differently . <sssss> the guacamole is n't great , either , but the hot sauce is pretty darn good so i do n't really mind . <sssss> if you want cheap and convenient , this is your best bet , over the other competitors in the area . <sssss> if you want more of a sit-down place to bring someone , you can find something else . <sssss> your call . <sssss> and do n't wimp out and talk english here . <sssss> the cooks are super friendly and talkative if you 're just willing to use that kid-level spanish you learned in middle school , no matter how gringo your accent is . 
4		la bocca was on my radar since it opened earlier this year ... i can not believe how long it took me to finally get there , but it was worth the wait . <sssss> i went with a group of four on a monday night . <sssss> -lrb- 1/2 price bottles of wine from 5pm - close on mondays ; needless to say , we took advantage of that special ! -rrb- <sssss> we let my friend anthony do the ordering since he 'd been many times before and he also has a vested interest of sorts ... we started with two salads : the prosciutto , zucchini , and artichoke -lrb- my favorite -rrb- and the goat cheese and pear ... also quite tasty . <sssss> you ca n't go wrong with either one . <sssss> we then had the truffled harvest mushroom and the spiced pepperoni pizzas . <sssss> yum ! <sssss> the thin crust and the combination of fresh ingredients on both of them were perfect ! <sssss> along the way , owner julian wright sat down with us to share some wine and conversation - he 's fantastic ! <sssss> while he was completely engaged in talking to our group , i could tell he was also constantly surveying the restaurant to make sure all was running smoothly . <sssss> every patron that walked in the door received immediate attention including our group . <sssss> our waitress was sweet and i liked that she gave some attitude back to jared when he was joking around with her . <sssss> we had a blast on top of a great meal and ended up staying for hours enjoying two bottles of wine -lrb- maybe more than that as i lost track -rrb- during that time . <sssss> one of them was a la crema pinot noir , but i think we had a merlot as well and maybe another italian red . <sssss> i guess i 'll have to go back and take notes next time . <sssss> another reason to return will be to try the brusschetta - it sounds amazing . <sssss> i have a feeling it wo n't take me as long to return to la bocca as it took for me to get there in the first place . <sssss> you ca n't go wrong at la bocca if you 're looking for pizza , salad , wine , and all in a warm , welcoming atmosphere . <sssss> check out their other daily pecials too - i know i will ! 
4		i was expected the typical in n out , five guys , etc. . <sssss> . <sssss> but was not ... ordered create your own 1/3lb -lrb- lettuce , onion , cheddar , mustard , and fresh jalapenos -rrb- , smash fries and a coke . <sssss> very juicy flavorful and just good ! <sssss> i found my new burger joint ! <sssss> it 's not the best i 've had but it is good enough to have me going back for more . <sssss> smash fries have rosemary and garlic and quite frankly you must like rosemary to like the fries . <sssss> i like rosemary ! <sssss> coke products is always a plus for me . <sssss> they also offer rootbeer in a bottle and shakes . <sssss> if you 're looking for a good juicy burger this is the place ... note : i went to the tempe location for a burger to go ... hockey puck ! <sssss> advised the manager and he comped my next meal which was good ... 
4		if it is was n't for the haboob , the girls that came to visit sickie me would have eaten in the east side . <sssss> they stayed on the west side and we decided to go to chef ben 's because a friend 's daughter works there and it is her first job . <sssss> us aunts wanted to say hello and give her a hard time . <sssss> he he he ! <sssss> it was cute & clean place . <sssss> they have a mix of japanese and chinese food . <sssss> i ordered the double chicken -lrb- panko & grilled -rrb- with teriyaki ! <sssss> the teriyaki was sweeter than i like but it was good . <sssss> the service staff was good . <sssss> the prices are reasonable . <sssss> i would come back to visit again ! 
4		this is quite possibly the best pizza i 've ever had ! <sssss> i am always begging to go back to grimaldi 's . <sssss> they only have thin crust pizza which bothered me initially because i 'm not the biggest thin crust fan , but this place has changed my mind ! <sssss> the only potential downside -lrb- and why i knock off one star -rrb- is that it is pretty expensive for pizza . <sssss> we usually drop around $ 50 for one pizza to share , a salad to share , an iced tea , and a glass of wine . <sssss> the taste is worth it though if you have the money to spend ! 
4		great atmosphere . <sssss> the perfect blend of upscale dining and casual atmosphere . <sssss> you can choose to sit inside , at the bar , on the patio , or even out in the grass . <sssss> great appetizers . <sssss> we like to make a whole meal out of them by picking a few different bruschettas and maybe a sandwich . <sssss> and you must try the cucumber , honey limeade . <sssss> so refreshing ! 
4		excellent souvlaki , great service , locally owned . <sssss> i 'm not greek either ; who cares ? <sssss> grape leaves , falafel , baba ghanoush , are indigenous to many parts of the world , including greece . <sssss> go to any greek , lebanese , or persian restaurant in town and all these dishes will vary slightly . <sssss> very good food and very good service in a quaint restaurant . <sssss> it 's worth a stop for lunch or dinner . 
4		i believe i 've said this before but i 'll say it again . <sssss> i 'm not a fan of italian food , but la famiglia pizza & pasta restaurant does a really great job at making me one . <sssss> i like calzone 's and theirs did n't disappoint . <sssss> the mozzarella and ricotta cheese was wonderfully stuffed inside the pizza dough . <sssss> the small one is huge ! <sssss> i like the fact that they put the sauce on the side and not inside . <sssss> the pizza sauce is not overly spicy for me and has a sweet taste , which in my world makes it really yummy . <sssss> tonight we visited them again and and i tried the stuff shells . <sssss> i took a - long my son-in-law , daughter . <sssss> two grandchildren and my husband . <sssss> everyone loved what they ordered . <sssss> i tried my husbands baked ziti and i will definitely add that to my list of must tries . <sssss> the owners make everyone feel like family and i think this place is worth a visit even if you do n't like italian food . 
4		i 'm lucky cause lgo is in my neighborhood . <sssss> this little spot has the best ready-made sushi rolls around and the atmosphere is unmatched -- great energy with a mish-mash of different kinds of people . <sssss> lgo attracts everyone and for good reason -- they 've got a great selection of sandwiches , pizzas , desserts , and beverages at reasonable prices coupled with a laid-back vibe that you just ca n't find just anywhere else in the city . 
4		do n't stay here . <sssss> i mean it , i want rooms available for when i need to go back into phoenix/tempe . <sssss> i had a horrible experience at the red roof in burbank and was leery about booking here because of it , but the price was excellent and the location good enough for my needs . <sssss> if this had turned out in any way negative , i would have sworn off of red roof completely . <sssss> thankfully , this was a great experience . <sssss> the room was clean , everything worked -lrb- well , the free wifi was a bit slow , but oh well -rrb- , the bed was comfortable , the staff friendly , and they allowed pets -lrb- good note for future travel -rrb- . <sssss> everything was a lot better than i would expect for the price . <sssss> and you really ca n't beat the price , especially for that location . <sssss> good food nearby , easy to get to . <sssss> i would absolutely recommend staying here . 
4		i try not to write too much about chains , but we came here for happy hour , we we went too familiar with their menu and we kinda screwed up our order and got way too much food , it was kind of a breakdown between customer and server , but we had to bite the bullet on some of it and still pay for more than we ordered , but they also helped out by knocking off a couple bucks and then giving us free apps the next time were in . 
4		located off hayden just s of costco and n of raintree rd on the east side of the road . <sssss> the parking lot is a little scary but there is a decent amount of parking . <sssss> i called and ordered pho soup for pickup and they said it would be ready 5-10 mins . <sssss> when i arrived it was being wrapped up in the back . <sssss> the man at the desk was very nice . <sssss> they do delivery through a delivery company but they charge by distance i believe . <sssss> the inside was very cute . <sssss> the pictures make it look a lot fancier than it is , but most vietnamese places are hole in the walls , so this was definitely a step up from that . <sssss> when i got the soup home it was still warm . <sssss> not hot or cold which was great . <sssss> i added everything into the broth and the basil aroma just filled my kitchen . <sssss> they did include a fork , spoon and chop sticks which was great . <sssss> the flavors were all there but it definitely could have had some more basil , noodles and sprouts personally . <sssss> i do n't hold this against them though because delivery is always a little different than on location . <sssss> i will definitely be returning ! <sssss> the price was great and the menu had plenty to chose from ! <sssss> they have been around since 2005 and definitely deserve to stay around !! 
4		you are now aware that zookz makes uncrustables for grown-ups . <sssss> and while you ca n't get a pb&j , they are delicious . <sssss> i must have stumbled upon a meeting of sorts during my first visit to zookz . <sssss> about six workers stopped , looked my way , and greeted me with huge smiles . <sssss> i can tell when someone is faking it , and these grins sure were genuine ! <sssss> i wanted the very best they had to offer , so without hesitation i went for their most popular lunch -- turkey , bacon , avocado , and sweet mustard . <sssss> it came with a tiny , but scrumptious side salad of kale , craisins , and walnuts . <sssss> delightful ! <sssss> some say these are small , but this is a right-size lunch at a good price . <sssss> totally snagged a little jug of apple juice with my sandwich and dropped less than $ 9 for a satisfying meal . <sssss> a fair criticism to ding a star for is that it 's not as flavorful as the ingredients would suggest . <sssss> rather than an eclectic sandwich , it almost tastes like the best grilled cheese you 've had in your life . <sssss> i would use less cheese and probably go for something sharper , just to let everything else shine . <sssss> whoever writes the menu has some creativity and a keen palate for mixing flavors . <sssss> if you 're around cenpho and seeking a tasty , casual lunch , do n't pass this place up ! 
4		grimaldis gets a big yay from me . <sssss> the pizza is flavorful , fresh and very very yummy . <sssss> i love the crust its thin but not too thin , the sauce is just right and the toppings are plentiful . <sssss> only thing is , my pizza gets cold by the time i 've finished scarfing down the first two slices . <sssss> we normally get two pizzas , one for each , and i just wonder if mine comes out first and sits there a few minutes before the other comes out . <sssss> almost everytime we go my pizza is on the cooler side . <sssss> so i guess that would be my only complaint . <sssss> the cannoli is reallllly good too , a definite must try . <sssss> when the weather is pleasant , sit outside on the patio that over looks the water , very nice . <sssss> so if you 're looking for a good pizza and a nice restaurant , grimaldis is a place to try . 
4		seriously the best pastrami downtown , and all of the valley as far as i 'm concerned . <sssss> its a little pricey for lunch , but highly recommended if you want a real deli style sandwich . <sssss> this place has been around for a long time , and while there are numerous -lrb- and good -rrb- sandwich options downtown , i think this joint is a step above just for the quality of the product . 
4		vanilla and pecan - the best ! <sssss> not a big fan of the toppings since i see kids with their fingers always in them . <sssss> usually get a tub and add my own toppings at home - if even needed . 
4		the old adage , `` you get what you pay for '' really applies here to this fancy-assed grocery store . <sssss> here 's the pluses ... most of their pre-cooked food , sandwiches , iced teas , desserts , sushi and what not is really good , verging on almost always excellent . <sssss> here 's the one and only minus - everyday shopping should be done somewhere else unless you have cash to burn . <sssss> i get no thrill from paying 2 dollars more for ketchup just because it 's a nice joint . <sssss> great meat and produce , good beer prices , and even cool gift items & flowers . 
4		went with my cuz for thanksgiving dinner . <sssss> -lrb- not a traditional turkey lover -rrb- good times . <sssss> really liked the decor . <sssss> very trendy and modern . <sssss> loved the piano player . <sssss> i wish there were more bars like this around here . <sssss> food was great . <sssss> service was real good too . <sssss> i had dumplings and pork lomein and my cuz at a spicy veggie tofu dish . <sssss> he could not stop raving about it . <sssss> all in all we feasted with a few other dishes and spent about $ 75 total . <sssss> well worth it and we have decided we will go back sooner than later . 
4		rocket burger 's homemade onion rings are some of the best i 've ever had . <sssss> i love the california burger , and the gyro burger is super awesome . <sssss> i always make sure to steal a bite of andy f 's rocket burger -lrb- it 's three patties ! <sssss> on a sub roll ! <sssss> so epic -rrb- . <sssss> part of the fun of eating at rocket burger is spending way too long examining all the soda options - last time , i found a dandelion soda , but was just too chicken to try it -lrb- but you should - and tell me about it ! -rrb- <sssss> the owners and staff are lovely , and you can tell they really care about this place . <sssss> andy and i actually had a really terrible experience our first time here -lrb- waited an hour + for food that was cold on arrival , etc -rrb- , and when andy yelped about it , the owner reached out . <sssss> he said there was no excuse for the terrible service , but he 'd instituted some changes and hoped we 'd come back . <sssss> we 've been back a dozen times since that fateful day , and never once have we regretted it ! <sssss> well , i regret not having tried all the sodas . <sssss> but i feel i made a valiant effort ! 
4		i 've been here a few times and always seem to have a good time . <sssss> the beer is cold and they have drink specials all the time . <sssss> their servers are friendly and hustle for you . <sssss> the outdoor patio can be somewhat smokey so sit as far away from the patio if the smoke bothers you . <sssss> there is a guy that sings and plays the guitar in the evening . <sssss> there 's some floor to ceiling tv 's so you can see all the sporting events . <sssss> i think their burgers are below meh , eventhough they are $ 5 on monday night . <sssss> the flat bread for 1/2 price off on wednesday is a great deal . <sssss> their chicken fingers are tasty as well . <sssss> i have had their tortilla soup which was good but not great . <sssss> my favorite dish so far is the fish & chips -lrb- fries -rrb- . <sssss> this dish is $ 14 for dinner and $ 9 for lunch . <sssss> the fish is fried in a batter and is delicious . <sssss> this is their signature dish ; so you should definitely order the fish . <sssss> since this is a seahawks bar , i guess they wo n't allow any bears fans in the pub this sunday . <sssss> other than being seahawks fans , these guys are ok . 
4		love this place . <sssss> great greek gyro with fries . <sssss> they offer free soup but i have n't tried it . <sssss> the meal is plenty enough for anyone and trust me you 'll eat it all . <sssss> the best greek food in the west valley since ararat closed down . 
4		anything goes at the duce . <sssss> this is a warehouse , trailer park , and backyard all rolled into one . <sssss> everything in the duce is vintage . <sssss> i love the picnic table concept and food truck kitchen . <sssss> the food has some serious down-home feel to it . <sssss> they have mac & cheese muffins , sweet potato chips and noodle kugel with granny smith apples . <sssss> i did n't know what kugel was but it was delicious . <sssss> the chicken sausage sliders are my favorite . <sssss> the duce knows how to makes some serious cocktails . <sssss> they use fresh ingredients and serve up their cocktails in manson jars . <sssss> i do n't think i 've had a drink on their menu i did n't like . <sssss> old fashioneds and moscow mules are my favorite and the duce 's creations are perfect ! <sssss> the duce is a unique place that will be great to meet friends before a game or just a night out for drinks . 
4		i 've been there twice and i like it . <sssss> i have three small chihuahuas and this past friday afternoon was fantastic . <sssss> i was hesitant because the area itself is pretty small and there were a lot of dogs , about 15 ? <sssss> but they were the biggest group of well behaved dogs i have ever come across . <sssss> the owners seem pretty attentive also . <sssss> for some reason there are two fenced in areas that alternate between days . <sssss> it would be cool if they would make one into a small dog area , but honestly if ever day is like the one i had on friday , it would be unnecessary . 
4		the outdoor seating could become legendary at this location once more people learn about it . <sssss> i mean it is simply magnificent ... go at night if you can and i can promise you it is romantic ... exotic ... and exciting all rolled into one . <sssss> since it is near the ipic theatre in the scottsdale quarter ... it makes for a great location to go and grab dinner once your movie has concluded . <sssss> the most awesome thing about the whole place though is the fire cauldrons that are located near the escalators as you walk into the restaurant ... wow . <sssss> so if your ever in the quarters and want something a little different but yet the same at least by scottsdale 's lofty standards ... then pay a visit to tanzy . <sssss> eat , drink , and be merry my friends !!!! 
4		boba tea ! <sssss> that 's all i visit this place for . <sssss> i ca n't get enough of the milk teas & smoothies with boba ! 
4		great all natural selection , if you are looking for some fruit or veggie that is hard to find , try here , they will probably have it . <sssss> i also love that they have organic roasted chickens -lrb- yummy -rrb- . <sssss> the stores often have wine tastings and demos going on , check their website for listings of events . 
4		nice place to peruse for books and dvds ... they also have a musical instruments section ! 
4		just went for an early valentines dinner , the place is amazing ! <sssss> the service was great , we had two servers so every request was met . <sssss> the food is really good , but it 's the only reason i did n't give 5 stars . <sssss> the food is a bit pricy , but you 're paying for the experience . <sssss> the wine list is great , and reasonably priced . <sssss> the best part , by far is being able to see the birds eye view of phoenix , awesome ! 
4		great course . <sssss> over all a stunning course with perfect grounds , but i guess october is a great month there . <sssss> not to hot . <sssss> it was in the low 80 's when i played . <sssss> do you play golf or do you golf ? <sssss> well i golfed and i kicked a. ... . <sssss> . <sssss> sk me later . <sssss> if you can you need to hi this course . <sssss> lots of bev carts and club house has a great view . <sssss> i realy liked the two palm trees that leaned to a perfect `` a '' at top . <sssss> i was hoping that pot of ` gold was under it . <sssss> have fun 
4		good food , good atmosphere , friendly staff . <sssss> patio is dog friendly , they even brought out water for our 130 pound rottie , he loved it ! <sssss> great place to take the kids , they love the free chocolate fountain . <sssss> chips and salsa are fabulous ! 
4		in the past year or so i have become a bbq nut . <sssss> i think it started when i finally went to henry 's high life back home in san jose . <sssss> ever since then i 've been trying different bbq . <sssss> in my search i came upon joe 's . <sssss> my daughter and i went there one sunday evening around 5:30 pm and the place was hoppin ! <sssss> there was a long line but it moved quickly . <sssss> the smell of pecan wood filled the air and all around us families sat at tables devouring pulled pork , ribs , and brisket . <sssss> it looked yummy . <sssss> it 's a bit like a cafeteria in that you stand in line , get your tray , silverware and drink and then approach the food to tell the person behind the counter what you would like . <sssss> i have a half rack of ribs with a baked potato the size of both my fists !!! <sssss> it was huge but it was probably the best baked potato i have had in years . <sssss> and the ribs were delicious . <sssss> the sauce was sweet and gave a nice accent to the meat . <sssss> the meat fell off the bone . <sssss> my daughter had a pulled pork sandwich and i took a bite ... . <sssss> it was yummy too . <sssss> everything is fresh and tasty !! <sssss> one of my favorite things about joe 's is their home made root beer . <sssss> i do n't know of any other place that serves home made root beer . <sssss> this was the bomb !!! <sssss> i could have drank a gallon of it !! <sssss> joe 's is the real deal . <sssss> it 's a great family friendly place . <sssss> the night i was there it was packed with families chowing down on some good bbq . <sssss> and i got the feeling these were not first time visiters , it felt like everyone there was having a good time and getting a good meal . <sssss> it felt like home . 
4		i 'm sad that the a 's are leaving this stadium . <sssss> why oh why ca n't they stay ? <sssss> i have been coming to phoenix muni to watch the a 's play since i was a little girl and now that they are moving i wo n't know what to do ! <sssss> this park has character just like the oakland colliseum . <sssss> it is close to both scottsdale , tempe and downtown phoenix and close to the light rail . <sssss> the park has decent seating . <sssss> it 's a solid park in my opinion ! 
4		stopped by with the kids for open skate on saturday . <sssss> at $ 15 a kid it was n't cheap . <sssss> but , considering alternatives , we got in a solid three hours of fun ... more than i can say for just going to a movie which would have likely cost about the same when you add everything up . 
4		i wish i 'd gotten the waiter 's name . <sssss> he was incredible . <sssss> the drinks were ` well balanced , ' i.e. not watered down . <sssss> i got the naked guacamole . <sssss> it was super bland but i mixed the salsa in and it was better . <sssss> also got the shrimp tacos and they were great . <sssss> the rice was overcooked but whatever . <sssss> i would n't recommend it to friends but i 'm not upset about the experience . <sssss> the waiter made the experience good even though the food was nothing to write home about . <sssss> beyond the food , my other complaint is seating . <sssss> the raised seat limits my parents and my in-laws from attending . 
4		i just got my dog from the arizona humane society and they suggested vca . <sssss> i was very happy with the care they gave coco , and the time they spent with her . <sssss> someone who has had a dog for quite some time suggested that maybe they were trying to suggest too many tests and meds for me to `` buy '' that were n't necessary but i do n't know that to be the case . <sssss> she 's new to me and i do n't know her history so i think it 's better safe than sorry . <sssss> the medicine they gave me for her ear infection perked her up immediately . <sssss> i 'm going to take her back there for sure . 
4		as anyone who follows my yelps knows , we are new to town and trying to find the ` heart ' of aj . <sssss> mickey d 's is what small town america is all about !!! <sssss> the biscuits and gravy -lrb- call them b&g if you want to fit in -rrb- are out of this world ! <sssss> both the biscuits and the gravy are obviously made in house with quality ingredients . <sssss> coffee is poured into your cup almost immediately and you get the ` welcome ' feeling right away ! <sssss> the owner spotted that we were newbies and gave us a tour and took our suggestions for menu ideas to heart . <sssss> they see their customers as real people and are open 365 days a year ! <sssss> on the down side ... i would have given them 5 stars except i did have trouble finding a healthy choice for breakfast and the coffee was a bit weak . <sssss> i chose the oatmeal , which was average ... some steel cut oats , blueberries , granola , yogurt and wheat toast would have been incredible . <sssss> ! <sssss> but now i know what to expect and will be adding a few more cheat days to my life :-rrb- ! 
4		yummmm ! <sssss> im a regular and sometimes forget to check in but a great app in the stuffed mushrooms or the monkey brains ! <sssss> wings are great too but if you like them fried just a heads up these are not . 
4		this place has great food . <sssss> they are pricey , it 's crowded and loud but the food is amazing and so are their signature drinks . <sssss> they also have terrific service which i loved . 
4		its a chain , its in a mall and it was busy . <sssss> i was prepared for a pretty poor experience . <sssss> what we got instead was great food , very attentive service and a wide menu that accommodated our gf and dairy-free needs . <sssss> it was a friday during lent so we were confined to seafood or veggies . <sssss> my wife loved her mushroom enchiladas - probably the best dish we had . <sssss> my baked seafood enchiladas defintely gave it a run for the money though . <sssss> my son had the diablo pasta with shrimp and finished it before i got a bite . <sssss> we were there to watch an ncaa game and enjoyed it thoroughly , with a crowd of folks getting into the game with us . <sssss> much , much better than i expected when i showed up - we 'll be looking for these in the future . 
4		challenger space center is one of those places to go if you are a : astronomy , nasa , space , astrophysics , or science nut . <sssss> with a special emphasis on nasa and space . <sssss> i started coming here way back when i was a young student on a quest to become an aerospace engineer . <sssss> there is an indoor planetarium and there are three levels of exhibits and memorabilia they offer guided tours and stargazing evenings and their two hour flight simulated missions require a reservation for an additional fee . <sssss> i also saw some fliers for birthday parties , apparently they host birthday parties for your little geek or geekette . <sssss> we walked around , i saw an astronaut suit entombed behind some glass . <sssss> the gift shop has loads of things all related to space , all freeze dried foods , space games , toys etc. . <sssss> this place is just far enough there never seems to be anyone else there . <sssss> the space missions are very educational and fun . <sssss> rendezvous with a comet is every sat and you work together on a team to successfully meet up with the comet 's tail . <sssss> voyage to mars is every third sat and you work as the first flight crew on mars . 
4		pretty solid pizza offerings here . <sssss> was in town to visit a friend and i heard about this place that served chicago style pizza . <sssss> while it is n't as good as the chitown joints i 've been to , it 's still cranks out a pretty good pizza pie . <sssss> the only drawback to ordering chicago style pizza is that it takes so long to cook -lrb- it is a thick pie -rrb- . <sssss> while there are other options on the menu -lrb- thin pizzas and pastas -rrb- , i opted to wait for my thick and juicy pizza . <sssss> overall it was pretty good and tasty and the service was decent , even though it was pretty slammed when we were there . <sssss> thumbs up . 
4		wanted to go to a gastropub , and ended up here . <sssss> this is a really nice place inside . <sssss> comfortable seating of all types . <sssss> a big bar . <sssss> the kitchen is wide open for all to see . <sssss> the restrooms are clean and nice , too . <sssss> we ordered ; triple fried duck fries -lrb- excellent fries -rrb- , chicken liver mousse -lrb- this was absolutely excellent - could not stop eating -rrb- , bone marrow -lrb- very good flavor -rrb- , candied pork belly -lrb- quite good -rrb- . <sssss> thoruoughly enjoyed my experience here . <sssss> the service was excellent . <sssss> also tried 3 of their tasy signature drinks ; maple glazed old fashioned , frozen ` rita , and another . <sssss> a great place to dine ! 
4		we stayed here this past weekend as it was super conveniently located to the start and finish lines of the rock and roll half marathon . <sssss> we checked in late in the day on saturday after driving out from la and having spent the evening getting our race packets in phoenix and drinking beer at four peaks . <sssss> the guy at check in -lrb- i think his name was dan -rrb- was extremely friendly , energetic and efficient . <sssss> we were pleasantly surprised by how modern , clean and well appointed our room was . <sssss> it had an actual full kitchen -lrb- pots and pans , dishes , dishwasher , full size fridge -rrb- , a little couch , a queen sized bed and a tiny balcony with a view of nothing . <sssss> literally , my only complaints about the room were that i wished it had a king bed rather than a queen but i know that i 'm being picky and a queen bed is totally sufficient and that the climate control was easier to figure out because i totally had a fight with that thing . <sssss> the control panel has 3 buttons - a red arrow up , a blue arrow down and a fan button . <sssss> i could not for the life of me figure out how to switch it to just fan so the ac or heat would n't cycle on and off every 10 minutes . <sssss> then the unit started making a weird bomb like ticking sound , so we just gave up and switched off the power to it in the breaker box so then it was a little stuffy , but we dealt . <sssss> we missed breakfast the next morning because we overslept and were rushing to get to the run on time , but we did swing by on our second morning there and it 's a standard free breakfast - weak coffee , plentiful carbs -lrb- bagels , oatmeal , cereal , muffins -rrb- and a few hot choices -lrb- scrambled eggs , potatoes and potato/sausage mix -rrb- but it was enough to keep us from being starving for the earlier part of our drive . <sssss> what is really special was that the pool , spa and firepit that are on the roof are open 24 hours . <sssss> we did n't take advantage of any of that because there were some college girls gathered chatting around the firepit drinking wine and we were so tired all we wanted was quiet , but so many hotels i 've stayed at close the pool at 7 which is way too early . <sssss> i do n't forsee a reason to go back to tempe in the future , but i would absolutely recommend this hotel as a solid option if you 're looking for something clean and convenient in the area . 
4		the monastery is unlike anywhere you 've probably been before . <sssss> natalie 's description gives a great idea ... almost the whole thing is outside , with large sand volleyball courts , outdoor grills where you cook your own food -lrb- purchase it seasoned and ready to go there -rrb- , swings , fire pits , etc. . <sssss> i like it in the winter when its nice enough during the day to play volleyball then cool enough at night to bundle up in a hoodie and pretend youre at a bonfire . <sssss> i also like it when the near-professional near-naked volleyball boys come to play on friday nights . <sssss> i just appreciate good sports . <sssss> the only thing i dont like about the monastery is how many people bring their kids . <sssss> thats really just because i 'm not a fan of them at all right now , so dont take it personally . <sssss> the place is actually pretty well set-up for kids and i guess if they werent so annoying in general , it would be a decent scene for them . <sssss> there is a sectioned off sand area for them with toys and stuff yet of course they run amock ... grrrrr ... whatever . <sssss> dont expect a scottsdale crowd at all , this mesa bar is just that -- a place to kick back and relax with friends . <sssss> change is good my friends . 
4		per their slogan i saw on a magnet , a friend and i came to this nook of a restaurant to have a nook-see . <sssss> i 'm actually not sorry for that sentence . <sssss> in reality , we were disappointed . <sssss> let me elaborate . <sssss> we came here set on trying poutine , but the deep fryer was down , so that was not an option . <sssss> we arrived in time for happy hour , so we settled for trying the chicken chop off of that menu and the florentine pizza from the dinner menu . <sssss> you generally do n't expect too much from salad , but we were definitely raving about that chicken chop . <sssss> the way we described it was that each leaf had flavor painted on it , and not soaked like most salads . <sssss> plus the chicken was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside . <sssss> pretty much the highlight of the meal ... oddly enough . <sssss> the florentine pizza had ample amount of spinach and globs of ricotta cheese on it . <sssss> i 'm a fan of ricotta , but i would have preferred it being spread out rather than just dolloped on my pizza . <sssss> it makes for a very confusing look . <sssss> i forgot what the menu had described it as and thought i was getting mashed potato portions on my pizza . <sssss> go figure . <sssss> the pizza dough was delicious and it 's nice to see the dough right over the bar so you know you 're not getting some frozen goods . <sssss> it 's big enough to share with someone else , which cushions the price . <sssss> it was yummy , but not extraordinary . <sssss> we would definitely come back for the salad and to have better luck at trying the poutine . <sssss> on a side note , decor was very simple and cute . <sssss> and the bathroom -lrb- do people review bathrooms ?! <sssss> eh ... well , i 'm going to ... -rrb- had a scrub to use for your hands which after using tempted me very much to buy it . <sssss> it 's an in house product if any one cared to get their hands on it . <sssss> maybe next time , nook . 
4		i love joe 's !!!! <sssss> he always has awesome bands playing . <sssss> the bartenders are generous with the alcohol . <sssss> i love it . <sssss> the only thing is i live so far away so i dont get to frequent them often . 
4		i felt bad about not taking my dog to the dog park as much as i used to but since moving to north phoenix there 's just not a lot of selection . <sssss> the one that 's closest to me is muddy and gross and the really nice one in scottsdale is a pretty far drive which is no fun with a dog who wants to run around . <sssss> luckily my best friend mentioned this one which is only about 5-10 minutes from me . <sssss> we decided to check it out with our fur babies and see if it was any good . <sssss> it 's easy to drive past when you 're coming up cave creek to find it but once you know where it is you wo n't miss it again . <sssss> there is a pretty good amount of parking so i do n't see that being an issue . <sssss> the area for the dogs is pretty good sized , is all grass so not muddy and there is a doggy drinking fountain and quite a few chairs scattered around . <sssss> i noticed that even the area for the small dogs was large so they did n't skimp for the little ones like some dog parks do . <sssss> needless to say my dog had fun , got a bunch of exercise and made some new friends . <sssss> plus there were no dirty footprints left in my car when we went to leave . <sssss> i 'm very happy i found a good dog park near me so i wo n't feel like such a bad mommy anymore ! 
4		i have been wanting to try her for awhile ! <sssss> happy hour is amazing , i had a strawberry basil drink that was super yummy ! <sssss> i really enjoyed my food . <sssss> i would n't recommend siting outside unless you 're okay with random dogs coming up to you because they are allowed to be on the patio and not everyone uses a leash . 
4		amazinggggggg ! <sssss> i loved walking in and having the smell of a fresh toasted sandwich in my nose . <sssss> the owners are super italian and the main guy makes sure everyone is taken care of and is having a good time . <sssss> he loves fifties music and signs along with it while he 's making crepes . <sssss> i ordered the grilled cheese which has sharp cheddar , tomatoes , pesto , and avocado . <sssss> i 'm usually picky and like my food to be as simple as possible but the sandwich was awesome . <sssss> my friend got a southwest sandwich which has chicken and peppers which was also really good . <sssss> we ended up staying there for two hours cause we became so comfortable with the place and the staff . <sssss> the owner even gave us a free banana crepe with ice cream . <sssss> the only reason it does n't get a full five stars is because there was miss communication between our waiter and the chef . <sssss> we had to wait for quite a while to order because our waiter thought we had already put it in . <sssss> the other downside is that it was a tid bit pricey for not including any sides like fries or chips . <sssss> but still loved it overall . 
4		i got ta give credit where credit is due : for a corporate behometh sbux delivers . <sssss> they 're not selling coffee but rather an experience - consistency , speed , friendly service , a good meeting spot , and free wifi . <sssss> this particular location does n't have great inside seating areas , but the covered patio makes it a little more appealing to sit and enjoy . <sssss> best of all the staff is always happy and will turn your frown upside down . 
4		despite a bad experience , i will still give this palace a trial . <sssss> first , it 's reasonably authentic foods if you ask for the `` black '' menu to order the real szechwan foods . <sssss> second , it helps if you know the waiter and he can prepare something totally off the menu -lrb- only if you know what you wants obviously -rrb- . <sssss> i have been here with various groups of mixed friends . <sssss> they have all enjoyed it . <sssss> i enjoy spicy foods ... not a must in all dishes but only if it compliments the taste . <sssss> i usually gun for the water boiled dishes . <sssss> in the recent past , i had ordered a simple dish ma po tofu . <sssss> it 's spicy hot but it 's also very salty . <sssss> after 2 bites , the water tasted like sea water for a day . <sssss> i do n't think it 's supposed to be made that way . <sssss> maybe they screwed it up in the kitchen . <sssss> my most recent visit with friends , we had water boiled fish , stirred fried egg plants , and lamb with cumin -lrb- not really on the menu -rrb- . <sssss> we all enjoyed it . <sssss> the water boiled fish was toned down on spice for unknown reason . <sssss> i did not burn my tongue by the salt content . <sssss> we enjoyed the experience . <sssss> the ambiance is usually nice ... very bright and clean . <sssss> the deco is of modern chinese . <sssss> the waiters have been reasonably attentive during most visits . <sssss> diners , if you want authentic szechwan foods , go for the black . <sssss> once you go black , you wo n't go back , only in phoenix . 
4		spicy chai for the win ! 
4		this restaurant deserves 5-stars for its great food , great price -lrb- less than $ 6 for almost all main dishes -rrb- , and great authentic selections . <sssss> it 's one of the best vietnamese restaurants in the phoenix area . <sssss> broth has so much flavor , good portions for all noddle soup and rice plates , and also have good variety of desserts to choose from . <sssss> to me , their service is typical for an asian restaurant that does n't overcharge you for good food . <sssss> by western standards , their service is lacking -lrb- better if you speak the language -rrb- . <sssss> they do seat you right away even when they are busy , and food comes out fast , but do n't expect much more than that . <sssss> they do accept all major credit cards . <sssss> you can eat a lot for 2 people at this place under $ 20 ! 
4		pretty fancy place they have here , nestled in a strip mall near a boba shop , lee lee market , and a chinese restaurant . <sssss> pho van has a large and well decorated dining room with a fish tank , plenty if gigantic televisions , and nice tile . <sssss> if nothing else , they went a bit overboard with the decorating . <sssss> the service here is very friendly , prompt , and helpful . <sssss> i observed a table nearby asking what just about everything on the menu was like , and the lady serving that table was very patient and explained everything in detail , described how it was prepared , and what it tasted like . <sssss> i knew what i wanted coming in , so i did n't get a chance to `` test '' the server , but i 'm sure he was just as good . <sssss> i really enjoyed my bun thit nuong cha gio , as the pork had a delicious lime like marinade to it , and the egg rolls were crisp and fresh tasting . <sssss> they are very generous with the portion sizes , and they should be for what they are charging . <sssss> they definitely tacked on a dollar to their prices probably to pay for those fancy televisions and the new tile floors . <sssss> my one bowl with no sides , drinks , or appetizers , was $ 11 after tip . <sssss> outrageous . <sssss> i wanted goi cuon , but an order of two was $ 5.75 ! <sssss> i also wanted a beer , just to say i had a beer with my vietnamese , as most places do n't serve it . <sssss> well , the beer would have been $ 4 , making lunch here for one with a beer , an appetizer , and a main about $ 22 after tax and tip . <sssss> would it be worth it ? <sssss> probably not considering all of the place which cost slightly more than half of what pho van charges . <sssss> want to introduce someone to vietnamese ? <sssss> take a casual client out to lunch somewhere relatively nice ? <sssss> maybe really want a beer with lunch ? <sssss> pho van is great . <sssss> want to have an inexpensive lunch and do n't care about atmosphere , but rather just good quality food ? <sssss> probably not a good bet . <sssss> your wallet will hate you here . 
4		it 's good ! <sssss> well , my wicked sandwich was . <sssss> so was the service . 
4		vitamin t has been my go to spot for food and drinks before catching a game downtown . <sssss> you ca n't go wrong with any of the tacos on the menu , especially my favorite the pibil . <sssss> last time in i tired the bacon wrapped hot dog -lrb- sonoran dog -rrb- and it was quite delicious and filling , however if it your first time in , just stick with the tacos they wo n't disappoint . <sssss> wash it down with a dos equis and a chilled shot of tequila . <sssss> this place is n't going to break the bank , and will get you full and a lil buzzed before heading into the stadium to be tempted with 9 dollar boring hot dogs and 10 dollar beers . <sssss> the place still seems to be a lil hidden , every time i go in its never busy . <sssss> do n't let this fool you , give it a shot . 
4		bethany and michelle are wonderful hosts and very accommodating . <sssss> the hotel is located just north of the downtown area and has a beautiful bar area . <sssss> food is delicious and the peach ginger soda is amazing ! 
4		coooookies !!! <sssss> it 's fall and you know what that means : ginger molasses cookies at paradise bakery ! <sssss> just when you got tired of the lemon cookies -lrb- how could you ? -rrb- <sssss> , they release their seasonal specialty . <sssss> yum ! <sssss> but if you must have `` real '' food , they have a great southwest chicken ceasar salad with enough spice to make you guzzle a couple cups of mango iced tea . <sssss> their sandwiches are pretty good , and i 'm partial to the turkey with cranberry or the chicken walnut . <sssss> bonus ? <sssss> you get a cookie for free ! 
4		yup in n out of chicken 
4		the good : unlimited seafood for 14 bucks . <sssss> this includes sushi and crab legs . <sssss> the bad : okay , it is n't bad , per se , but most of the food tastes like buffet food . <sssss> it is generally good , but after trying a little of most everything they had to offer , nothing stands out as something i just have to have more of . <sssss> they do an excellent job at serving tons of good seafood to tons of people . <sssss> the sushi was good , not great , but for the money , it was a really nice addition to the menu . <sssss> also , see below ... the funny : well , it was n't funny at the time ... but it made for some interesting people watching ... i 'm not sure if they have crab legs every night , but the night i went they did . <sssss> they were very busy that night , and crab legs were obviously the main thing people came in for . <sssss> it seemed like they rationed the crab legs by bringing them in in 10-15 minute intervals , so for much of the visit , the section of the buffet where they served them would be empty . <sssss> as soon as the employees would bring out the next load of them , people descended on them like famished scavengers . <sssss> one time , i was fortuitous enough to be at the right place at the right time when they came out , and there was only one man between me and a few crab legs . <sssss> i patiently waited while he filled his plate with as many as he could carry back . <sssss> i stepped forward and all of a sudden a little girl , about eight , stepped in front of me and grabbed the tongs and said `` can i have one ? '' <sssss> i said sure -lrb- as any other respectable man in the presence of a cute eight year old with cute dreadlocks would do , right ? -rrb- <sssss> , and i let her ahead . <sssss> about 30 seconds later , her plate was filled higher than the man before me -- and between her and the other side -lrb- you can access the crab legs from two sides of the buffet , nearly entire stock had been taken . <sssss> i did get a few of the small leftovers that were somehow left , and retreated to my seat . <sssss> as i sat down , i saw two women in a nearby booth ... each of which probably had their own gravitational pull . <sssss> their entire table was filled with plates of crab legs and the sad aftermath of the crab carnage that had taken place in the preceding moments . <sssss> as it turns out , there were three different tables of people who were all together , probably 15 people in all . <sssss> the little girl i so graciously let in front of me belonged to one of them , as did the ladies . <sssss> all three tables had massive amounts of crab legs , even the table with only young kids ... who in reality probably had no real hope of enjoying them because they had no adult supervision ... and no obvious way to open them . <sssss> after watching for a few minutes , i realized that the two planets , i mean , ladies , never got up . <sssss> instead , i saw that each of the kids at the various tables was taking shifts to get to the crab legs as they were brought out from the back . <sssss> each kid would go up and collect as many as he or she could and bring it back to be divvied up amongst the tables . <sssss> sometimes two kids would each attack a side of the buffet , leaving little or nothing for the remainder of us . <sssss> the little girl was no little girl at all , she was but a mere sattelite charged with collecting all the crab legs she could to satiate the hunger of the mothership . <sssss> that 's a long story to tell you that while the allure of crab legs is a strong one , be prepared to fight , stalk , and trick your way into getting your share of them . <sssss> personally , while they are good , i 'd rather go somewhere that charges a few more bucks but does n't ration the product -- allowing an impolite galaxy of scavengers to ruin it for everyone else . <sssss> still four stars for it because as an overall the place was impressive , but maybe they could figure some way around this problem by having a server bring the crab legs to each individual table as needed on a more even basis . 
4		this place has a great casual vibe and an eclectic mix of diners . <sssss> on tuesdays they have a great special offering of pizza and a bottle of wine/sangria for $ 20 . <sssss> the best thing on the menu is the buffalo dip , but everything i have tried on the menu is good . <sssss> the menu is diverse so it has ` something for everyone ' in your party . <sssss> i recommend this place for happy hour , lunch , or dinner . <sssss> you can even bring your dog if you sit outside . 
4		very good food , the french dip was excellent . <sssss> definitely worth a try . 
4		i like this one . <sssss> i just wish they had wifi . 
4		sunday almost 3 pm and it took just over three -lrb- 3 -rrb- minutes to get two corndogs , large tater tots , and two large fresh fruit slushes . <sssss> service was efficient and young lady was polite too . <sssss> nothing like i had anticipated after reading other reviews . <sssss> so hurray for that . 
4		if you like soda or pop or soda pop or whatever you prefer to call it , now would be a good time to come to my house . <sssss> we have 31 bottles ... or we did , i 've seen my husband with a different drink several times today . <sssss> half the fun is the shopping , the other half the drinking of course . <sssss> do n't believe they have every soda imaginable , however . <sssss> no sun drop -lrb- i 'm not sure they ever stock it anymore -rrb- and no dublin dr. pepper for now . <sssss> but , we did manage to find plenty else to try . <sssss> i wo n't name everything we bought -- partly because you probably do n't care and partly because you need to be surprised when you visit ! <sssss> and with that , i believe i am a little parched . <sssss> i think i hear a sprecher cool & spicy ginger ale calling . 
4		the combo meat sandwich here is amazing ! <sssss> i 'm not a huge fan of bbq so when my husband and nephew , fans of brady from 98 kupd , recommended this place , i was hesitant . <sssss> but since that time we 've come back so many times i 've lost count . <sssss> i do n't eat coleslaw ever , well , until now , the jalapeño coleslaw here is amazing and i get an extra side of it to put on the sandwich . <sssss> the bbq sauce tastes great and the fried pickles are perfect . <sssss> just enough batter to pickle ratio . <sssss> my husband loves the bbq hamburger and the pulled pork is so tender , my 17 month old daughter enjoys it . <sssss> the only complaint i have is that for 3 of us and a baby that eats from the kids menu , the cost is about $ 60 - $ 70 . <sssss> i think they could shave $ 2 off each item and still make good money . <sssss> oh and the peach iced tea made with moonshine is yummy , though for $ 7 you only have 1 . 
4		yes , it 's cougarlicious . <sssss> but i must admit , this is still one of my favorite bars . <sssss> i love that i can use the merc as a bargaining chip to get my scottsdale peeps to come into central phoenix . <sssss> this place is not nearly as pretentious as its scottsdale peers , and i love it for that . <sssss> every server and bartender here is gorgeous , but nice , down to earth - one even offered to take photos of our party ... make sure you bring your night vision goggles as the tableside tea lights do n't help much . <sssss> also cougars and their admirers are definitely on the prowl here . <sssss> drinks are a bit pricey , but the moody , urban lounge ambiance makes up for it . 
4		i really love the food at all the fuegos ! <sssss> we finally had the empanadas as an appetizer for lunch and they are to die for . <sssss> i could really eat their empanadas all day -lrb- which is why there is no picture , it was gone before i thought to take one -rrb- . <sssss> i had the short rib tacos and my friend had the same in a burrito . <sssss> it is some of the best meat i have ever tasted . <sssss> i 'm not sure how they do it but the meat is magically melt in your mouth . <sssss> the chips and salsa are also super delicious . <sssss> my only issue was that the waitress/bartender was a bit abrupt and highly overworked . <sssss> she was niceish when she actually was talking to us but that was a rare occurence . <sssss> there was another girl walking around but i 'm not sure what her function was because she did n't really take any orders . <sssss> she would clear plates and that 's it . <sssss> it 's not a really large restaurant but the way it 's set up makes it difficult for 1 person to handle the bar and the tables . 
4		sunday evening my hubby & i were looking for a place to have dinner & the vig came to mind so off we went . <sssss> it was pretty early , about 5:45 pm , so we beat the dinner crowd . <sssss> we were seated in a comfy booth with a view of their open area patio . <sssss> i know this is such a girl thing to say , but i love their bathroom sinks ! <sssss> for starters we got the crab & artichoke dip . <sssss> it was rich & creamy & just the right amount for 2 people . <sssss> the spiced pita chips that came with were a yummy pairing . <sssss> i also got a cocktail , captain appleseed . <sssss> it smelled just like apple pie but was a bit too strong for my liking . <sssss> for our entrees ; my hubby got the rubin 's cuban sandwich with a mixed green salad & i got the horseradish crusted tilapia that came with a crab stuffed portobello , asparagus , potatoes & a roasted red pepper sauce . <sssss> hubs loved his sandwich & salad , everything tasted extremely fresh . <sssss> i also loved my fish & every single side , i cleaned my plate which means i was hungry & it was delicious ! <sssss> even though i was stuffed , i had to get dessert . <sssss> i got the bread pudding with vanilla ice cream to go . <sssss> we dug in later that night & it was pretty good , big enough for 2-3 people . <sssss> total -lrb- not including tip -rrb- for a cocktail , an app , 2 entrees & dessert was about $ 57 . <sssss> a lil pricey but the food was great so i 'd say it 's worth it ! 
4		my husband took me here for my bday this past w/e . <sssss> we went with a few other people and had a great time ... minus the drink crashing to the dance floor the drunk cousin-in-law let slip ! <sssss> dancing , huge variety of people , everyone laidback . <sssss> i would say definitely a couple place or just a place to kick it with your friends , not to pick up ladies/gents . <sssss> i would have liked to stay here longer but we did n't :-lrb- it was great seeing the couples that knew how to dance ! <sssss> i will definitely be going back . 
4		this is a great place for happy hour ! <sssss> drinks are 1/2 price as are appetizers . <sssss> they are always accommodating of large groups . <sssss> the choices for appetizers can pretty much be a full meal ... even to share ! <sssss> i will never ride the bull but i will always point and laugh at the person riding and then falling off ! 
4		do you know where you are ? <sssss> you 're in the jungle baby . <sssss> you 're gon na die . <sssss> but at least you wo n't die hungry or unhappy . <sssss> the food here is awesome . <sssss> really delicious stuff . <sssss> i ca n't say enough good things about it . <sssss> except for the fact that cafe istanbul is across the effin street . <sssss> and i would n't say i choose one exclusively over the other , but more times than not , it 's istanbul , not constantinople . <sssss> people rave about their hummus . <sssss> which is raveworthy . <sssss> but i 'm all about the babaganoush . <sssss> i think eggplant puree is good clean fun . <sssss> but the name sounds like slang for some big booty . <sssss> and i think i 've just found a new euphemism . <sssss> go me . 
4		great place for a sub . <sssss> i think it is one of the best sub shop franchises going these days . <sssss> the mesa location had great customer service . <sssss> good sub shop . 
4		4 stars for drinks , the setting & the view . <sssss> we did n't stay here , but really enjoyed an evening of drinks at the buttes . <sssss> killer view . 
4		i 've been back to picazzo 's several times since my review last year and i am remiss in updating my review . <sssss> picazzos has been great since my first review . <sssss> the pizza is amazing . <sssss> the pasta is delicious . <sssss> we 've gotten take out and eaten in and all were good experiences . <sssss> tdishes we 've enjoyed include the butternut squash ravioli , the pasta diviolo , the california pizza , and the sweet and sassy ! <sssss> the salads are fresh and are n't overdone . <sssss> he staff is a bit hit or miss hence the 4 star review , but i would say all in all , picazzos is definitely worthy to give a try to some night soon ! 
4		this is somewhat of a small stadium , but very nice for watching basketball . <sssss> it is very clean and modern in its design . <sssss> the view is excellent from anywhere in the stadium . <sssss> there are ample concessions and restrooms located around the concourse . <sssss> just watch out for the idiots throwing things and drunkenly punching each other up in the student section . 
4		loved , loved , loved this place for the food , but really do not like the squishy table seating . <sssss> different , fresh , healthy dining food . <sssss> huge portions . <sssss> i 've been 3 times and ordered the spicy chicken wrap , and the pesto turkey lavosh wrap , and a huge order of the jalapeno cilantro hummus to-go and ate it for the next 4 days at home and it stayed fresh and tasty . <sssss> the wraps are big enough to have a leftover lunch the next day -lrb- or share with someone -rrb- . <sssss> dining alone not so great . <sssss> i was seated at a long table with strangers bumping my elbows . <sssss> it might be chic & trendy , but i prefer to have `` personal space '' when i 'm dining . <sssss> i would not even like this seating if i were dining with friends . <sssss> i ended up walking out , and asked for my order to go . <sssss> not the fault of the waitress - she was still wonderful . <sssss> for the reason of the bad seating , i knocked off one star - i would knock off two , but the food is really great . <sssss> the staff was fast & friendly , optional outdoor seating available -lrb- nice for az winter -rrb- . 
4		the burger here was amazing ! <sssss> i will totally order it again . <sssss> i had a mushroom and swiss one that blew my mind . <sssss> my family enjoyed their meal as well . <sssss> the only thing that was not amazing was the ice tea stand it was really watered down but the food was still totally worth it . 
4		this is a great place to kick back and relax with friends or by yourself , in the downtown area . <sssss> the food and drinks are good , as are the prices . <sssss> in addition to the main dining and bar area , there is a nice patio for -lrb- semi - -rrb- al fresco dining or imbibing , the staff provides efficient and friendly service and - for me a big plus in the summer - there 's covered parking , except during the times when the farmer 's market takes up the covered parking spaces . 
4		only been to this location , but been about 10 times . <sssss> the food is good everytime i go , which is always during dinner time and on the weekend . <sssss> there 's usually no less than 6 of us going at one time , and not once has anyone ever complained that the food was nasty . <sssss> you got your common american dinner stuff here : fried chicken , mashed potatoes , roast , fish , steaks , blah blah blah . <sssss> its a safe place to go when you got people who are hungry but do n't like a lot of fancy foods . <sssss> but you 've still got a really decent amount of choices here , so you wo n't get bored after your first go-round . <sssss> we usually pay like $ 12 or so on the weekends , which includes your drink . <sssss> i think its worth it , as everything tastes good and plus there 's that made-to-order steak grill . <sssss> the place is big , but there 's usually a nice sized crowd here that can make bumping into people occasionally a reality . <sssss> no big deal , just watch that soup ! <sssss> yeah sure , there 's a lot of kids wandering around sometimes ... just do n't step on them and you 'll be fine . <sssss> some people do n't like this kind of atmosphere , but this is a family restaurant . <sssss> i have n't had issues with cleanliness here yet after about 10 visits . <sssss> i have n't seen flies around the deserts ... nor have i been grossed out by the bathrooms . <sssss> freshness issues with food have been pretty much nonexistent aside from your usual piece of fried chicken or whatever that was left in the tray from 2 refills ago . <sssss> you just got ta know how to spot old food ... and that 's at any buffet . <sssss> but not once have i gone and the food has n't been replenished quickly . <sssss> no wait for my fried shrimps !!! <sssss> i usually suggest this place when i know we are all kinda broke but very hungry . <sssss> so that 's why i 'm a fan . <sssss> no 5 stars just because its such typical cuisine , i guess . <sssss> oh , and i 've also had their breakfast bar once ... they had a lot of your good but common morning stuff ... all very fresh and delicious . <sssss> i do n't usually like breakfast bars for some reason , but i pigged out on this one . <sssss> i recommend it ! <sssss> its on sunday morns . 
4		after all the issues we 've had finding food sushi in phoenix , i was worried about beginning to indian food venues . <sssss> luckily , we were much more successful with this type of food . <sssss> the indian delhi palace was absolutely scrumptious , and just as awesome , it was incredibly affordable . <sssss> the samosas were perfectly sized and scrumptious . <sssss> i wish that they 'd brought the tamarind sauce out before them with the chutney , but it did go perfectly with the samosa . <sssss> i got malai kofta . <sssss> not exactly what i was expecting -lrb- it 's my favorite dish -rrb- , as it was a bit different than other places i 've had it , but it was still delicious . <sssss> my partner got a good ol' favorite ; saag paneer . <sssss> it was a bit too spicy for her -lrb- her fault for ordering it medium -rrb- , but we wound up mixing the two sauces together , and it was perfect . <sssss> portions were generous , especially given the affordable prices . <sssss> the service was so-so ; our glasses stayed empty for some time before they got refills . <sssss> i wish i 'd gotten a mango lassi , but it was a bit pricey , and we chose the samosas instead . <sssss> also , i was a bit disappointed that the naan was sold separately , but i guess that 's the way lots of places are going now . <sssss> all told , it was delicious , comforting and satisfying indian food , and we were quite impressed ! <sssss> i ca n't wait to try their lunch buffet . 
4		i was taken here by a friend of mine who lives in phoenix . <sssss> he highly recommended it and after having lunch there , i have to agree . <sssss> i had the steak sandwich -lrb- filet mignon -rrb- done medium -lrb- perfectly cooed -rrb- . <sssss> my soup was minestrone but not done the way i am used to but i still enjoyed it . <sssss> the service was very good . <sssss> my only recommendation is the place needs a makeover . <sssss> it 's quite dated . 
4		harlow 's , you bad girl , you . <sssss> i can taste your huevos rancheros from here ... your fluffy eggs , your sassy salsa , your crispy potatoes . <sssss> all so scrumptious . <sssss> oh , what a temptress you are . <sssss> a deliciously evil temptress . <sssss> leave me alone - i 'm working . <sssss> well , working/yelping . <sssss> ok , just yelping . <sssss> whatever . <sssss> i 'm at work . <sssss> no , i ca n't leave . <sssss> not now . <sssss> i 've got a meeting in ten minutes . <sssss> no , i ca n't reschedule . <sssss> ok , i can . <sssss> but i should n't . <sssss> i really should n't ... aw , screw it - i 'm on my way . 
4		been visiting since 1988 , great food , lunch gyro special is the best ! <sssss> homemade pita , sauce is awesome . <sssss> yes , you will here the family screaming in the kitchen , yes pans and plates crashing but its has been this way since they have opened . <sssss> if going to lunch , go early , same for dinner , all about timing here ! 
4		yeah , yeah the decor is tacky and dated . <sssss> but you do n't come to touch of thai for the sexiness of its appeal , you come here for the food . <sssss> $ 5.95 will get you a complete lunch of red curry , soup , wontons and an eggroll . <sssss> that 's cheaper than kyoto bowl ! <sssss> and yes it 's delicious . <sssss> the aroma of the red curry is intoxicating , the scent of the coconut milk had my mouth watering before i 'd even taken a bite . <sssss> the flavor is rich and just sweet enough , with the perfect amount of spice for my taste -lrb- i ordered mild -rrb- . <sssss> it could have used a few more veggies - there were only 3 green beans in my entire dish . <sssss> not the best thai food i 've ever had , but it was certainly up there . <sssss> i would definitely recommend this place for good service , quality food and cheap eats . 
4		i 'm pretty sure these beans are refried in lard -- this makes my tummy happy , but not my waist . <sssss> good food , super friendly staff , and all day breakfast . <sssss> kind of dive-y and more of a lunch place . <sssss> i wish the chips and salsa were free , but just a minor quibble . 
4		my family loves this place ! <sssss> i like their lamb burger -lrb- which they do n't always serve -rrb- . <sssss> the service has always been great and the food is very good . <sssss> they have nice specials and different flavors of hummus depending on which night you go . <sssss> we are a family of four so we 've never had a problem with seating , but the place is a little small for larger groups . <sssss> we used to live right down the street , but now that we are living in east gilbert , it is definitely worth the drive to get there ! 
4		wow ! <sssss> this jo-anns rocks !!! <sssss> i could n't believe the great stuff you could get ! <sssss> i do n't know if i was there during an extreme sale , but everything was 25-60 % off ! <sssss> i mean scrapbook stuff , baskets , canvases , and a whole lot more ! <sssss> the girls working there were very sweet too ! <sssss> if you like crafts even a little bit , this place will totally suck you in ! 
4		wow ! <sssss> this store is huge ! <sssss> i honestly think it is the biggest dollar tree i have ever been in . <sssss> the store is well lit , well stocked , and for the most part , clean and organized . <sssss> the only downfall is that they only had 1 checkout lane open , which was about 7-8 people deep . <sssss> i felt bad going through with a rather large -lrb- 30 item -rrb- order . 
4		stopped here to try lunch and ... what a great addition to surprise . <sssss> i enjoyed the pork pad thai . <sssss> i went with no heat , but will be more adventurous and get mild heat next time . <sssss> flavorful dish with peanuts and fresh bean sprouts to mix in the noodles . <sssss> the lunch also came with a ginger , seasoned soup and a nice sized egg roll . <sssss> i dropped $ 8 and my lunch guest spent $ 10 on the shrimp pad thai . <sssss> nice sized shrimp came with the dish . <sssss> i plan on trying the soup next , based on bo r 's recommendations . <sssss> also since lunch was great . <sssss> nice mix of flavors and a different lunch treat out in surprise . <sssss> finally not another burger or pizza place . <sssss> try this place out , you will not be disappointed . <sssss> plus its open till 10 pm . 
4		tiny little -lrb- i guess that 's redundant -rrb- bar and grill that seems to have a regular following and serves simple , yet tasty food at a decent price . <sssss> stopped in late one night . <sssss> well maybe it was 9 or so , but that 's late for me . <sssss> i went with the turkey philly spike style -lrb- jalapeño and green chiles -rrb- and potato salad . <sssss> the potato salad -lrb- house-made -rrb- was pretty good , and i 'm extremely hard to please with that . <sssss> the philly was better than i expected considering it was smoked turkey and not ribeye , and the jalapeño and chiles definitely made it better ! <sssss> i ca n't remember the name of the guy working that evening , but he was awesome . <sssss> even though he was tasked with both tending bar and waiting tables , actually one table , he was on top of things and made us feel like regulars . <sssss> in fact , i 'm wondering now why i have n't been back . <sssss> will have to rectify that soon ! 
4		good fast food mexican food . <sssss> clean restaurant . <sssss> drive thru is fast . <sssss> friendly staff . <sssss> decent menu and specials when eating on a budget . 
4		good but not amazing . <sssss> and , not terribly authentic , it seems . <sssss> my exchange-student son said his hong kong-style noodles -lrb- $ 8.95 -rrb- were not like he 'd ever eaten in his home town -lrb- of hong kong -rrb- , but he gobbled them up anyway . <sssss> i though the menu was very diverse and appealing , but very pricey compared to other similar restaurants . 
4		i love decorating my house and now that homegoods has moved into the old borders location -lrb- sniff sniff -rrb- , i frequent this store in hopes of snagging an awesome find at an awesome price . <sssss> while some items might be pricier -lrb- like the wrapping paper -rrb- than other stores , i happened to find a few pieces of my kate spade china pattern at great prices . <sssss> the merchandise offered at homegoods changes frequently , but one can always find accent furniture , lighting , rugs , bedding , wall decor , bath , pet accessories , and kitchen accents . <sssss> the seasonal decor selection is also something impressive to mention that gives hobby lobby a little bit of competition . <sssss> checkout has always been a breeze , which during this holiday time is rare , and hopefully it will stay that way after the season is over . <sssss> homegoods can be hit or miss , but with new shipment every week , there is no excuse to not check it out . <sssss> when you find your `` hit '' you wo n't mind the `` misses '' . 
4		there 's not much more i can say about rula that has n't already been said . <sssss> except , i guess , i can tell you why i like this place . <sssss> i like it for two glorious words : happy + hour . <sssss> yes , those two words matters so much to me . <sssss> rula offers 1/2 off all appetizers and discounts on pints . <sssss> what could be better ? <sssss> i say try the brie , for it comes with an unbelievable apple chutney . <sssss> if you 're looking to split an entree with a friend , opt for the lamb stew - served with a side of soda bread . <sssss> the stew is hearty and the serving is huge . <sssss> i 've also had the shepherd 's pie , which was pretty tasty . <sssss> way too large for one person , though . <sssss> also , i discovered that rula can make ya a raspberry or chocolate guinness . <sssss> i do n't know how either tastes , for i went with a plain -lrb- but satisfying -rrb- pint . <sssss> i asked to sample the concoctions , but was told rula does n't let people sample liquors . <sssss> fair enough . <sssss> if i could change one thing about this place -lrb- ok , maybe more than one thing -rrb- , i 'd have a larger beer selection - even sold by the bottle . <sssss> i 'd also make it less noisy and crowded at night . <sssss> if you do n't get there early enough to stake your spot , you 're likely to be standing the entire time . <sssss> that does n't make for a very comfortable experience . <sssss> word to wise : take advantage of rula 's casual atmosphere and leave your ridiculously high heels at home . <sssss> it 's great that rula offers live music . <sssss> i wish they offered more . <sssss> sure , the outside patio is great , but what if i 'm in the mood to play darts ? <sssss> i guess i 'll have to go to another bar for that ... and for the beer i 'm really craving . <sssss> word to non-meat eaters : try their veggie burger thingy - with mushrooms , peppers and such all heaped between two soft and delicious pieces of bun . <sssss> yum . <sssss> it comes served with fresh , crispy and divine ` tator wedges . <sssss> these ai n't your normal french fries , people . <sssss> i still have cravings for them ! <sssss> rula bula 's food deserves 5 stars ! 
4		stayed here a few weeks ago . <sssss> the rooms are pretty nice . <sssss> it 's a hilton , so i expect the rooms to be decent . <sssss> it 's an older design with the property spread out . <sssss> since the property is large and offers various entrances from the parking lot , i do n't recommend valet parking as it is more convenient to park your car near the entrance to the door closest to your room . <sssss> one of the great things about this hotel is that it has a fleming 's on property . <sssss> we enjoy fleming 's steaks , so that 's always a big plus in our book . <sssss> i highly recommend that friends consider staying here when visiting the scottsdale area . <sssss> it 's located on scottsdale rd , a short distance to old town where all of the eats and fun places are . <sssss> return factor - 89 % 
4		it 's healthy , it 's easy , it 's fast , it 's cheap . <sssss> this is a great lunch spot during the week . <sssss> the staff is extremely friendly , and they will substitute anything and do n't get mad when you want to make 100 modifications -lrb- sorry ... and thanks -rrb- . <sssss> chicken kabobs and white beans are the best thing on the menu in my opinion . <sssss> and that pop machine is legit . 
4		last time i remember going to red lobster . <sssss> . <sssss> humm actually i do n't remember the last time i ate at red lobster . <sssss> wait i do ... it was 8 years ago , after my high school graduation . <sssss> the reason i came to this restaurant was because my lovely credit card company sent me a coupon for $ 10 to be in debt , that 's what i 'm guessing . <sssss> but ya i had this coupon sitting in my dreadful extremely hot room and decided one day `` i 'm hungry and grabbed the paper and went to go eat . '' <sssss> when ever i walk into a restaurant the first thing look for is ; is there a smile on the hosts or hostess face . <sssss> well i just got a partial smile and got seated . <sssss> well i did n't give a crap because just got done fasting and was starving . <sssss> my waitress greeted with a smile . <sssss> a + + very gooodd !! <sssss> i got my usual h20 and ordered a salmon dish with shrimp and other goodies . <sssss> every employee was very attentive to me during the whole meal . <sssss> when my water would be low refill . <sssss> when my bread was gone refill would be right there . <sssss> when my food was eaten my check came promptly . <sssss> even though it was fairly slow and all the employees were messing around . <sssss> the service was absolutely a + + the food was nothing great but everything was all good . <sssss> once another coupon comes from my credit card company for being in debt . <sssss> i shall be more in debt and come eat because food is better than debt . <sssss> can anyone say amen to that ? 
4		this location is just as good as the tempe one . <sssss> i use to go out of my way before i moved tp tempe to eat here . <sssss> it 's that good ! 
4		what do i do ? <sssss> i had a fine experience ... sat at the bar on a wed at 12:30 . <sssss> no wait . <sssss> great service , as others have noted . <sssss> very good sashimi deluxe -lrb- whiteboard special -rrb- two rolls from the luncheon specials . <sssss> price $ 25 plus drinks . <sssss> nothing was bland , everything tasted good and fresh . <sssss> i was ready to give this place a 5 , but too many of you say i 'm wrong . <sssss> i know ... i 'll have to go back again to get a better outlook on sakana . <sssss> in the meantime , maybe i 'll sneak in a few times without reviewing . <sssss> just to keep my tasting skills up . 
4		ask for darrell ... he rocks ... took care of my dad and made him `` looking good '' ... next day too my husband to darrell too ... great fun , great cut . 
4		got the mongolian beef excellent . <sssss> a good place to get some warm supper . 
4		loved this place . <sssss> the service was great , the restaurant was spotless , the food was really great and it was very affordable . <sssss> the pupusa 's were amazing ! <sssss> i also loved their mango iced tea and the desserts were really tasty as well . 
4		ticoz is another favorite place to take out of town folks or people from outside the cenpho area . <sssss> the place has great ambiance , a nice crowd , friendly servers and great original food . <sssss> the drink specials are amazing especially when the mojito 's are on special . <sssss> this is another place where i have yet to have a bad meal . <sssss> one time we brought a friend here and for some reason that particular table has a spotlight that was in his face . <sssss> the place was packed so we made the most of it . <sssss> we offered to switch sides , but he would n't hear of it . <sssss> the portions are good sized and they bring you chips -lrb- not even the best store bought -rrb- and salsa . <sssss> the salsa has three varieties . <sssss> when they first opened they had the best salsa in town with huge stewed tomato chunks . <sssss> now it is good , but ... we like to get different things and share them here . <sssss> one of the things that we often get is the tamale . <sssss> we like it even meatless . <sssss> i have had much better food , but they have a good mix of food , ambiance and service . <sssss> i do n't get here as often as i would like , but it is a regular haunt . 
4		great ambiance and good beers on draft that are reasonably price , which has made me want to like this place . <sssss> went the first time and tried the loaded chips , which were pretty good . <sssss> second time we had cebiche and a fish and chips sandwich , and i thought that they were very basic . <sssss> . <sssss> nothing good about them . <sssss> my friend had some other plate that he did n't think very highly off either . <sssss> i thought of not going back to windsor -lrb- as much as i love that cassette wall -rrb- when i got their email with the free ribs offer during august and decided to try those . <sssss> i finally found what i need to eat when i go there . <sssss> those ribs were delicious ... some of the best i 've ever had . <sssss> the mac and cheese , which i got as a side , was very good as well . <sssss> so , the ambiance and beers make this place good . <sssss> the food , other than the ribs , is not much to write home about ... at least from what we 've tried . 
4		went in tonight to eat dinner at the bar . <sssss> i had a couple of beers - the beer selection is limited , but respectable . <sssss> great considering it 's a wine bar ! <sssss> service was just okay . <sssss> the bartender was helpful enough , but i had to sort of flag him down when i needed something - he never really checked in with me . <sssss> not a dea-lbreaker , but nothing outstanding . <sssss> i ordered the bruchetta -lrb- one each of the apple and brie , prosciutto and fig , burrata and bacon , and warm artichoke -rrb- . <sssss> the bruschetta was incredible . <sssss> i 'd go back just to eat it all again . <sssss> maybe tomorrow . <sssss> parking was open and available when i got there , but it looked like it was exclusively valet starting at about 5pm . 
4		yes , i know whole foods is evil and any real , self respecting hippie would n't be caught dead shopping here . <sssss> luckily , i am only about 3/8 hippie . <sssss> back in portland i would n't shop at wf very often because there are better stores . <sssss> but in chandler there just is n't anything that compares . <sssss> i love the selection , the focus on local products , the produce is always beautiful , and the bulk section is pretty decent . <sssss> they have a huge beer selection , and a pretty good wine selection as well . <sssss> i even did some price comparisons , and i was surprised to find that wf is actually cheaper than sprouts on many items . <sssss> the only thing i wo n't buy here regularly is meat , because the prices are pretty high . <sssss> however , if you are looking for a hard to find cut , you might have better luck here than other stores . <sssss> one way they could greatly improve is if they offered a bulk spice section . <sssss> you really ca n't call yourself a natural grocery store and not have bulk spices . 
4		a recipient of many awards and much praise , i 'm not quite sure what took me so long to visit lulu 's . <sssss> it 's quaint and cute . <sssss> there was spanish music on the radio and a silent syracuse - notre dame college hoops game on the flat screen in the corner . <sssss> it was a nice setting for dinner . <sssss> we ordered beef , a lot of it . <sssss> we got the taco platter - ground beef tacos accompanied with rice and beans and a carne asada burrito . <sssss> i enjoyed it all and immensely . <sssss> the tacos were moist and the shells were crisp . <sssss> the flavor on the rice and beans was just as tasty too . <sssss> the burrito , which i was only allowed to nibble , was also delish - pico de gio , guacamole , beans , cheese and lettuce accompanied the carne . <sssss> it was piping hot and exuded freshness . <sssss> the only negative was that it was a bit greasy . <sssss> it was a bit on the pricey side and there 's a charge for drink refills -- a mere 70 cents , but knowing the way i can woof down a coke along with mexican food had me a bit turned off . <sssss> however , the man behind the counter waived the charge for us which was a pleasant surprise . <sssss> he was friendly and the food was fast . 
4		it 's the quintessential charming dive bar ... sexy guys , cheap drinks , especially on 2-for-1 wednesdays , and easy parking make for a fun combination when you 're just not feeling like putting on the armani . <sssss> you will not stick out in flip flops and cargo shorts here . <sssss> it 's just fun and frat-party-esque for nights you 're just not feelin ' the bouzhy scene . 
4		i was suprised at how good this place was . <sssss> a little bit pricey but well worth it . <sssss> they had a pricer shabu meat but the prime beef was already good enough . <sssss> the japanese miso soup base was so good , udon and veggies tasted great after simmering in the broth . <sssss> they do have boba here which i would advise against getting it , the tea/milk tea itself was very good but the boba was old and hard . 
4		i really love this place , had great experiences each time i took my family here however the last time we went , we didnt get our drinks until about 30 minutes after we ordered but the manager took half off the bill and i like the seats and have no complaints . 
4		my wife suggested switch for brunch on a saturday morning . <sssss> we were quickly seated and beat the late rush , which always starts a meal right . <sssss> we were given good service , good drinks , and good food . <sssss> the restaurant is beautiful and comfortable inside , and has a nice outdoor area as well . <sssss> the ambiance is a little trendy , but it was not a deterrent . <sssss> their brunch specials are exceptional and we left quite happy . <sssss> i had the chef special , a slow cooked pork sandwich , very tasty . <sssss> my wife enjoyed the crepes juevos rancheros , which were delicious . <sssss> we also shared a carafe of screwdriver , which tasted like it had fresh squeezed oj , thumbs up . <sssss> i have been there once before and have never been disappointed in the food or service . <sssss> thank you switch , we will be back . 
4		great shopping . <sssss> some of the stores here ca n't be found elsewhere in the phoenix area . 
4		tried this place out based on all of the good yelp reviews and i was not disappointed ! <sssss> i got a spa pedi with a scrub and callous remover for $ 29 with the 10 % discount for checking in on yelp and it 's still looking good after 2 weeks . <sssss> :-rrb- i will absolutely be back ! 
4		on our way to an a 's game at phoenix municipal stadium , we were on a hunt for breakfast . <sssss> our pre-yelped stops were way off the beaten path and we wanted to get to the stadium somewhat early . <sssss> we found this place in the shopping plaza somewhat nearby . <sssss> we were quite suprised to find that the place was packed !!! <sssss> with a line ! <sssss> and a great smelling bagel smell filling the room . <sssss> we were quite happy to find that there were bagel sandwiches with eggs and there were even wraps . <sssss> we both ordered bagel sandwiches with turkey sausage and egg and cheese . <sssss> we opted for different bagels . <sssss> the bagels were warm soft and fresh . <sssss> soooo yummy !!! <sssss> i would highly recommend . <sssss> the prices are a bit up there if you are looking for just a quickie breakfast , but way better than fast food . <sssss> check it out . 
4		we stopped by for a quick bite . <sssss> it was too late for lunch and dinner was at a friend 's house , so an appetizer for us . <sssss> we chose to eat in the bar so we could watch the end of the suns game -lrb- they lost in double overtime -rrb- . <sssss> our nachos were good and more importantly not soggy . <sssss> the bonus was when we got the bill , we discovered that we had hit during happy hour and our nachos were discounted . 
4		we stopped by this f&e yesterday to pick up something for lunch ... at first glance , i thought i was in love ... but then i looked deeper and realized that there are a few things they could add to make it better . <sssss> you know , kind of like when you are set up on a blind date , you hear great things about this person , you see them and your psyched ... and then they start talking and they 're either dumber than a doornail or completely boring . <sssss> that 's kind of how i felt . <sssss> like kelly said , it 's clean and easy to navigate . <sssss> i love how they have a combination of organic as well as regular name brand items including soda , gum . <sssss> dog food , cleaning products , etc. . <sssss> . <sssss> prices were n't bad compared to other grocery stores either . <sssss> much cheaper than whole foods and aj 's i believe ... my suggestion would be to add a little bit more to the sandwich and salad selection and also to have some kind of ready-to-go tuna and/or chicken salad . <sssss> we settled on hummus and each got a field green salad and a package of pita bread . <sssss> which brings me to the next suggestion - add tables outside for those that want to eat there ! <sssss> other than that , i was impressed ... and the service was wonderful . <sssss> several employees helped us navigate through the store and the friendly fellow who checked us out even gave us a coupon to save $ 5 ! <sssss> we took our purchase to a park nearby and had a picnic ... it was really fresh and we enjoyed our lunch . <sssss> very cute how they stick a little fork and napkin in as well - nice touch . <sssss> we 'll be back for sure ! 
4		the menu for this restaurant is pretty standard greek food , but still really tasty . <sssss> the original gyro is awesome , and they overfilled my pita sandwich with meat . <sssss> yum ! <sssss> they use fresh ingredients each day . <sssss> their hummus was awesome , just a little bit spicy , but not hot . <sssss> the pita was hot , soft and fresh . <sssss> the combo meals come with either fries or a side salad , and both are awesome . <sssss> they season the fries with a little bit of something yummy that i could n't identify . <sssss> as the other folks mentioned , the service at this place is amazing . <sssss> the owner is the sweetest guy , so friendly and helpful , and offered to help me walk my to-go order out to my car , since my hands were full . <sssss> he shook my hand , asked for my name , -lrb- and then called me by my name ! -rrb- <sssss> and invited me to come back . <sssss> you ca n't get more endearing than that . <sssss> i 'll definitely go back to this place again . 
4		girls night was cranked up a notch when we headed to the shop ! <sssss> the tiny bar that is connected to hidden house , a great dive bar , could not offer a better place to dance . <sssss> if you want to hear a great mix of less commercial hip hop and old school in a small intimate setting the shop is for you . 
4		i asked a friend at the arizona republic if i could write a review on the best falafel in town . <sssss> he did n't really seem to like the idea and never got back to me . <sssss> too bad , because i was looking forward to going to all the other middle eastern restaurants in town and comparing their falafel to mebad 's , which is the best i 've had in town so far . <sssss> the falafel at mebad is usually fantastic . <sssss> crispy on the outside , moist and tasty on the inside . <sssss> it 's not overly oily and i 've never had a dry falafel ball . <sssss> and they 're just the right size , about the size of a pinball . <sssss> occasionally i 'll get a batch that is only slightly warmed up instead of freshly cooked , but they 're still quite good . <sssss> the falafel sandwich is fine -- there are four or five balls in a pita with fresh lettuce , tomato and tahini for under $ 5 -lrb- i think -rrb- -- but i prefer the a la carte order , 5 piece falafel with a side of tahini and fresh pita for a couple bucks . <sssss> i usually order that as an appetizer , to share with others or eat myself in addition to a sandwich when i 'm extra hungry . <sssss> other than the falafel , i 'm partial to the chicken gyros sandwich or plate . <sssss> it 's pieces of grilled chicken breast with lots of yummy middle eastern spices -lrb- which i think are still made and sold on premises -rrb- and caramelized onions . <sssss> couple that with tsatziki sauce + fresh pita and you 've got one heck of a meal . <sssss> if you 've got a sweet tooth , try the rice pudding , it 's excellent . <sssss> the baklava and halvah are great , too , but the pudding is the real winner . <sssss> made fresh daily and usually sells out . <sssss> now , if they could only make a dessert out of falafel ... 
4		i 'm definitely a fan of rudy 's . <sssss> anytime i 'm down in chandler i make sure i stop by . <sssss> the baby back ribs & the moist brisket are my favorites with sissy sause . 
4		i finally made it in to the ever popular portillo 's . <sssss> i wanted to go for the opening night uye , but it was just too cold for my thin blood . <sssss> so , i waited to go here for a yelper luncheon . <sssss> i met up with mike c. , georgie m , rand h and marvin a. only girl in the group and that was fine by me ! <sssss> what an amazingly delicious place . <sssss> i left there thinking , i understand the excitement . <sssss> what 's baffling to me is how a place so big can do , at least , one thing so well . <sssss> this was my first time taking a `` dip '' in the portillo 's family of restaurants . <sssss> i 've been to chicago plenty , lived in the burbs for a short while , but never heard of portillo 's . <sssss> no matter , what i lacked in hearing , i made up for in tasting yesterday . <sssss> oh yeah ... this place has been open about 3 or 4 weeks now and the crowd has yet to die down . <sssss> i highly doubt that the crowd will . <sssss> at any rate , i get there just before 11am and you can tell by noon the place would be packed . <sssss> there was a very short line that i hop in to place my order . <sssss> i checked out the menu before i arrive and then i wrote down my order so when it was time to order , i just read off my little piece of paper . <sssss> but , to be honest , i do n't know where their menu is displayed . <sssss> i did try to take a last minute peek to see if i wanted to change my order , but i remember thinking , '' i do n't see the menu , just stick to the script . '' <sssss> i pay and then i wait for my number to be called . <sssss> the place is really really loud , so you definitely need to pay attention for you number to be called . <sssss> i ordered the half sausage/half beef sandwich - dipped baby dipped and with hot and sweet pepper and mozzarella cheese ! <sssss> what a simply delicious sandwich . <sssss> i rarely eat bread , but i wanted to devour the bread . <sssss> the bread was firm , yet soft . <sssss> it has a subtle hint of italian spices that you can definitely taste . <sssss> i highly recommend adding the mozzarella cheese for that reason . <sssss> i wish i had my sandwich double dipped ! <sssss> or more gravy on the side ! <sssss> i did n't enjoy the sausage , and i would never order that again . <sssss> i also ordered the fries . <sssss> this is where i kinda got irritated . <sssss> you ca n't order a salad for less than 5 dollars there . <sssss> i wanted a simple side salad with my sandwich . <sssss> i need a reasonable option to make up for the calorie bomb ! <sssss> but they do n't offer a small salad , so i ordered the fries . <sssss> definitely some of the best tasting fries i 've had in quite sometime . <sssss> the perfect amount of salt with a crisp exterior while hiding the soft warm middle . <sssss> i will definitely go back . <sssss> i hope sooner than later . 
4		nothing better than having a deli right next to work . <sssss> ray and his wife are very personable , always joking with customers , which gives this place a neighborhood feel . <sssss> they also carry local newspapers which you can take for free , as well as draw a majority of the local pd and fd , adding to the local connection . <sssss> the first time i ate here , i have to admit , i was shocked by the quality of the food . <sssss> the hot sandwiches are the best , and stacked with meat so they actually fill you up , as opposed to a subway . <sssss> if you happen to be there on a day when his wife has made a baked good , do n't pass it up . <sssss> her brownies are gooey works of art . 
4		got there at 11am on a sunday , it was packed to the gills . <sssss> wow ! <sssss> i should have listened to michele m . <sssss> we ordered shrimp dumplings , roasted pork , bbq steamed buns , turnip cakes , shrimp egg rolls , chicken feet , spare ribs , steam sticky rice with meats , fried tofu , egg tarts , etc. . <sssss> . <sssss> everything was good . <sssss> this is the best dim sum you can get in phoenix . 
4		annual luau at phillys on the patio !! <sssss> so cool that they do this every year 
4		two words . <sssss> pretzel cone !!! <sssss> seriously people ! <sssss> holy yum ! <sssss> i was on the search for a new ice cream place and am sooo glad i found churn ! <sssss> this is the cutest little shop around . <sssss> the shop itself is kinda hard to find , there isnt much signage -lrb- hint its just north of the circle k. parking is a nightmare . <sssss> they do offer valet as its sister -lrb- or maybe cousin -rrb- restaurant , windsor , is right next door but who gets their car valeted for ice cream ?? <sssss> parking is the only thing from letting this place be a five ! <sssss> the ice cream was creamy and soooo fresh tasting ! <sssss> they have all sorts of tempting treats , i am for sure getting one of those rice krispie treats next time ! <sssss> i hope this little shop is here to stay ! 
4		i 'm a serious amateur photographer . <sssss> their prices seem middle of the road and they keep a lot of the higher end stuff in stock . <sssss> the staff are all knowledgeable and usually fully answer my questions . <sssss> i 've learned a lot there . 
4		i think this is one of the best peter piper pizza locations i have found . <sssss> they are never that busy and are always clean . <sssss> i dont think they have the best pizza around but its great for what it is , a place for kids to play ! 
4		rumbi is a great spot for rice bowls in north scottsdale . <sssss> the place is kind of cute -- the interior is totally decked out hawaiian style , so it 's a welcomed change from the usual lunch routine . <sssss> the rice bowls are pretty good . <sssss> i almost always get the chicken bowls with teriyaki sauce , and i 'm never disappointed . <sssss> in particular , the chicken is really good -- none of that scary brown meat that other rice bowl places have as their standard . <sssss> the only time i had a meh experience was when i got the noodles with the spicy thai peanut sauce . <sssss> the noodles looked and tasted like greasy spaghetti , so i now know better and stay away from that . <sssss> a tip to know is that the bowls come in two sizes , full size and half size . <sssss> the full size is like a buck or two more than the half size , but you 're pretty much paying for more rice . <sssss> the half size is is pretty good portion for most , so stick with that unless you 're uber hungry . 
4		visited this place twice or three times ... ca n't remember . <sssss> i know people find `` fake '' western towns cheesy ... i rather enjoyed it . <sssss> but then again , i go on days that there are no entrance fees . <sssss> the restaurant is average in food , but i enjoyed it . <sssss> love walking around and watching my kids run around the dirt roads . <sssss> it 's a great place for kids , imo ... and if you , as an adult , like western towns ... i 'd at least stop by for pics and a stroll . <sssss> but remember it 's `` fake '' . <sssss> old town tucson is quite nice , if you compare the two ... but i would never pay as much as old town charges again . <sssss> one time solo is enough for this gal . 
4		last time i tried the chicken fried steak it was so-so and i was disappointed . <sssss> so this time , i decided to have the crab cake florentine benedict and that is now my current favorite . <sssss> i love everything about it . <sssss> the cakes never taste fishy , the eggs are poached to perfection and the spinach is cooked perfectly . <sssss> their pan fries are good , old-fashioned pan fries - chunks of boiled potatoes browned perfectly . <sssss> my husband usually has an omelet and they never fail to impress . <sssss> good breakfasts for sure . 
4		i like this place for happy hour . <sssss> the shrimp tostadas are terrific and mini steak tacos are fun . <sssss> the atmosphere is ok and the wait staff is friendly and service is professional and fast . <sssss> great first date place . 
4		lovin ' the new pub ! <sssss> i 've been there three times in the last couple of weeks and have to admit that i 'm hooked . <sssss> where else can you get strongbow on tap , and the pogues , dropkick murphy , the tossers , and flogging molly on the box ?!! <sssss> the food is n't half bad either ! <sssss> they have a phenomenol hh with apps at half off and drink specials that actually make it reasonable . <sssss> my first trip came in at $ 25 for three apps and 4 pints . <sssss> we sampled the wings , some weird little sausage rolls , and the corned beef and cabbage taquitos -lrb- which i must say were quite tasty in a really unexpected way -rrb- . <sssss> the best part was that donelle -lrb- ask for her if you are there -rrb- , lined me up with the second pints 2 minutes before the prices went up to save me a little moola ! <sssss> they have live music three or four nights a week , pub trivia when there is no band and sunday afternoons they do seisiun -lrb- think fraggle rock with irish or celtic instruments -rrb- . <sssss> check out their website for details shows http://www.timfinnegans.com/index.htm this place is comfortable , way not pretentious , and may just be my new home away from home ! <sssss> slainte : -rrb- 
4		flying into town on business , this was my first stop before i even made it to the resort . <sssss> it came highly recommended by a local and it was delicious ! <sssss> i had the chimichanga , adovada , christmas-style . <sssss> i know that probably does n't make any sense , but if you 've read my reviews and you trust my opinion , do it . <sssss> it 's a chimi stuffed with the most amazing meat , topped with both their famous red and green sauces . <sssss> hot and spicy ! <sssss> yum ! <sssss> drinks . <sssss> oh boy . <sssss> big and refreshing . <sssss> i had what the referred to as a `` kick ass '' margarita . <sssss> my bestie had a sangria margarita and another friend had something with `` dog '' in the title . <sssss> it was a frozen margarita with a corona in it . <sssss> i 've been down that road before . <sssss> i decided to stick with the `` kick ass '' margs . <sssss> i had two ... or was it three ? 
4		very nice little place with character near old towne . <sssss> it was busy on a saturday , sat at the bar , and had a little meal . <sssss> mango jicama salad , halibut , and pumpkin bread pudding . <sssss> all very good but the bread pudding was incredible . <sssss> it was funny because the bartender said my name when i sat down and said that such and such was expecting me . <sssss> she gave me a free glass of wine all while i 'm confused . <sssss> she came back and said woops i guess you 're not such n such . <sssss> however , same first name . <sssss> i told her no biggie and that i wanted to pay for the glass because it was n't necessary . <sssss> she was beyond cool and still wanted to buy me the glass but since it was the end of the bottle -lrb- still 3/4 full -rrb- she gave me another full glass right after . <sssss> then after a while a ordered a different red and had that as well . <sssss> man , i was full and happy but had to figure out a way to fit that dessert down my gullet . <sssss> i did , no surprise . <sssss> will be back . 
4		i want to set the scene on this one ... a friend from work and i were bar hopping all over downtown and riding bicycles . <sssss> we had already been to carly 's , lucky strike , roosevelt , bikini , paisley violin , and lost leaf . <sssss> it was a perfectly fine drunken evening . <sssss> riding by district , i said hi to three women smoking on the patio . <sssss> they said hi back , and i thought that was it . <sssss> 1/2 block later , i look back and my friend is not anywhere to be seen . <sssss> he made convo with the three , and scored one of their numbers . <sssss> sweet ! <sssss> well , an hour of talking to them and he had an open invitation for us to join them for chris isakk ... i was n't feeling it though . <sssss> it 's just chris isakk , and i ca n't drive , and the train does n't go there , and a taxi costs too much ... the only option is to bike ! <sssss> it 's almost four miles !! <sssss> so we biked , and biked , and biked . <sssss> finally , after the most awkwardly drunken bike ride down roosevelt for several miles , we arrived to a full parking lot and no idea where to go or how to get in . <sssss> this place has no signage about which entrance is what . <sssss> i go to lock my bike to a fence and the girl at the door says i can not do that here . <sssss> when i asked where i could lock it up , she replied `` sir , i make $ 5.75 an hour . '' <sssss> ok , cool , but where can i lock my bike up ? <sssss> she said i could lock it to a light pole , so i started to do that , then she said `` not that light pole sir . <sssss> i make $ 5.75 an hour please do n't make my job hard . '' <sssss> i do n't care how much you make . <sssss> this we n't on for 10 minutes . <sssss> then trying to get into the place was next to impossible . <sssss> we could n't get close enough to the door to exchange tickets with our contact , and she could n't go out the door because they have a no-reentry policy . <sssss> eventually some young girl with authority told us it was our lucky day and we could both go in for free ... yessssss ! <sssss> my sweet brunette savior . <sssss> inside the venue , everything goes in a circle , and is very intimate . <sssss> there really is n't a bad seat in the house . <sssss> the stage rotates so everyone gets a good view for half the show . <sssss> they have plenty of concession stands , and $ 7 a beer is at least better than chase field , us airways center , or dodge . <sssss> the ride back home consisted of singing chris isakk songs and screaming and yelling all the way down washington back downtown . <sssss> minus the retard at the front door , this is a great place to see a show . 
4		after a thanksgiving of savoring the delicious life , with home brined / baked turkey , honey ham and all the fixings , i had to get something else on black friday while on vacation . <sssss> so i popped open yelp and narrowed down my search to four mediterranean places north of downtown phoenix . <sssss> i randomly picked good fellas grill off n. 19th ave. and w. greenway rd. without regret . <sssss> service was awesome . <sssss> portions , especially for the very well priced lunch specials were adequate and filling . <sssss> the chicken and meats on the kabob dishes were moist and tender , with the moist rice balancing out the spices and seasonings . <sssss> the gyro was delicious , as well as the lentil and potato chicken curry soups that came with . <sssss> why bother having full sized portions when the junior portions suffice ? <sssss> price vs. performance as well as service was exceptional . <sssss> now only if i could find a good combination of such in the s.f. bay area ... i 'm gon na miss the good fellas at good fellas . <sssss> it 's a newcomer to the area -lrb- seven months -rrb- but it definitely does not disappoint , especially for travelers on a budget , looking for a delicious place . <sssss> a place i 'd go back to , the next time i seek nice winter weather in the valley of the sun , as opposed to the dreary s.f. fog . 
4		this place has the greatest hours ! <sssss> the people are nice and helpful with recommending different coffees based on your taste preferences . <sssss> i found this place when i was still a student at asu and it was a great go-to spot if you want to hang out/study with some friends later in the night . <sssss> i 've met people up here and i got to do exactly what i wanted to do : drink coffee and catch up with friends until the wee hours -lrb- conversations can run long-especially whne girls get to talking -rrb- . 
4		this starbucks gets the `` congeniality '' award :d why ? <sssss> * they share a hallway with einstein bagels ! <sssss> 2 of my favs connected :-rrb- other things i like : * plenty of parking * never too large a crowd * friendly staff * police presence -lrb- there always seems to be 1 or 2 vehicles in the parking lot -rrb- areas for improvement : * a bit slow with getting the drinks out . <sssss> * although they ask you for your name , they do n't call it out when your drinks ready , which causes a bit of confusion . 
4		very tasty ! <sssss> we had the dolmades , the flaming saganaki , spanokipita , & gyros platter . <sssss> the bakalava was good , but very cinnamonny . <sssss> would recommend this place to a friend . <sssss> the staff was also very good . 
4		the interior is very modern and clean the menu is a bit small but it seems to have all the basic necessities i am not familiar with the steak n shake business so i ca n't go into much detail on the menu haha the owner/manager of the place is extremely nice and helpful i chose the original double cheeseburger with fries , it was only $ 3.99 also they have those cool freestyle coca cola machines cherry coke for days the burger was made fresh and so were the fries there was great flavor and i really enjoyed it the burger had a unique flavor and i liked it i shall return to the steak n shake next time i 'll try the hot dogs as well as the chili fries 
4		after three visits i am hooked ! <sssss> great little place . <sssss> i tried this place because of a local dines deal and now keep going back . <sssss> two time everything was 100 % perfect . <sssss> this last time the bread on my meatball sub was just a little hard , actually really hard but the meatballs are so good that i overlooked it ! <sssss> i have had the lasagna which was very flavorful and lots of cheese and sauce . <sssss> the appetizers are great as well as the pasta fagiolli . <sssss> the canolli is a great choice for dessert . <sssss> service is always friendly and fast . <sssss> food hot and fresh . <sssss> the place is small but worth the wait . <sssss> the owner was asking everyone how their meals were . <sssss> nice to see him involved and taking care of customers . 
4		just got back from four peaks , i had a good amout of patron , so dont judge if i dont spell things correctly ... anyways , it was good , beer , fabulous , atmosphere great , service ????? <sssss> aahh , once our server finally noticed us , she was great , but when i sit for 5 minutes without anyone looking at us , i get a little annoyed ... over all i will go back , and you should try this spot too !!!!! 
4		1 . <sssss> awesome job in ambiance and location 2 . <sssss> excellent service 3 . <sssss> menu variety this place is a diamond in rough . <sssss> it 's got class and appeals to a variety of appetites , tucked away in the heart of downtown tempe -lrb- party central -rrb- , yet it 's got a private feel or rural-ness . <sssss> it 's a little expensive , however , i 've been known to turn the other cheek with price/value issues , when bribed with good hospitality , a memorable experience , and good coffee :-rrb- the fire place is a nice touch . 
4		this place is dark , divey , cash only , and most importantly walking distance from my house . <sssss> the drinks are cheap , and well made , i agree with the posts about aurora , shes the lady , but all of the bartenders i 've met so far are great . <sssss> there are hand written signs all over the bar , there pool , tiny bathrooms , and when i 'm hungry i can walk over to fry bread house and grab a bite to bring back with me . <sssss> and there a juke box . <sssss> i 'm a sucker for a juke box . 
4		talk about karaoke dive bar , amiright ? <sssss> this scottsdale beauty is the essence of a karaoke dive bar complete with tacky decorations and lonely souls . <sssss> they even have someone who will wait on you ! <sssss> fancy pantsy . <sssss> at no point did i regret the decision of coming here and i would totally return . <sssss> it 's nothing fancy and does it 's job well ! <sssss> i 'm in . 
4		i love costco . <sssss> i think their gas prices are much more reasonable than other places . <sssss> this costco 's parking lot is not a mad house and i always luck out with a really good parking spot . <sssss> i do n't really come here for the samples , i really come here for their quality products and their return policy . <sssss> i do wish that they have more organic products -lrb- veggies and meat -rrb- . <sssss> their prices for organic chicken is better than other grocery stores . <sssss> i do n't use their pharmacy because i find their operating times inconvenient . <sssss> i do n't use their eye care section because they do n't take vision insurance . <sssss> if you 're going to purchase a large ticket item -lrb- i.e. , a tv -rrb- , go to their scottsdale location , the tax is slightly lower . <sssss> overall , i really like this location , i love their products and i am a big fan . 
4		i take my dog to this dog park quite often and the park is large enough so the dogs are n't crowded together , people can throw balls , dogs can run at full speed and there are plenty of poop cans , poop bags , pooper scoopers and places to sit for the humans who hang out while their dogs play . <sssss> one of the reviews mentioned that there were quite a few dogs who liked to hump other dogs . <sssss> unfortunately my dog will occasionally pick out a dog who he feels he needs to show who is boss , but this is fairly rare . <sssss> dogs will do this , not sure if it is a dog park thing , just a dog thing . <sssss> it 's up to the responsible dog parent to curb this behavior . <sssss> i do . <sssss> people are usually very good about cleaning up their pups poop , but there are plenty of us who are willing to grab a pooper scooper , wander the grass and rocks to keep the place clean . <sssss> if you are there sitting while your dog is playing , get off your butt , get some exercise and help keep the place clean . <sssss> also , some dog parents will walk the path around the park and expect their dog -lrb- s -rrb- to stick with them . <sssss> this is a dog park , let your pooch run free and let them play and be a dog . <sssss> let them have one place where you are n't screaming their name and telling them what to do . <sssss> just my opinion . <sssss> :--rrb- there is one chocolate lab who loves to come over and act like he wants you to pet him , then he 'll raise his leg and attempt to pee on you . <sssss> i have actually seen him jump up onto a person and pee on them . <sssss> wtf ? <sssss> i 've never seen the pet parent ever try and stop this behavior , but he/she should . <sssss> if this is your chocolate lab , please try and get him to stop doing this to people . <sssss> gross . 
4		what a gem in downtown ! <sssss> i went with some friends to hang out and see a movie the other night and we were all so impressed . <sssss> this is an awesome way to support independent films and local business while having an enjoyable , interesting night out . <sssss> the tickets are $ 7 or less -lrb- depending on when you go -rrb- and we had some great local beers for $ 4 a piece , which to me , for downtown , is inexpensive . <sssss> the owner was very helpful and friendly and so was the rest of the staff . <sssss> when you walk in it is very swanky but i did n't feel like it was at all pretentious ! <sssss> a great downtown vibe . <sssss> we watched the movie with a few other folks and the director was there to answer questions afterward which was a great bonus ! <sssss> this is a wonderful place for a reasonably priced night out -lrb- but yes , eat first as there are only a few items to hold you over -rrb- and a very unique experience ! <sssss> will definitely be back ! <sssss> only suggestion is to put a bike rack out front for us local people !! <sssss> please ! 
4		eggs benedict with smoked salmon and fingerling potatoes - yes please ! <sssss> this place rocks my world each time i 've been here . <sssss> one of the best bloody mary 's i 've had in the valley - and i drink an obscene amount of bloody mary 's ! <sssss> the vibe in this restaurant is lofty and modern with a bit of local art and an old safe in the women 's restroom . <sssss> there are nooks and crannies throughout the space featuring modern local art and graffiti yet the wooden ballasts and minimal design leave it feeling almost futuristic in design . <sssss> my favorite feature of the st. francis restaurant is the table nestled into a class atrium beside lush leafy landscaping . <sssss> this place is a hit in my opinion with delicious coffee , amazing cocktails , superb food and inviting , hip atmosphere . 
4		let me start by saying i am sure a future review with a 5th star is pending - because this place is fantastic . <sssss> the food is great . <sssss> i have had an appetizer , the timo trio for lunch , and i have had a flatbread pizza . <sssss> nothing disappointed . <sssss> their waitstaff is attentive , they give you more of whatever you need - and do n't hassle you about it . <sssss> i love the new decor -lrb- yes , i said new decor - i frequented this place when it was ... what it used to be . -rrb- <sssss> it has a very urban-classy vibe . <sssss> four stars because ... we went on a pretty slow lunch friday a couple of weeks ago and it took us about 40 minutes to get our food . <sssss> my panini with my timo trio was not great -lrb- sorry , it was n't -rrb- but the rocket greens and the soup more than made up for that . <sssss> i had the tomato soup and i am looking forward to trying the brie . <sssss> however , given that we were on a workday lunch , we would have appreciated faster service . <sssss> the mojito lemonade ! <sssss> it 's fantastic ! <sssss> so fantastic i would pay for two ! <sssss> i get that it 's probably not free refills because i am sure they are not the easiest or most fun thing to make , but i would be more than happy to pay for a second . <sssss> please ask me next time . <sssss> each time i have ordered it i have never been asked if i 'd like a -rrb- a lemonade -lrb- plain -rrb- refill or b -rrb- another mojito lemonade . <sssss> it 's your tab and your tip and all , but i think i 'd go for it if it were me . <sssss> :-rrb- also , i am not sure that this is the case yet , but there does not appear to be a place for any live music . <sssss> even a singer/songwriter guitar player would be awesome . <sssss> it does n't have to be as elaborate as `` it used to be '' - but that was one of the incredible things about this place/location . <sssss> just something to think about . <sssss> so , like i said , i am sure we will be back and back and back and a 5-star review is well in the works . <sssss> ca n't wait to see how this place grows and changes and works out any quirks . 
4		just stopped in after work after reading the positive reviews and had my eyebrows and upper lip done . <sssss> i do n't remember the upper lip hurting so much but none the less it was a good job done ! <sssss> the girl who did my service was very sweet , the owner i 'm assuming . <sssss> i went about 3 o'clock so it was a slow part of the day . <sssss> it was very quiet inside as i was the only customer and they do n't have music playing though i wish they was some background noise . <sssss> as far as the salon it was very clean and smelled nice . <sssss> it was only $ 13 for both services , really good deal . <sssss> i will definitely be back for my eyebrows . 
4		love the concept and my latte was delicious ! <sssss> this coffee house is big , roomy and has lots of great options for your seating of choice . <sssss> i agree that they should list their pricing on their big list of menu items and perhaps offer a little more in the bakery selection , but the coffee is reasonably priced $ 4 latte and the big biscotti was delicious . <sssss> they even have a kids play room which i thought was ingenious ! 
4		i ended up grabbing dinner at havana cafe because my first choice for dinner was closed on sunday . <sssss> even though it was n't my first choice , i 'm glad i ate there . <sssss> when i was looking at the menu , i saw that they still had their holiday menu up . <sssss> i asked the waitress about the availability of the holiday menu and she informed me that the only thing they did n't have on the menu was the thing that i wanted the most - lechon -lrb- suckling pig -rrb- . <sssss> seeing how i was already there , i was debating between the arroz con pollo or the pierna de puerco asada . <sssss> i chose the pierna de pureco asada because it was probably the closest thing to the lechon on the menu . <sssss> now i 'm not an expert on cuban cuisine , but i have enough confidence in my palate to know when something tastes good . <sssss> i thought that the pork was cooked fairly well -lrb- if it was up to me , i 'd like my pork a little on the rare side , but i know that this is not a very popular thing in restaurants -rrb- , it tasted good and there was plenty of food . <sssss> i was surprised that the black beans and rice was as good as it was . <sssss> usually i 'm not a big fan of beans , but i could probably eat these everyday . <sssss> the service was superb . <sssss> our waitress was helpful answering our questions and was very friendly . <sssss> i wish i had more room in my stomach to try more items on the menu . <sssss> i 'd highly recommend this place !! 
4		we have some friends who are long time az residents . <sssss> when we told them we were going to go check out old town scottsdale , they kind of snickered . <sssss> when i questioned why this choice of activity was so amusing , they revealed that ots is a bit of a tourist trap . <sssss> they seem to have forgotten that i have lived an hour and a half from orlando most of my life ... i 'm immune to tourist trap purchase trance . <sssss> what is tourist trap purchase trance you ask ? <sssss> well , it 's when you go to a tourist trap and buy a bunch of useless stuff you do n't need . <sssss> you get home with all your bags of new toys when you finally snap out of the trance and wonder ... what did i just do ? <sssss> oh yeah , we 've all been there . <sssss> i was confident i 'd be okay though . <sssss> we arrived and ots reminded me of a modernized old west town ... with oodles of shops , some restaurants and a candy store . <sssss> i got out of the car and the first thing i saw were the brochure booklets with maps , a directory and ... a dining guide . <sssss> a sure sign of a tourist trap ... the ol' brochure booklet . <sssss> i 'm on to your game old town scottsdale but i 'll play along . <sssss> i took a brochure . <sssss> we walked around peeking inside shops , browsing through a few , but never making eye contact for too long . <sssss> oh no ... never make eye contact for too long or you 're sure to get pulled into a buying frenzy . <sssss> we gave the typical , `` oh just looking '' response to the shop keeper hook question of , can i help you find anything ? <sssss> we were doing great . <sssss> then came the pipe ... i slipped up in a native american-y store . <sssss> i saw this really cool looking pipe . <sssss> it was shaped like an ax . <sssss> i held it and my hand started trembling . <sssss> i had to have it . <sssss> it had feathers on it . <sssss> and it was shaped like an ax . <sssss> it was so cool . <sssss> so i bought a pipe ... shaped like an ax ... with feathers on it . <sssss> i mean , c'mon , how many times in your life will you say that ? <sssss> i do n't even smoke . <sssss> my verdict is that old town scottsdale is pretty sweet . <sssss> although it 's totally a tourist trap , it 's also entertaining and a nice place to come walk around . <sssss> i did n't try any of the restaurants on this trip but look forward to coming back . <sssss> next time with a little more will power . 
4		i 've been here several times that past month because i am literally 2 blocks away . <sssss> as you walk up , the first thing you see is the `` wall of fire '' on the outside patio as linda r. mentions . <sssss> the outside bar is parallel to the inside bar . <sssss> huge windows , with a small inside back bar . <sssss> the build out is super nice and you can tell wasnt cheap . <sssss> the staff is very friendly -lrb- including my favs mick & tiffany @ the bar -rrb- overall it is a nice comfy feel . <sssss> there is often a wait to be seated in the dining area -lrb- of course depending on the time you go for dinner -rrb- , but the bar most of the time is open . <sssss> the food has never let me down so far . <sssss> i 've had salads , calamari , burgers , and filet 's . <sssss> you got ta check it out and decide for yourself , you wont be dissapointed . 
4		first time i went in , i ordered a slice of pizza and then i had this feeling that they had to make a whole new pie for this . <sssss> i was bit annoyed that no one told me this . <sssss> i would think this would be a basic form of communication . <sssss> so once i inquired and realized this , i left because of time constraints . <sssss> i was going to write them off , but did n't . <sssss> i ordered tonight and got an 18 '' pizza for $ 9.95 and ... -lrb- just walked to the fridge to check -rrb- ... i did order a half dozen wings but just realized that i ate about that many and still had some left over . <sssss> nice . <sssss> explains why the total was 20 bucks . <sssss> wings were actually good ! <sssss> to have a place make really good pizza and good wings is a rare find . <sssss> i 'm a wing connoisseur and there 's only one place in bc canada that i could not finish all 12 . <sssss> the cooks actually walked out to see what fool ordered them :-rrb- but this place actually makes them pretty hot -lrb- 911 -rrb- . <sssss> not scorching by any means , but i 'll probably notice tomorrow sometime ;-rrb- that 's always the gold standard test for wings and if they make them hot . <sssss> do you experience them twice ?! 
4		i try to go here once a month or so ... maybe twice . <sssss> it 's great for lunch , it 's never really busy then . <sssss> totally love the jalapeno poppers they make , and the gyoza . <sssss> pretty tasty rolls all around ! <sssss> though , those plates can stack up fast . <sssss> love the iced green tea . <sssss> sure , it 's the same rolls all the time , and it 's not top tier sushi , but it 's on a conveyor , what do you expect ? 
4		this location is a bit of a hike from mi casa , but it 's worth the drive . <sssss> in general , i think sauce is a little pricey for lunch but the price point is perfect for dinner . <sssss> i usually get the thin crust pizza with sausage , pepperoni , onion and peppers and tell them to hold the mushrooms . <sssss> the meatball panini is an excellent choice as well . <sssss> last time my wife got the bruschetta which she thought was fabulous . <sssss> i saw another patron scarfing down the spaghetti and meatballs , so that 's the next item on the menu i 'm going to try . <sssss> i love the casual atmoshere where you can kick back and relax and have a mellow conversation . <sssss> there 's plenty of seating and the parking is plentiful in the evening since the coffee shop next door closes before dinner . 
4		the absolute best thing about this place is i can go here after work because they are open till 2am . <sssss> they are big fans of putting lots of sauce on your rolls . <sssss> so if you order any rolls with sauces expect a lot more than usual . <sssss> the rolls here are wrapped smaller and tighter than most but the rolls are much longer . <sssss> i enjoy this place but really only go here during the late night happy hour . <sssss> because the specialty rolls are about 17-24 bucks and i would much rather pay a third of the cost . <sssss> the only thing i do n't really like is the high price and the slow waitress . <sssss> i cant really say anything bad about the food . 
4		hi chompies ! <sssss> you 're the fantastic ! <sssss> your chorizo con queso is amazing and so is your bakery -lrb- rainbow cookies are bomb -rrb- . <sssss> i love the environment , your helpful staff , and good food ! 
4		with limited jewish deli options to choose from in the valley , chompie 's is at the top of my list when i 'm craving matzah ball soup , potato latkes , bagels , black and white cookies , or quality sandwiches served with plenty of pickles ! <sssss> i 've ordered bagels in bulk from chompie 's before but until this past weekend , i 'd never taken advantage of their catering options . <sssss> i 'm typically a planner , but this year , the jewish holidays came around way too quickly , and i found myself scrambling at the last minute to feed approximately 20 guests at a break-fast on saturday evening . <sssss> i went to the chompie 's website and found their catering menus for the holidays ... i called and ordered a sampler platter for ten -lrb- this came with egg salad , tuna salad , white fish salad , tomatoes , onions , cucumbers , cream cheese -lrb- veggie and regular -rrb- , a small fruit plate , and a chocolate babka ... all of this was conveniently ready for me to pick up saturday at 1pm per my request . <sssss> i added to the order last minute , just to make sure i had enough food , and the folks at chompie 's were fine with that . <sssss> they even helped me carry everything out to my car . <sssss> turns out , we had way too much food ; portions are huge ! <sssss> but everyone left our house with full bellies and many with leftovers for the week . <sssss> i 'm actually kind of bummed that i 'm traveling this week as jared will get to enjoy the leftovers without me ... needless to say , i wo n't hesitate to use chompie 's for catering again in the future ! 
4		accidentally found this place during our az visit -lrb- while looking for mcdonalds -rrb- . <sssss> saw that they have good yelp reviews so hubby and i came down here on our last night of vacay for dinner . <sssss> the menu was pretty large which was good . <sssss> drinks were also served - we had caramel apple cocktail and was very glad to have 'em . <sssss> our server -lrb- forgot his name -rrb- was very nice and helpful . <sssss> made our dining experience really good . <sssss> we had the `` egg roll '' and they were good hubs ordered the mac n cheese -- very rich but otherwise tasty while i had the cajun pasta -- spicy yet good . <sssss> the portion size was really huge price was good too bad i do n't live close by 
4		had a really great lunch here . <sssss> the place was really busy , but service was still pretty fast . <sssss> the food portions are gigantic and you ca n't leave this place hungry . <sssss> prices are in line with the quality and huge portions . <sssss> the fried chicken is excellent , as was the cheese and grits . 
4		dr. charles david , associate director for internal medicine it 's tough for most of us to find a good doc . <sssss> especially if you are new in town or or unhappy with your current physician . <sssss> with this in mind , may i suggest dr. david . <sssss> he 's smart . <sssss> he listens . <sssss> he 's compassionate . <sssss> he wo n't give you unnecessary tests . <sssss> he 's board certified in internal medicine . <sssss> he will help you stay healthy . <sssss> i 've never feel rushed - he is willing to spend as much time with me as i feel necessary . <sssss> it 's a little bit of nuisance to call for an appointment . <sssss> you ca n't just call the office directly but have to go thru banner 's voice mails , prompts/clicks and finally when you get a real person on the phone , it 's answered with a '' ... . <sssss> you have two callers in front of you , please hold '' other than this minor annoyance , once you have an appointment you should have little or no wait while in the reception area . <sssss> i 've found everyone in the office prompt , friendly , efficient , smart . <sssss> go see him , you wo n't be sorry , only healthy and happy . 
4		great food ! <sssss> i 've only been once , but i was happy with the lamb entree . <sssss> the salad the entree comes with was decent -lrb- nothing to write about ... seriously -rrb- . <sssss> however , my brother got the side of fries topped with feta cheese , some paprika and lime . <sssss> delish . <sssss> oh so good . <sssss> also , the drinks come in these huge glasses . <sssss> i mean huge . <sssss> and the service was excellent . <sssss> 5 stars worth . <sssss> only manned by one girl , but she was just so polite , nice and attentive . 
4		the concept of a car wash/boutique/restaurant was completely unique and unexpected as i arrived for a yelp event . <sssss> we dropped off my car , walked inside and were greeted with nice smells , smiling employees and tons of merchandise ! <sssss> we were able to sample a couple brews , wines , food and dessert during our duration , all while getting a free car wash ! <sssss> the food was tasty , i especially liked the brisket tacos and coleslaw . <sssss> the desserts were also very good ... i tried the oreo cupcake and a cookie . <sssss> employees were quick to take your empty plates away and refill your drinks almost instantaneously , 5 star service for sure ! <sssss> as we walked around the market , we noticed kitchy items , wines , car products , beverages galore , clothes , scarves ... the list goes on and on ! <sssss> of course , everything was completely overpriced but that is to be expected in scottsdale . <sssss> the cute coasters i wanted were almost $ 40 for 4 ... yeah right ! <sssss> we did n't catch the demos and after wandering around the store , we walked out to get the car . <sssss> the car was n't there so we walked to the front to ask someone where it was then were told to walk to the back -lrb- again -rrb- to get the car , where were told it was parked in the front . <sssss> that was confusing ... good thing my car was left in a garage type area next to an incredible lambo ! <sssss> keys were left inside my car after the car wash , which made me a little uncomfortable because who knows who could have hopped a wall and drove off with my car . <sssss> we ended up getting gas at another store -lrb- gas here is at least 20 cents more a gallon than most -rrb- and upon further inspection , noticed the car wash was n't very good . <sssss> i noticed lots of white spots on my black car and had to wipe down areas that the attendants should have ... at least it was a free car wash . <sssss> i do n't live anywhere close to here so it was a nice surprise to come here and enjoy a different experience . <sssss> i think this place would do really well out in a rural area or be a great stop on a long road trip for good food and merchandise . <sssss> maybe an idea for expansion ? <sssss> thank you tom 's thumb and yelp for a overall good time . 
4		i recently returned to phx from portland `` bad mexican food '' oregon . <sssss> thank god for la condesa . <sssss> i am lucky to live near by and plan to enjoy their oaxacan black mole tacos on a very regular basis . <sssss> salsa bar is inspired . <sssss> my only complaint -- and perhaps i have n't studied the menu thoroughly -- i 'd like some salad to cut the incredibly rich food . 
4		yum yum yum ! <sssss> great donuts ... service is just ehh . <sssss> the girl who works the counter just seems like she does not want to be there . <sssss> last time i was in she had her cell tucked into her bra having a conversation . <sssss> i thought i was going crazy at first , looking around to see who she was talking to . <sssss> could be 5 points but down to 4 because of service . 
4		fun , engaging classes that really help with form , rhythm , style . <sssss> helpful instructors , especially andrew . <sssss> wonderful private lessons . <sssss> plenty of floor space . <sssss> conveniently located in the middle of everything . <sssss> only complaint : super super high end so expect to pay designer prices . 
4		egg whites and oatmeal and brizza oh my ! <sssss> i 've been hearing about scramble for months now and i finally made it in for a breakfast meeting today . <sssss> i loved it ... the oatmeal was not only the biggest bowl of oatmeal i 've ever seen , it was served piping hot with pecans , raisins , and milk / brown sugar on the side . <sssss> i also had a side of egg whites done just right . <sssss> -lrb- i was trying to be healthy since i recently realized i gained some lbs in the last few months -rrb- . <sssss> however , i did have a few bites of my dining companion 's brizza - it was also delicious ! <sssss> the coffee did the job too ... i left with a nice caffeine buzz and a full tummy too ... the perfect way to start my day ! <sssss> i love the clean , urban feel to this place ... the staff was super friendly and the bathrooms were clean . <sssss> i wish i lived closer to scramble as it would definitely be a regular in my rotation . <sssss> even though it 's a bit of a drive for me , i will be back ... especially to check out their upcoming `` breakfast for dinner '' charity events on wednesday nights . <sssss> -lrb- stay tuned for info on the yelp events calendar -rrb- . <sssss> you 've got a new fan in me , scramble ... see you again soon ! 
4		i 've really liked living in my community for the last year and half . <sssss> i debated on renewing my lease in september , due to a rental increase ; you 'd think with the economy the way it is , they would have kept it the same or lowered it with me renewing but that was n't so much the case . <sssss> to alleviate the mess and hassle of moving , i went ahead and renewed . <sssss> the maintence guy , whom i feel awful for not remembering his name right now has always been prompt to fix anything or service any issues that may have came up -lrb- which are few and far between -rrb- , just an occasional filter change , lights swapped out that i could n't reach , etc. . <sssss> my place was newly upgraded on my move in , so i have stainless steel fridge , flat top stove , cherry cabinets and wood floors in both my bathroom and kitchen . <sssss> i also have a nice fireplace , a roman sized tub as well as a walk in closet that is amazing for all my clothes . <sssss> i really do love the community as it 's super quiet , fairly young overall , clean and the management has always been very nice and helpful . <sssss> just hope they do n't decide to raise the rent again , as it may push me to actually move the 3rd time around . 
4		saturday i had lunch with my girlfriend and her family to celebrate her mom 's bday . <sssss> we had a great meal and the weather was perfect on the patio . <sssss> just like my previous visit i loved the food i had oxtail which was amazing and crab stuffed peppers . <sssss> our server kevin was great and took very good care of us . 
4		garcia 's has been part of the valley for decades . <sssss> it always brings back good family memories . <sssss> the food does n't disappoint . <sssss> i am so glad the moved in this area . <sssss> this was their first week , they had a few opening glitches but they overcame . <sssss> good basic mexican cuisine . <sssss> this location is small , so check the wait time . 
4		good food . <sssss> nice atmsophere . <sssss> we are in our 30s and felt quite young compared to the other patrons . 
4		yay ! <sssss> sephora is finally here !! <sssss> this is the only reason i decided to return to jcpenney . <sssss> i was pleasantly surprised that things have once again been changed to include sales . <sssss> in fact it seems that the whole store seemed back to normal with sales and clearance . <sssss> i may actually start shopping here again . 
4		one of the more dependable chain restaurants . <sssss> it feels like a treat without spending huge amounts for a tasty meal . <sssss> i 've always enjoyed their great food and good portion sizes . <sssss> many items are generous enough to be shared . <sssss> the giant menu allows everyone to find something that they like . <sssss> if you have any room left after your meal you can share a slice of cheesecake or take one to go ! <sssss> we visit both this location and the one at the biltmore often and both are nice . <sssss> even though the restaurant is quite large , there can still be a wait . <sssss> so reservations or call-ahead dining would be a nice addition . <sssss> here are some of my favorites from their menu - it 's always hard to choose just one . <sssss> luau salad http://www.thecheesecakefactory.com/menu/salads/luau_salad grilled shrimp and bacon club sandwich shrimp with angel hair pasta low carb cheesecake is delicious too ! <sssss> they use crushed walnuts instead of graham crackers for the crust . <sssss> i 've rarely ordered something that i did n't love . 
4		i like coming here when i want to pretend to read and then do some grocery shopping . <sssss> i say pretend to read becase , invariably , i start eaves dropping on people seated near me . <sssss> usually these people are either a -rrb- real estate professionals on a lunch meeting or b -rrb- families with small children who are saying ridiculous things . <sssss> i 've also run in to a guy my friend used to date while he is on a date ... that was pretty strange . <sssss> i like their salads , the breakfast sandwhich with feta , and the portobello sanwhich -lrb- on ciabatta , not the recommended bread -rrb- . <sssss> i am in love with the sweet potato sandwhich , but it is huge . <sssss> i recommend ordering a half or sharing it ... even then it is a lot of sandwhich . <sssss> a scone will fill you up for the entire morning and afternoon . <sssss> my mom requests a trip to `` the place next to the cool bookstore '' whenever she comes to town . <sssss> -lrb- p.s. the cool bookstore is changing hands ... and i agree with my mom -- it is very cool . -rrb- 
4		for being a small place , it is great for some plays , as the space get 's to be more intimate . <sssss> no need to worry and fight for a good seat , you 'll get to see the show where ever you are . <sssss> place is new and has many things going on , so if you have time , enjoy ! <sssss> . <sssss> the other plus , that you can take the light rail to get there . <sssss> personally , i do n't go to have a drink to a theater or a coffee , so i ca n't say much of their little bar . 
4		i like the wings . <sssss> the fries are ok too . <sssss> i just want more sauce choices . 
4		this marshall 's truly has everything ... not mention great bargains and great prices . <sssss> this is one of the few i have seen that sell furniture ... paintings ... glass sculptures ... rugs ... and brass pieces for indoors and outdoors . <sssss> they also have patio furniture which i imagine is a big seller out here in az. . <sssss> this store is called `` mega '' for good reason because the store is huge and spacious so you can move around easy and shop . <sssss> however i was very disappointed that they do n't have a good selection of travel bags or laptop bags ... i have seen much better selection at other marshall 's that were not even as large as this one . <sssss> however continue to eat , drink , and be merry my friends !!!! 
4		with the weather being so hot we wanted to have a lighter meal and viet kitchen did n't disappoint . <sssss> i noticed the menu looked different since the last time i was here but i think they offer most of the same things they offered before . <sssss> they did n't have much of a description on the menu for chicken and greens but i thought whatever it is sounded like something i 'd want to try so i did . <sssss> it was n't listed under the salads but it turned out to be a cold salad served with a delicious mound of seasoned sticky rice . <sssss> the salad was very refreshing and just right for a hot day . <sssss> it was made with flavorful infused poached white meat chicken that was ultra moist and very fresh tasting . <sssss> instead of salad greens the greens of this salad seemed to be shaved cucumber and fresh cilantro , it was light refreshing and tasty . <sssss> my husband tried the one soup called hot and spicy . <sssss> he said it was good but very spicy and did n't have all the flavors of pho as it was n't pho . <sssss> the chairs did n't seem as uncomfortable to me as they did last time maybe some are better than others ? <sssss> this is the busiest vietnamese restaurant i 've been too every seat was filled with people and most were asian . <sssss> the atmosphere was loud and busy . <sssss> did n't disappoint . 
4		i 'm a big fan of anything the plus minus studio guys do . <sssss> that includes royal at the market . <sssss> when i heard royal was opening a second location at the new urban grocery -lrb- the first has since closed -rrb- , i was excited to have it just a few blocks away . <sssss> the space does n't disappoint . <sssss> although small , it is an excellent example of urban reuse . <sssss> the wood features are recycled from old flatbed trucks . <sssss> some of plus minus ' beautiful furniture is also on hand , really giving this little cove in the back of the market some character . <sssss> hayes and co. brew strong yet smooth espresso drinks and phoenix 's best iced coffee . <sssss> -lrb- i said it ! <sssss> take that , fair trade ! -rrb- <sssss> the adjacent room is a nice spot to hang out . <sssss> i 'm excited to see what additions they come up with for this room , as i feel it can be a nice co-working spot for some of the downtown coffee faithful . 
4		autozone has been known as a recommended place by diy car guys . <sssss> they usually have everything i want at good prices and i rather come here than a general store . <sssss> as with other auto maintenance shops i 've visited , i need to have patience when checking out as some times the people working there are usually busy helping customer with parts inquiry . <sssss> when i had to do some spark plugs and engine work at night when it is cooler , autozone 's late hours help . <sssss> they have knowledgeable people who can give a good idea how much turn is needed to apply 18 pounds of wrench force , did a free obd tool scan on multiple visit for car 's error code , and can buy specific tool or piece . 
4		i work for the airlines and love barbecue so haps is the `` only '' place . <sssss> honey bears is a joke and quite simply their is no great barbecue in the entire valley . <sssss> period ! <sssss> anyone who thinks otherwise is not very well traveled . <sssss> the four star rating i give haps is based on the arizona `` handicap '' scale . <sssss> their biggest problem is the meat inconsistency , from day to day they can easily slide to 3 ... and lord help me ... 2 arizona stars . <sssss> i do n't know who manages this joint but ... dude ! <sssss> so why am i a regular at haps , well i love barbecue and have learned to navigate the mine fields . <sssss> luckily the sauce is always consistent and if push comes to shove you can always drown the poor beast . <sssss> however on the occasional excellent day , no sauce is required . <sssss> go figure ! <sssss> the most consistent meat is the ribs , the really safe bet is to buy the ribs individually , they tend to use the best center cuts . <sssss> the beans are always excellent and the garlic mashers are the other stand out . <sssss> the rest of the sides are downright embarrassing , in fact the lack of imagination is appalling . <sssss> once again ... dude ! <sssss> haps really needs a proper master smoker who can bring back meat consistency and dream up some edible sides . <sssss> then they would really deserve a proper 4 star rating . <sssss> until then ... it is what it is !!! 
4		great pizza and wings ! <sssss> fast service with reasonable prices . 
4		this community at i-17 and carefree does not have a lot of choices . <sssss> people that live nearby , people going to the lake or bikers riding the loop come here to have a drink , a little bar food or bet on the ponies . <sssss> i had a couple of sliders that were enjoyable and a black and tan in a 16oz cold mug . <sssss> i love the new golden tee golf game , lots of fun . <sssss> the gals are nice . 
4		the food is great here , this is my favor fast food joint ! <sssss> the meat is never frozen and the fries are sliced from the potatoes the get in daily . <sssss> this place is always busy but the burgers and fries taste so much better not to mention healther if a fast food place can be healther the another . <sssss> there 's not 12 different value meals just 3 nice and simple and they have milkshakes that are great too ! 
4		the lovely amber was behind the bar . <sssss> -lrb- great start -rrb- the food much better than expected to be honest , chicken parmesan with pasta , very yummy and good value for money place is stylish modern , yet not too cool as in cold . <sssss> amber alone is worth going . 
4		i really like this salvation army . <sssss> they always have a lot of books and a lot of furniture to choose from . <sssss> they have 50 % off everything on most saturdays and it is pretty well organized . <sssss> i love to browse thrift stores for good finds and i have done well on cookware , dishes and books here . <sssss> one thing that is kind of annoying is the back corner is sometimes a mess because of toys and sporting equipment being thrown all over the floor . <sssss> this makes it difficult to get to some of the book shelves . 
4		if you want to spend time on the internet and have a nice meal this is a great place for it . <sssss> some things on the menu are better than others , but the ambiance is nice and the wifi works well . 
4		yet another trip to the clubhouse has reminded me just how great this place is . <sssss> very diverse crowd , most people would have to try pretty hard not to fit in here . <sssss> the acoustics are great for a divey bar/music venue , and if you are n't digging the opening bands you can head next door to the otb and have a couple cocktails until the headliner comes on . 
4		thank you groupon for finding this little gem ! <sssss> have you ever been interested in glass molding and/or blowing ? <sssss> this is definitely the place to go ! <sssss> these guys make molding glass look so easy . <sssss> they have a ton of classes to make specific things or just entry classes to give it a try . <sssss> definitely something fun to do if you 're up for something new to try . 
4		first key to caffe sarajevo - do n't miss this place . <sssss> it 's located in a very non-descript strip mall with limited seating . <sssss> google map street view this place before coming ! <sssss> second key to caffe sarajevo - the interior decor is adorable . <sssss> i 'm not someone who uses the adjective ` adorable ' often , but i ca n't think of another word that fits . <sssss> it 's like what disney would do if they wanted to design a restaurant for bosnialand . <sssss> third key to caffe sarajevo - and the most important - the food ! <sssss> and it 's delicious ! <sssss> the cevapi seems to be the signature dish - a sandwich of delicious little ground meat sausages filled in a lepinja bread that has kind of a ciabatta-like texture to it . <sssss> however , instead of the crisp crust of ciabatta , it 's more chewy . <sssss> the bread also has a bit more bite . <sssss> i 've tried the small -lrb- with 5 sausages -rrb- and it 's a bit light . <sssss> i 'd recommend at least the medium -lrb- with 10 sausages -rrb- . <sssss> the sandwich is served with a side of chopped red and white onions and a serving of a smooth tomato sauce , served cold with a bit of heat . <sssss> they also offer a few different types of bosnian pitas - which are actually a filled phyllo dough pastry that is baked into a round . <sssss> the zeljanica is crispy , flakey , chewy , gooey , filled with a cheesy spinach . <sssss> very heavy but also very addictive . <sssss> as a baklava fanatic , i had to give their baklava a try . <sssss> no pistachios , walnuts make up the main nut component . <sssss> also , it 's less sweet and there 's a definite savory element to it . <sssss> it 's also not completely drenched and the honey they use is on the thinner side . <sssss> there are fewer phyllo dough layers so it 's less crunchy . <sssss> it 's good , but i 'm not sure if i 'm a fan of this style of baklava . <sssss> got ta try them next time ! <sssss> our server was very friendly and helpful . <sssss> prices were very reasonable for the volume of food . <sssss> the menu is pretty limited , but what they do make is all delicious . <sssss> plus , for bosnian cuisine , which i 'm guessing most people in the united states are n't very familiar with , it makes choosing what to get much simpler . 
4		friendly staff and yummy down home food . <sssss> fun atmosphere - overall a really nice place that makes you feel welcome as soon as you come in - and the staff are really helpful if you want to know more about the area . 
4		excited this place is finally open ! <sssss> the short rib dip was delicious , and the mac and cheese could n't have been better . <sssss> definitely get the mac and cheese . <sssss> atmosphere is just what we need in this neck of the woods . <sssss> the bar could definitely be a nice place for happy hour in the future . <sssss> the service left a lot to be desired , but i 'm hoping that gets better with time . <sssss> overall , great new place ! <sssss> looking forward to going back to try more . 
4		you can always find coupons to this place . <sssss> i already bought groupons here twice this year . <sssss> the atmosphere is super fun . <sssss> the place is kept well . <sssss> they have a fun arcade as well . <sssss> in a town where everything closes at 9pm , this place is as good as it gets . 
4		love this neighborhood spot . <sssss> great place to go to enjoy some good food -lrb- bar foods -rrb- , and drinks . <sssss> they have a wide selection of beers to choose from and are very knowledgeable about them . <sssss> the staff is super friendly and attentive . <sssss> my favorite menu item ... `` the big freaking nachos '' , a delicious twist on nachos . <sssss> made with fried wonton chips , crumbled italian sausage , pepperoni slices , peppers , and melted cheese . <sssss> yum ! <sssss> do n't expect anything fancy in terms of ambiance , it 's a hipster hang out , very eclectic . 
4		the place for lunch . <sssss> i 'm happy whenever i work in scottsdale as that usually means lunch at defalco 's . <sssss> this place is an institution in this part of town and the consistent crowds attest to its reputation . <sssss> the philly cheese steak sandwich is so good that i rarely get up the courage to try something else . 
4		this place is great for a quick , healthy bite to eat . <sssss> i found this place through a 2-for-1 coupon and could not be more pleased . <sssss> i highly recommend the fire-grilled chicken teriyaki bowl . <sssss> very tasty and i love the veggies that come with ... my only complaint is that i swear i have gotten a few frozen veggies in my mix before . <sssss> it 's so hard to say for sure since the portions are so big that my food get cold before i can finish it anyway . <sssss> overall ... very good , fair prices , worth a visit ! 
4		good little hamburger shop . <sssss> guacamole burger was good , person at front counter was friendly , & atmosphere good like chicago . <sssss> had onion rings which had too much batter and not enough onion , but was cooked good and ended up ok . <sssss> overall good for a little hamburger shop , but nothing spectacular . 
4		i stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and it was great . <sssss> the only reason i 'm giving this hotel 4 out of 5 stars is for decor . <sssss> if they had gone just a little above and beyond the average hotel look , it would absolutely be a 5 star . <sssss> upon arrival the bellman pulled all my luggage from the cab and gave me a 30 second intro to the hotel , including pool , internet , and restuarant info . <sssss> i was greeted promptly by the front desk and checked-in . <sssss> my room was great . <sssss> nice big bed , clean bathroom , flat screen tv , but just a plain room . <sssss> no decorative flair , something that i 'd expect in a brand new hotel . <sssss> the gym was fantastic with brand new equipment , weight machines , free weights and mats/balls . <sssss> the pool was beautiful too . <sssss> the restaurant was pretty good . <sssss> while the food was good , nothing memorable and the uniforms that the servers and hosts wear are terrible . <sssss> however , the service was great and everyone was friendly . <sssss> one of my favorite parts of the hotel was the lobby because you can get a drink while you 're hanging out . <sssss> as soon as you sit down , the server would come take your order . <sssss> i held meetings here for three days and the catering , executive meetings , and av staff were absolutely fantastic . <sssss> they made sure everything ran smoothly and were quick to problem solve . <sssss> they are probably one of the best groups that i 've ever worked with . <sssss> my least favorite part about this hotel -lrb- besides the lack of decor -rrb- was their taxi/town car service . <sssss> they only have town cars sitting in their bay , not metered taxis . <sssss> i went to tempe one night to see a friend and the town car driver tried to charge me $ 39 for one way ! <sssss> absurd ! <sssss> the next night , going to the same location , i walked across the street and hailed a regular cab and the same right was $ 29 , still pricey , but more reasonable . <sssss> i 'll be coming back here for another meeting in february . <sssss> i have no doubts that it will be fantastic . 
4		ifind it hard to belive that i have worked around the corner from this place for tthe past two year but have never come inside ... well i have gone two times this week so far ! <sssss> the desserts are truly amazing and so far i have had two turkey subs and e desserts . <sssss> the subs both were a little dry so you have to make sure and tell them to put plenty of condiments on it , unless you like it that way . <sssss> they are all so friendly there , and they have anything you can image italian including pizza dough balls and fresh pasta ready to be cooked . <sssss> while in line to check out i saw that they even sell pasta making machines ! <sssss> if you have n't been here or are thinking of checking it . <sssss> . <sssss> do n't hesitate . <sssss> just go ! <sssss> you will be happy you did : -rrb- 
4		some of the best food comes out of the smallest kitchens . <sssss> this is one of those places . <sssss> family owned and operated , the food it amazing . <sssss> felt like i was back in southern italy . <sssss> do n't let the location scare you . <sssss> what they lack in curb appeal , they more than make up for in the food . <sssss> i ca n't wait to go back !! 
4		all about books & comics ... you , i like . <sssss> your staff is just helpful enough to say `` hey ! '' <sssss> as i 'm walking in the front door -lrb- or the back , as this godless briton often does -rrb- but not so hell bent for sales that i ca n't get to the new comics wall without a short , bushy-haired managerial figure latching himself to my leg and dry-humping with reckless abandon . <sssss> -lrb- see : atomic comics in mesa -rrb- when you walk in the front door , it smells like comic books . <sssss> which is somehow appropriate , because aab&c is one of those no-nonsense-type specialty retailers ... like those stores you see in a strip mall in south phoenix with the simple title of `` guns '' . <sssss> -lrb- what 's next ? <sssss> a restaurant called `` food '' ? <sssss> but i digest . -rrb- <sssss> at first glance , you might wonder what aab&c has that other comic retailers do n't . <sssss> frankly ... as far as buying comics on a week-to-week basis goes ... nothing , really . <sssss> but when it comes to old comics , all about is all alone at the top of the heap . <sssss> you see , i have n't lived in az all my life ... but someone was kind enough to inform me that in the 90 's ... all about was n't just one store . <sssss> they had a bajillion stores spread all across this absurdly large civic pitri dish we call phoenix . <sssss> but when the comic book crash happened in the late 90 's or whatever ... they narrowed down to just one location . <sssss> so all of the old back issues from seven or so stores had to be put into one warehouse . <sssss> which is why if you ask for basically any old comic that is n't action comics # 1 ... they 'll have it . <sssss> the only complaint i can offer is the music selection . <sssss> it 's just so wimpy and non-committal . <sssss> the classic rock station ? <sssss> really ? <sssss> what 's the matter ? <sssss> the easy listening station was n't coming in clearly ? <sssss> what a bunch of girls . <sssss> not that i want to hear hardcore gangsta rap or thrash metal while i buy my x-men comics or anything , but still ... 
4		went for happy hour on a friday evening and it was wonderful . <sssss> rather crowded around 5:30 though this is to be expected and it is wonderful to see a restaurant so crowded . <sssss> very nice ambiance , friendly and helpful wait staff -lrb- even when i did my best to get a recipe out of them to no avail this was all taken in stride so i figure they must hear this quite a bit -rrb- and the food ? <sssss> delicious ! <sssss> i ca n't say that i have had a crab cake appetizer with so much crab meat in it and without excessive breading and just the right blend of spices to make each bite sing . <sssss> the sauce was a perfect balance to the crab cake itself . <sssss> the calamari appetizer was delicious , everything was fresh and again so balanced . <sssss> a delight . <sssss> very nice wine list , i played it safe and went with the kim crawford . <sssss> i would * definitely * go back ! <sssss> there truly did seem to be some kind of a time warp going on in there though because time just flew by though i personally did n't mind one bit . <sssss> i highly recommend eddie v 's ! 
4		sa bai ! <sssss> have a drink ! <sssss> i do n't know if i used it in proper context , but hey i 'm telling the story ! <sssss> well during my visit to the auto mechanic , had to wait for my car so i decided to take a stroll . <sssss> lone and behold i ran into this delightful place . <sssss> they even explain what sa bai means right on their sign . <sssss> i decided from there i needed to eat lunch plus i love thai food . <sssss> came in and i was greeted with a smile and i knew -- oh yeah ... this is gon na be good . <sssss> i sat at the bar , but it was tad bit early for a drink -lrb- plus i had too much last night -rrb- i always order the fried rice noodles at thai restaurants -- i believe this makes or breaks a thai joint -- stir fried rice noodles w / chicken . <sssss> it came out so quick i thought i was at mcthai-food ! <sssss> though i know it was freshly made since it was steaming and the veggies were so colorful . <sssss> result = smile on my face and a happy belly -- burp ! <sssss> sa bai indeed ! <sssss> as for the ambience -lrb- sa bai dude ! -rrb- <sssss> -- it was definitely a fast food restaurant before , but they did well with their decors - lots of sunlight with a bombay look . <sssss> let 's just say i walked back to the auto mechanic forgetting about why i was there in the first place . <sssss> - enjoy ! 
4		i 've only been here once , as i just moved to scottsdale , but the low carb breakfast was delicious . <sssss> i 'll definitely be back to try more . <sssss> the only reason i did n't give it 5 stars is because i have n't tried most of their food . <sssss> definitely casual . 
4		the perfect traditional breakfast ! <sssss> lots of other varieties , going to have to return and try them all . <sssss> very friendly and not afraid to say ... merry christmas ! <sssss> love them ! 
4		my hubby loves this place ! <sssss> we just moved into the area and were looking for a close breakfast place . <sssss> the food it good -lrb- not 100 % to my liking but that 's just my taste buds -rrb- . <sssss> the staff is very friendly and they have a few tables outside for when the weather is nice . <sssss> inside is a large , high-ceiling one-room restaurant . <sssss> it 's clean and consistent . <sssss> again , do n't let my taste buds defer you from trying this place out . 
4		i was referred to gerber collision & glass by geico . <sssss> i was driving to work on the 60 during a windy day , and a large piece of foamboard flew up and knocked off my driver 's side-view mirror . <sssss> gerber replaced the mirror , with matching paint-color and car-model within one day . <sssss> they were great and would do business with them again . 
4		i love the thin crust classic signature . <sssss> so does my mom . <sssss> my husband thinks the sauce is too sweet ... but his opinion does n't really count . <sssss> i tried the antipasto with the house italian . <sssss> pretty decent salad for a pizza joint ! <sssss> we ordered online and picked it up ... i am always a fan of not having to call and place an order . <sssss> i have an aversion to talking on the phone . <sssss> i have no idea why . 
4		wow we just visited this cute little place . <sssss> very nice and cute little bundt cakes , we were looking for some cupcakes for a friend , but thought these might be better for a change . <sssss> very cute little shop with helpful people working there . <sssss> we had the white chocolate raspberry , lemon , and marble just to name a few . <sssss> they were n't cheap but they were so worth it -lrb- please see pictures -rrb- . <sssss> the frosting they use is incredible by the way , if you are in need of a special treat or gift , this is for you ! <sssss> they also make specialty bundt cakes for birthdays and special occasions i believe . <sssss> their so cute , please do n't hurt them ! <sssss> * please note that they are in their own containers and that keeps them so so moist . 
4		last time we were in gilbert we stopped in for lunch . <sssss> wow , we could n't believe the long line . <sssss> we decided to still give it a try . <sssss> forty-five minutes later we were seated at our table enjoying our lunch . <sssss> my husband ordered their special hamburger made for the chinese new year . <sssss> it was a fantastic blend of asian flavors and the burger itself was super moist and tender . <sssss> he was a huge fan ! <sssss> i also had a few bites and i was as well . <sssss> i ordered the steak sandwich which was also very good , but not as good as his burger . <sssss> we also ordered the sweet potato salad and loved it . <sssss> it was the best i have ever had . <sssss> great place to eat but go early or late to beat the huge crowds . <sssss> also great indoor and patio seating . 
4		u get 10 % off when u spend more than $ 25 ... woohoo ! 
4		so much better than roscoes . <sssss> better waffles and certainly better chicken , ca n't go wrong with a nice jug of kool-aid either . 
4		today was my third visit ! <sssss> i only learned about the place a little over a year ago -lrb- i moved into the area during the first quarter of 2011 -rrb- , but i only paid my first visit last week ! <sssss> i 've concentrated on just one trail , pushing myself to go further -lrb- and quicker -rrb- each time , and i still have n't finished the complete lap . <sssss> it 's a great workout , and today i learned that the further you go into a specific trail , the rougher the path gets . <sssss> great views , clean air , and a great workout each and every time . <sssss> if you have n't visited msp , you must rectify this immediately ! <sssss> : -rrb- 
4		enjoy it here and regularly get good service . <sssss> have enjoyed a large variety of menu items over the years . <sssss> great meal for after a long day at the pool . 
4		good food , nice place , extremely small ! <sssss> the food was terrific and home-made & just-made , but with enough of a twist in recipes and presentation that you it 's worth it . <sssss> the coffee is relish , too . <sssss> heading to use the restroom will take you through the kitchen and that was immaculately clean . 
4		i love this place for happy hour . <sssss> amazing prices and oyster 's that are the best i have ever had in az ! <sssss> i go super early with my hubby and have referred others there as well . <sssss> great professional staff and love how open it is . 
4		i got a priceline room rate at $ 45 and stayed 3 nights . <sssss> the room was comfy for 1 and well appointed . <sssss> i had everything i needed and the choice of pools . <sssss> if the pool had people at it i just went to the next one until i found a vacancy and had the place to myself . <sssss> very relaxing . 
4		there 's just something about this bar that made me love it from the second i stepped foot inside . <sssss> maybe it 's because it is a glimpse of what downtown phoenix could be : a hot spot for the night life scene . <sssss> cityscape offers a very real potential for revival of social activity in the heart of the city , and copper blues is off to a good start ! <sssss> my wife and i went on a saturday night . <sssss> we live right down the street , so we had to see if it was worth adding to our list of hangouts . <sssss> the vibe was very casual , hip and festive . <sssss> they offer around 50 beers on tap , some delicious small plates -lrb- and some larger ones -rrb- , and live entertainment ! <sssss> that night we tried the filet bites , paired perfectly with a creamy horseradish sauce , and knocked back a few beers while enjoying a band playing some great covers ! <sssss> the prices were a bit higher than surrounding local bars , but it was well worth it to enjoy a more upbeat night in a nice setting ! 
4		the service is great . <sssss> i like . <sssss> the bathroom was not quite up to par and that is the only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars . <sssss> otherwise , it was a fun place for drinks and sinfully delicious pub food . 
4		i 've come here for lunch on and off for the past few months i 've been working at my new job . <sssss> this place is n't half bad , and its just like any other wendys i 've been to . <sssss> lunch hour is busy in the resturant and the drive through , so come prepared and expect some delays when ordering . <sssss> they also serve breakfast here , and i 've never had a bad experience yet ! <sssss> in and out in no time ! 
4		went here for the `` little puffs of heaven '' and the `` chocolate wheeler '' as mentioned by other yelpers , found an old fashioned chocolate covered donut that looked like a wheel but the girl behind the counter said they did n't really have names . <sssss> these are definitely good donuts and almost ate all 12 donuts in one sitting just to make sure . <sssss> did n't get the little donuts this time but figured i 'd be back . 
4		also known as wallace and/or gilbert town center cinema , this theater is often much less crowded than surrounding options -- even on opening weekends . <sssss> clean and cool . <sssss> the service is typical of minimum wage workers and the ambiance uninspired . <sssss> still , it 's refreshing not to have to park miles away or fight hordes of pre-teens just to see a saturday night flick . 
4		i 've always enjoyed this place when i 'm down in tempe on mill . <sssss> once i found out it was pat tillman 's favorite hangout when he was in school at asu it just added to the greatness . 
4		the sweet potato fries are excellent and the burgers are huge . <sssss> i tried the delux burger and was nit disappointed but could have easily split it with someone . 
4		mmmmm ice cream sandwich . <sssss> this dessert is really great because it 's really two desserts . <sssss> i like that ... a lot . <sssss> so i went here this afternoon for ` dinner ' and got the vietnamese coffee ice cream between two chocolate chip cookies ... so good . <sssss> it was a little salty and sweet and coffee - y. . <sssss> . <sssss> what more could i ask for . <sssss> the bf got peanut butter ice cream with snickerdoodles ... also very very tasty . <sssss> the thing is , the ice cream was n't blow your mind awesome and the flavors were pretty ho hum ... i would definitely come back here if i were in the neighborhood , but i probably would n't make a special trip again . 
4		potbelly 's makes a tasty little sandwich for $ 4.80 , and an even better one for $ 5.00 . <sssss> i was here today with some friends for their pre - grand opening slated for tomorrow . <sssss> a suggested donation of $ 5.00 went to scottsdale christian academy baseball team -lrb- see photo -rrb- . <sssss> after giving my donation , i won a free shake on their spinning wheel . <sssss> all the places were food items . <sssss> potbelly is a yummy midwest sandwich place that has live music in all of their shops . <sssss> the older locations have tall ceiling where a banjo , or guitar player sits on the top of the booth area while playing away . <sssss> this location has a guitar playing in the corner on the right as you come in . <sssss> very cool . <sssss> as for the food , potbelly is known primarily for their their wreck sub which is $ 5.00 . <sssss> it 's made with salami , roast beef , turkey and ham along with swiss cheese . <sssss> they also have two similar subs called : `` italian '' with capicola , mortadella , pepperoni , salami with provolone cheese , also $ 5.00 ; and a `` pizza sandwich '' which has many of the above cold cuts but with marinara sauce . <sssss> i 've had both before and they are good too . <sssss> those are their three upscale sandwiches for $ 5.00 , but their regular ones for $ 4.80 are equally good . <sssss> i particularly like the roast beef -lrb- which i had today , see photo -rrb- , but the turkey breast , smoked ham , meatball are all delicious . <sssss> i 've been told by jim their jv manager , that their 30 % larger sandwiches , called `` bigs '' , will be rolled out later in the year . <sssss> nice . <sssss> you also need to try their hand-dipped shakes and smoothies . <sssss> delicious ! <sssss> enjoy ! 
4		it is unusual for me to arrange an event at a location i have never been to but on the advice of a friend i threw caution to the wind and was glad i did . <sssss> the staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable about their wines . <sssss> they were able to connect the guests with the wines they were likely to enjoy just by asking a few questions , something some wine bars are not able to do . <sssss> i had the prosciutto and arugula pizza which was just fantastic , their crust was not too thick and not too thin which was perfect for this former new yorker . <sssss> i went back a few weeks later and enjoyed the rondelle four cheese , which is pasta sheets rolled with mozzarella , fontina , blue cheese , parmesan and spinach and baked in tomato sauce , absolute heaven . <sssss> my friend had the chicken parm which is basic but their sauce is so good you do n't notice that its something as simple as chicken parm . <sssss> also try the farmers pasta , you ca n't go wrong with sausage , chicken and fire roasted peppers . <sssss> i will absolutely be back ! 
4		teriyaki chicken bowl is good . <sssss> i like kyoto bowl 's better but that 's just personal preference on the taste of the sauce . 
4		love the resort and we got a great table looking out at the beautiful landscape & pool area . <sssss> we went for mother 's day weekend - saturday . <sssss> i was told when i made the reservation that they had a brunch buffet on saturday . <sssss> turned out they had cancelled that . <sssss> had an 11:00 reservation and was given breakfast menus , by the time we ordered though they told us breakfast was over but they would accommodate our order ... . <sssss> somehow the communication broke down but we had a perfectly prepared , delicious breakfast with great service and a beautiful view ! 
4		we go take out from here during a spring break visit . <sssss> love that they had a good veggie burrito -- not just a burrito without the meat , but a legitimate burrito for a vegetarian . <sssss> fish tacos were good and worth negotiating over the last one in the box . 
4		great local bar and grill . <sssss> family run . <sssss> great value . <sssss> want to grab a beer and just kick back with friends , go here . <sssss> street and dirt bike friendly as well . <sssss> stuck behind autozone , so do n't miss it . 
4		had lunch here and i had chicken sandwich which was great , my sister had the short ribs with the most amazing bbq sauce made with dr. pepper . <sssss> delicious ! <sssss> good selection of wine and a great spot , too bad it was too hot to sit outside but patio looked great too . <sssss> did i mention they have an old school ice cream parlor setup in there as well ? <sssss> yum ! <sssss> even if you are not staying at the hotel i 'd definitely check this place out . <sssss> great views ! 
4		i 'm not a home decor or kitchen aficionado , but whenever i need something for the house that i want to be a step up from target -lrb- or ca n't find there -rrb- , i can always find it at bed bath & beyond . <sssss> the store is big , and has nearly anything you can think of . <sssss> if you actually look hard enough , you can even find some random stuff that you would never expect to find . <sssss> prices are very competitive . <sssss> not typically the lowest unless there 's a sale , but there 's always a deal to be found . <sssss> the staff is also very helpful . <sssss> i was once there to buy some place mats and matching napkins for my table . <sssss> they were one napkin short , and the cashier dug through several boxes in the back to find them . <sssss> while that 's something i know a good store employee should do , i know that it 's just as easy to lie and say they 're out -lrb- bed bath & beyond does n't strike me as commission based -rrb- . <sssss> for me , the big score is k-cups for my keurig coffee maker . <sssss> bed bath & beyond has the best selection i 've seen at any store . <sssss> and only charges $ 9.00 for an 18-pack -lrb- about a buck less than most places sale prices -rrb- . <sssss> it 's not a store that 's really in my range of interest . <sssss> but for those of you who love home accessories , this is a great place for you . 
4		i like switch a lot more than my husband , but oh well he can write his own review . <sssss> :-rrb- . <sssss> we have been here a few times -lrb- would be more if he enjoyed it more -rrb- . <sssss> i really like the decor inside and little back patio . <sssss> maybe it 's the wine lover in me that has this place on my list of likes -lrb- damn , is it 5 ` oclock yet ?! -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> they have a great happy hour . <sssss> happy hour wine specials make me feel so warm and fuzzy inside . <sssss> the wine list is extensive and they have appetizers that nicely pair with the wines . <sssss> i have always enjoyed the food here as well . <sssss> the menu is diverse and there is pretty much something for everyone . <sssss> i like curling up on the front couches and talking , relaxing , and enjoying the lighting , candles and people watching . <sssss> i would love switch -lrb- and so would my spouse -rrb- if the service was better . <sssss> the last time we came they said `` it just got really busy , so we can seat you , but no one will be with you for about 20 minutes '' . <sssss> well ... okay . <sssss> i appreciate the honesty i guess . <sssss> so we ask if we can grab a drink then , and are told `` no , it 's too backed up at the bar , too '' . <sssss> well now you have made us pretty upset , because i love my wine and do n't appreciate being denied that drink i have been waiting all day for ! <sssss> so since then we have not been back , which is too bad . <sssss> i think if you catch it on a slower day you will really enjoy yourself . <sssss> stick to happy hour , too . <sssss> slightly overpriced for what you get otherwise . 
4		amazing happy hour specials . <sssss> we can get 2 pitchers of beer and eat all the food we want for about $ 20 on a saturday afternoon . <sssss> how can you beat that !? <sssss> the food is simple and good , the staff is fast and friendly , and the patio is delightful . 
4		delux is an upscale burger joint located on camelback rd. . <sssss> the food was pretty high quality and i enjoyed my lunch there . <sssss> if you go there you have to get the sweet potato fries . <sssss> it is an absolute requirement . <sssss> they are open late making them a great option instead of a fast food drive through . <sssss> they also have a large variety of beer on tap which is a nice plus . 
4		this place had a really good vibe , the outdoor patio was a great place to have some drinks , apps and chat with friends . <sssss> it seemed like a place where folks were start off the night with some really good drinks and some nibbles , then stumble down the street to one of the clubs to go all out . <sssss> there was a rocket-something on the menu that was really good , the artichoke dip was yummie as was the tuna tartar . <sssss> the ribs and calamari were ok . <sssss> . <sssss> i would stay away from them . <sssss> drinks were also made well , just not with heavy sf hands that i 'm use to . <sssss> : -rrb- 
4		done dates here . <sssss> taken kids here . <sssss> got into a fender bender here when my wet foot -lrb- dang bumper boats -rrb- slipped off of my brake while wearing my no-traction shoes . <sssss> yea , that 's just mentioned as a warning to the drivers - do n't wait until the end to do the bumper boats . <sssss> even if it is getting a little chilly . <sssss> or at least go dry your feet first . <sssss> anyhow ... it 's a great place for dates , kids or just acting like kids with a bunch of friends . <sssss> we really like the mini-golf . <sssss> it 's a decent course and there usually is n't too much of a crowd in the evenings . <sssss> on a weekend afternoon though - watch out . <sssss> even in the heat folks will be out here on a regular basis . <sssss> absolute top though has to be the go karts . <sssss> no bumping is allowed - which kind of makes sense on this track as you actually go fairly fast . <sssss> while most of the cars are in good condition , at least someone in your group will normally complain that they had a bad car stating that is the only reason they were n't wiping the floor with all of us . <sssss> whatever . <sssss> my go kart driving skills could kick their go kart driving skills any day . <sssss> well , unless i had a big meal , or it was hot , or got a bad car ... 
4		pretty cool store . <sssss> i was on my way to the gym this weekend -lrb- are n't i always -rrb- , and figured i needed some new clothes . <sssss> when i walked in , i was a bit concerned because it looked like a women 's clothing store . <sssss> it was n't apparent that men 's clothing even existed . <sssss> i carefully walked towards the back of the store and found the men 's section only to be greeted by a gigantic sale rack ! <sssss> it was amazing . <sssss> i picked up three pairs of jeans , and a killer cardigan for 65 bucks . <sssss> everything fit perfect . <sssss> the girl who managed the fitting rooms was super friendly and absolutely adorable . <sssss> and the chick who checked me out -lrb- at the cash register , you pervs -rrb- , was prompt and neatly folded everything like it was respectable . <sssss> kudos urban . <sssss> kudos . 
4		this place is great . <sssss> you order at the counter and they bring your food out . <sssss> there is a nice big dining area and seating is almost always available . <sssss> i have had the honey-cured ham & brie frittata for breakfast and they are generous with the brie , i 've also tried the banana walnut pancakes that were delicious . <sssss> for lunch their grilled cheese and blt rock . <sssss> dinner i have tried all the pasta but the butternut squash ravioli -lrb- butternut squash ravioli topped with roasted walnut cream sauce and nutmeg -rrb- is my favorite . <sssss> they also have excellent ice tea and lemonaid and tons of pastries and sweets . <sssss> this is a great place to go for a quick , fresh , sit down meal . 
4		i had to chime in on my mother 's . <sssss> i have been going to this place for years and it has always been one of my favorite places for comfort food in the valley . <sssss> i have to let everyone out there reading some of the other reviews that they serve canned foods , is utterly ridiculous ! <sssss> i know for a fact they make everything from fresh ingredients and make their gravy like mom or grandma did . <sssss> i 'd like someone to bring me some canned gravy that has the flavor and consistency that it does here ! <sssss> now that i 'm done ranting , you must try the turkey dinner ! <sssss> it is the bomb ! <sssss> make sure you get the cranberry sauce with it . <sssss> meatloaf , prime rib , lasagne , are some of my families favs . <sssss> the only reason i do n't give them 5 stars is the fact that they need to bring in a nicer table wine . <sssss> other than that leave the decor alone , it really is old phoenix . <sssss> pie ... ... you 'll love any of them , whatever you are in the mood for , it will bring a smile to your face ! <sssss> yum ! 
4		i am new to the area , but i think this used to be j. chew , based on conversations that i overheard and a little bit of research on yelp . <sssss> i really liked my first experience here , largely because of the friendly atmosphere that renee , the bartender , creates . <sssss> granted , she is helped by the size of the bar . <sssss> it is small , but that is its charm . <sssss> one can enter , sit , and get to know the others at the bar within moments . <sssss> it makes for that neighborhood bar `` where everybody knows your name '' kind of feel . <sssss> a turnoff for me was when i asked what type of bar or what entertainment , if any , was going to be offered . <sssss> i was told , `` i am not certain we know yet . '' <sssss> in my opinion , if you are already open and serving customers , it is too late . <sssss> but who knows what can happen ? <sssss> the place definitely has potential ! 
4		excellent italian . <sssss> i would strongly suggest tomaso 's to anyone looking for authentic italian in phoenix . <sssss> this place is in the biltmore area in the same strip mall -lrb- strip mall in phoenix ? <sssss> shocking ! -rrb- <sssss> as sportsman and tarbell 's which leads to my only complaint -- parking . <sssss> there is a free valet -lrb- tip them you cheapskates -rrb- so that problem is partially mitigated . <sssss> this place is a real throw back . <sssss> the waiters are all pro 's and have thick italian accents . <sssss> the garlic butter offered with bread is out of this world so even though it 's green and strange looking , enjoy it . <sssss> i was craving simple spaghetti and meatballs -- it 's not on the menu but they 'll do it for you if you ask nicely . <sssss> coupled with a few morettis -lrb- decent italian beer -rrb- it was a great experience . <sssss> one place i recommend with confidence and will return to at the earliest opportunity . 
4		go on a weeknight . <sssss> it is less crowded and the kitchen is not as busy as it is during the weekends . <sssss> also get there around dusk . <sssss> hopefully , you will take a ride down the sliding board on the way to your table that provides a great sunset and evening view of the valley . <sssss> i have always enjoyed the steaks here and the prime rib is very good as well . <sssss> service is always friendly and fairly fast . <sssss> when in season you can get rattlesnake bites as an appetizer , but i prefer the fired mushrooms . <sssss> lways enjoyed the steaks here and the prime rib is very good as well . <sssss> service is always friendly and fairly fast . <sssss> it is a western casual restaurant and is fun place to go for a good steak . 
4		good place , dark , tons of tvs and great food , i like to sit in the restaurant area because it has more to view , and the bar area seems to be full of d-bags but that 's just me . <sssss> but since it is close to home it 's always up there on places to go when you want a quick drink or some bar food . 
4		i 'm craving a tinga taco just writing this review . <sssss> i love cien agaves ' tacos ! <sssss> you can order them individually , as part of a meal with beans and rice , or a platter of 10 for $ 35 . <sssss> pork , carne asada , chicken , potato , lobster . <sssss> . <sssss> you name it , they have it . <sssss> whether you like mild or spicy , are not a meat eater , whatever ... you 'll find the perfect taco for you . <sssss> their patio is basically a narrow walkway with wobbly tables . <sssss> that 's the only negative here in my book . 
4		i love the concept . <sssss> healthy food with a trendy flare . <sssss> a cool , hip staff and an incredible buildout make this place a pleasure to eat at . <sssss> i 've never had a bad experience with the staff . <sssss> the food is good , the soup is amazing . <sssss> my only quibble : how can you market yourself as a place that makes `` true food '' and sell farmed salmon ? 
4		chips were hot & fresh ... very hot ! <sssss> the food was wonderful . <sssss> our order was somewhat lost in translation . <sssss> our sever asked us again if that is what we wanted . <sssss> i said yes . <sssss> we got enough food for 4 people . <sssss> we got the plates of tacos rather than 2 individual tacos ! <sssss> these plates include beans and rice of course . <sssss> i did not even dig in to my chimichanga , as i was so full of chips & salsa , and my tacos of course . <sssss> the décor is very simple , and the seating/booths are very basic . <sssss> you are not going here for the local ambiance ; you are going to come here for the yummy mexican food ! <sssss> i will go back ! 
4		ultrastar cinema is a fun experience when you feel like splurging . <sssss> i went and saw a movie in the star class theaters , and had a good time . <sssss> pros : -- big comfy seats with big armrests -- great decor -- serves beer and wine -- friendly staff -- popcorn . <sssss> can i just say , omg ... they have cheddar , caramel , and kettlecorn popcorn . <sssss> tip - get the cheddar and caramel mix together . <sssss> it 's delicious . <sssss> cons : -- portion size on food . <sssss> we definitely went all out on the food and ordered the quesadilla -lrb- $ 7 - $ 9 -rrb- , hummus -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- , and nachos -lrb- $ 7-9 -rrb- . <sssss> for the prices , they definitely skimp on the portion size . <sssss> -- taste was bland . <sssss> the food was very mediocre unfortunately and did n't have a lot of flavor . <sssss> -- no tray space or place to put your food . <sssss> the biggest design flaw at this theater is , there 's no tray for holding your food . <sssss> so you 're stuck playing this game ... where am i putting the food ? <sssss> armrest ? <sssss> floor ? <sssss> lap ? <sssss> kind of annoying when you feel like stretching out in your seat . <sssss> maybe a consideration for the theater ... when people get food , leave a tray on a trayjack somewhere so there 's extra room for plates . <sssss> -- beer is priced at $ 7.25 a glass . <sssss> when you 're paying that much for a blue moon , you 're expecting a normal size glass . <sssss> nope , you get a small glass of beer . <sssss> my recommendation , stick with the wine as the size is normal . <sssss> -- halfway through our 7pm movie , our waiter dropped the check off and gave us last call . <sssss> hmmm a bit early ? <sssss> overall i like the concept of ultrastar . <sssss> i 'll definitely be returning ... but i 'm not willing to pay for the food or beer . <sssss> i 'll just stick to the popcorn and wine . 
4		i was definitely confused upon entry , as this was my first time at any which wich . <sssss> it 's a little overwhelming with all the choices but i really like the brown bag where you select all your own toppings . <sssss> there 's just enough options without being too many to read through and the process is efficient . <sssss> plus your wich is toasty and warm in your hands just a few minutes later . <sssss> the highlight is , amidst the chaos of westgate , when you do n't want to sit down for a meal with waitstaff , or wait 2 + hours in line for a table when the game starts in 2 hours , and you do n't want bad stadium food , this is the perfect option . <sssss> it 's fast , it 's easy , it 's good . <sssss> in fact , i 'd return for a wich at another location . 
4		had dinner w / family last night . <sssss> miso soup was very good . <sssss> the seaweed salad & the sushi rolls were very fresh & tasty . <sssss> service was very friendly but a bit slow , because there was only 1 waitress . <sssss> she was running ragged serving all the tables . <sssss> i understand the reason for only 1 waitress . <sssss> helped out by being patient . <sssss> definitely a recommend and will be back . <sssss> will try other dishes next visit . <sssss> : - -rrb- 
4		decided to stop by for breakfast by myself one sunday morning . <sssss> the reviews on yelp were enticing , so i gave it a shot . <sssss> i ordered the sonora potato and sausage hash -lrb- eggs , potatoes , hot links , chipotle , garlic , onions , peppers -rrb- w/side of sourdough toast , $ 8 . <sssss> http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/neyread5gzd3rieza-irpw?select=tkow6uy1opaah4wfxlkfpg i could n't wait to take a bite of my dish as i love hot links and have never seen it in a breakfast item before ... it did n't disappoint , it was very good . <sssss> the hot link was actually spicy , which is often not the case . <sssss> the potatoes were very tasty as well . <sssss> my only complaint was that it was kind of a small portion ... i was left wanting more . <sssss> my server was very friendly and welcoming . <sssss> she asked how i found the joint and addressed me by name when i left ... very cool . <sssss> return factor - 98 % 
4		time to update my review of this place . <sssss> besides the awesome steaks they have here , this is a great spot for happy hour . <sssss> we meet friends and associates here often for happy hour . <sssss> they have this awesome `` 5 for $ 6 'til 7 '' happy hour menu : 5 wines , 5 cocktails , 5 appetizers , 2 entrees , or 2 blue moons for $ 6 ea ... that 's an amazing deal ! <sssss> we enjoy the wines of course and some of the appetizers we get are the roasted pork belly , carpaccio , and mushroom ravioli . <sssss> our fav entree is the prime burger w/cheese & bacon ... it 's a huge burger for only $ 6 . <sssss> this is a great spot for dinner or happy hour , check it out if you can . <sssss> best part is we love to get the gift cards from costco ... $ 80 for $ 100 worth of cards ... that saves us an additional 20 % . <sssss> return factor - 100 % 
4		you know the soup nazi episode of seinfeld ? <sssss> i like to keep that in mind when i do my yelp reviews because , while the rating system is a simple one to five stars , you really are n't reviewing all restaurants on the same variables . <sssss> diamond 's needs to be rated amongst authentic discount chinese food restaurants . <sssss> i give it four stars with the understanding that diamond 's is not : - romantic - a place to meet my girlfriend 's parents for the first time - charming is it authentic ? <sssss> maybe . <sssss> how would i know ? <sssss> i can say that it 's a value where you get a lot of good for an inexpensive price . <sssss> the decor is n't impressive but they do n't claim it is . <sssss> specials are written on florescent poster board lining the restaurant . <sssss> service is slow and inconsistent though -- so less a star . <sssss> but i stand firm that , if you like chinese food and you are hungry , then this is the place to go . 
4		the strip mall exterior belies the treasure within ! <sssss> when you enter , you 're immediately greeted by the smell of cooked meat . <sssss> normally the smell of meat is not a pleasant one for me . <sssss> as in , makes me lose my appetite . <sssss> so , it 's a huge compliment when i say , the smells coming out of the open kitchen are mouthwatering . <sssss> when one of my dining companions received her short ribs , there were yet more mouthwatering aromas . <sssss> wth kind of alchemy is going on in that kitchen make this vegetarian salivate over dead animal ? <sssss> no matter , fellow lovers of the plant plate , there 's options for you here . <sssss> for starters , you * must * order the brussels sprouts -lrb- they do come with panchetta , but it can be left off -rrb- . <sssss> dievine . <sssss> seriously . <sssss> as are the roasted root vegetables . <sssss> i love when something simple is so delicious . <sssss> i normally never eat mac and cheese because it 's so two-note -lrb- duh -rrb- , but beckett 's table makes it so that i finally * get * why people are all gaga over this stuff . <sssss> it 's very subtle , but those mustard seeds take the dish to a whole other level of delish bliss . <sssss> my entree , the oven roasted vegetable tower was probably the least exciting thing i ate last night night , but still flavorful in its own right and beautifully plated . <sssss> i 'm just not a fan of roasted peppers and onions which comprise about half of the stack . <sssss> i 'll leave this tiny meh at that , because the entire experience blows that away into the ether . <sssss> next up , dessert . <sssss> although thoroughly stuffed at this point , i managed a bite of the sweet potato pie -lrb- incredible -rrb- , the berry cobbler -lrb- delightfully tart , balanced with a sweet ice cream -rrb- and the piéce de resistance , fig -lrb- yes , i said fig -rrb- and pecan pie . <sssss> i 'd be remiss to not mention the cocktail list , which seemed quite creative . <sssss> it was hard for me to choose , but i had the az farmhand , which has hendricks gin , soda , ginger , lemonade and honey , many of my favorite cocktail ingredients . <sssss> it did not disappoint . <sssss> fabulous selection of wines by the glass , too . <sssss> a thoroughly lovely experience from start to finish , beckett 's table provides top notch food at affordable prices , with impeccable service in a rustic environment -lrb- you feel like you 're in the hippest , coziest lodge -rrb- . 
4		customer service can occasionally leave a little to be desired but usually everyone is wonderful . <sssss> i find the best times to go is when there is a great sale , so stay tuned for coupons and ads because you can really save a bunch . <sssss> fabric department is generally pretty knowledgeable and able to help with questions . 
4		i think breadfruit is a wonderful little jamaican restaraunt . <sssss> the dishes are unique and wondefully flavorful . <sssss> the place is small , but that just adds to the air of intimacy . <sssss> the kitchen is close and within view . <sssss> the wait staff is extremely knowledgable , friendly and ready with a great and candid assesment of what 's `` great '' on the menu that day and what 's not . <sssss> the cocunut/carrot juice drinks are absolutely amazing . <sssss> i think this spot is best as an off-downtown lunch spot as it can get pretty crowed -lrb- and hence uncomfortable -rrb- during week-end evenings . <sssss> i definitely give it an enthusiastic recommendation and am certain you will love the food ! 
4		even in the middle of so called `` autumn '' , phoenix tends to get a tad warm in the middle of the afternoon . <sssss> so , during my latest afternoon motorcycle jaunt , the temperature got to me , and , being a mere mortal , i knew it was time for some refreshment . <sssss> now , being that i was on my bike , i could n't really consult the almighty yelp . <sssss> so , i just rode around for a little while . <sssss> as i was approaching the desert ridge mall , i took a fortunate right hand turn that landed me at yumberi yogurt . <sssss> as far as concept goes , this place is just like the other foyo places all over the valley . <sssss> it 's a self-serve facility -lrb- which makes me chuckle when people complain about the service at these types of places ... but i digress -rrb- , where you pick your flavor , pick your toppings , weight it , and then enjoy . <sssss> there are at least 16 different flavors at any given time . <sssss> each flavor is written in chalk on its own little chalkboard http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yumberi-yogurt-phoenix#0z5xmsp_h54bpslgykcmha . <sssss> personally , i think it adds a nice little personal touch to the place . <sssss> plus , it 's functional , in that it affords the shop the opportunity to change out the flavors whenever they want . <sssss> today , i opted for the sugar free cheesecake ... not a lot , just enough to tide me over for a while . <sssss> when i was trying to figure out what toppings i should get . <sssss> everything looked great . <sssss> the cookie dough , the sprinkles , the different fruity cereals , you get the idea . <sssss> but , what really stood out for me -lrb- and i 'm glad they did -rrb- were the blueberries and the kiwis http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yumberi-yogurt-phoenix#rk9fnr23tdtwcemeojuvfw . <sssss> i know that might not sound like a delicious pairing , but it worked out very well for me . <sssss> both fruits just exploded with each bite ... especially the blueberries ! <sssss> they just `` popped '' every time i bit into one . <sssss> living in phoenix , you expect places to have decent outdoor seating ... well , at least during this time of year . <sssss> the weather is just perfect . <sssss> well , yumberi certainly does n't disappoint . <sssss> their patio is a nice long area down the side of their building , completely covered with small awnings http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yumberi-yogurt-phoenix#ibafaleoby3ztmegqbcsha . <sssss> that , and the seats are super comfortable . <sssss> they 're over-sized chairs that just swallow you up when you sit in them . <sssss> it definitely made for a nice respite from the late afternoon sun . <sssss> as with most places of its kind , yumberi does offer a frequent shopper card . <sssss> so , if you happen to buy 10 , the 11th one is free . <sssss> also , they run their own in-house specials , like family night -lrb- tuesdays -rrb- and happy hour -lrb- wednesdays -rrb- http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yumberi-yogurt-phoenix#tjjma-zyj_fboqp0shs8-q . <sssss> i know everybody 's palate is different . <sssss> so , feel free to take my rating with a grain of salt . <sssss> i know i enjoyed it , and i hope you will , too ! 
4		this place is fantastic ! <sssss> customer service was great and the prices are very reasonable . <sssss> we kinda wandered our way into the chinese cultural center on a lazy sunday afternoon , i needed to pick up a couple of things from the market , and have been craving some genuinely delicious chinese food -lrb- i was experiencing bad nerves exacerbated by systemic and repeated bouts of disappointment with my takeout and delivery options -rrb- ... anywho ... we got allllllll sorts of kerfluffled and twitterpated when we saw they had a dim sum section on the menu ... not very many dim sum options , but all of them sounded pretty good to me -lrb- plus it was the first time i actually saw a dim sum menu , usually i just see folks wandering around with carts of unknown treasures and delights ... no carts on the day we went there though -rrb- . <sssss> the menu itself is gigantic , huge , colossal -lrb- ok , not in a cheesecake factory way , but definitely more than you 'll find at a hole-in-the-wall quick order-by-numbers place -lrb- ie # 1 w / chicken and # 27 w / shrimp -rrb- -rrb- ... and is broken down into americanized and non . <sssss> i love that . <sssss> it gives me an opportunity to get something that i 'm familiar with and try some more risque items that i ca n't get from panda express . <sssss> ;-rrb- so here 's the dish : *** wonton in spicy & sour sauce -lrb- dim sum -rrb- - heavenly **** dumpling in chili sauce -lrb- dim sum -rrb- - even better than the wontons ** dan dan noodle -lrb- dim sum -rrb- - it was ok , but the other two were way better ***** sauteed green bean - phenomenal and second only to ... ***** yuxiang eggplant -lrb- this was so good that if someone told me i had to eat this eggplant and those green beans every day for the rest of my life , i would thank them ... and maybe offer my eternal gratitude -rrb- . <sssss> all of that came to about $ 30 , we were stuffed and had leftovers for my lunch the next day . <sssss> also , i went to their website -lrb- just now -rrb- and it looks like you can order takeout -lrb- phoenix -rrb- or takeout and delivery -lrb- chandler -rrb- from them online . <sssss> solid !!! 
4		its great to go here with my daughter ... i love the dine in experience and having a glass of wine while i endure hours of disney movies ... i dont understand the office chairs ... i often feel like i am at a corporate conference and not a luxury theater 
4		i 'd been craving cuban food ever since i left florida , and i could n't have been more thrilled after our meal at havana cafe . <sssss> i would n't sit inside , as the atmosphere kind of sucks , but the patio was great in the recently-awesome weather . <sssss> the service was great ... the waiter knew the menu inside and out , had great recommendations , and was the guy who remembers your order without a pad and somehow does n't screw it up . <sssss> sangria-delicious mojitos-same seviche -lrb- spelled that way -rrb- - ditto gambas y pollo-see above pumpkin soup -lrb- seasonal -rrb- - best i 've had the bad - i think they are pretty over-priced for cuban food . <sssss> do n't get me wrong , the food is great , but i do n't think cuban food should fall in the $ 20/plate range . <sssss> you need a key to get into the restrooms , which makes it feel kind of like a gas station . <sssss> you also get a feel that most male customers just go behind the dumpsters , not that i did that ... this place would have been an easy 5-stars except for one thing , that totally blew the experience . <sssss> the waiter automatically added a 20 % tip to the bill , on top of tax . <sssss> ordinarily he would have earned it . <sssss> but when questioned , he said they always do that on large parties . <sssss> we were a party of 5 . <sssss> he was extremely arrogant about it , saying nobody 's ever questioned it . <sssss> totally ruined the whole evening . <sssss> and of course , there was no mention of an auto-tip on the menu , go figure . <sssss> i could understand if there were 10 of us , you get it . <sssss> overall , i would be excited to go back again . <sssss> it 's a great place to go if you are craving some pretty good authentic food in the valley that is n't mexican . <sssss> grab a $ 28 pitcher of sangria and/or a few mojitos , splurge on some appetizers , and go for just about anything on the menu . <sssss> nobody in our group left disappointed , with the food at least . 
4		okay , so it is hard to find mexican food in tempe that is like what i have with family in mexico . <sssss> every time i 'm craving some plain frijolles de la olla -lrb- beans , whole -rrb- i go here . <sssss> i keep coming back for the burro clare . <sssss> do n't come expecting some fancy restaurant but it 's great for a yummy lunch . <sssss> one thing is that their salsa is kind of lacking and a side of guac will cost you your first born , but other than that everything i 've had is delicious , including their margaritas . <sssss> once we went and i met once of my favorite artists , crystal castles , hanging out having some margaritas before their show at the marquee ! <sssss> i figure this is probably a rarity as usually the place is pretty empty . <sssss> the service is awesome , the girls there are so nice and helpful . 
4		i 'm not a red meat eater , but my best friend was in town and was craving a steak . <sssss> i had no idea where to take her . <sssss> another friend suggested this place because it was close and she had only been here for drinks . <sssss> we decided to be adventurous and give it a shot . <sssss> the friend who suggested the place decided to meet us . <sssss> we were seated immediately and although i was a little disappointed that we were seated in the hallway , next to the kitchen door and across from two other tables that we had to face because our table was horseshoe shaped , the seats were far back enough that the kitchen door did n't bother me . <sssss> i was still a little conscientious of the other two tables with people staring at us though . <sssss> strike one ... horrible table . <sssss> get it out of there . <sssss> strike one was redeemed with a fabulous waiter . <sssss> he was attentive , and we never had empty glasses or plates once we ordered . <sssss> we received bread , appetizers , salads , entrees and refills with no hitch . <sssss> i was n't impressed with the appetizer , but it was n't their fault . <sssss> i just ca n't see myself ever having shrimp with cheese ever again . <sssss> i thought it was weird when i ordered it , but was curious . <sssss> curiosity satisfied . <sssss> we received our salads and entrees and dug in . <sssss> my friend 's steak was cooked to her liking and loved her seafood with it . <sssss> she said everything was what she was craving and expecting . <sssss> coming from her , that 's a huge complement . <sssss> my other friend was equally happy with her slab of meat . <sssss> my entree was the chicken oscar , which has shrimp and scallops on top in a bearnaise sauce . <sssss> took one bite of the scallops and shrimp ... oh my . <sssss> yummmmm . <sssss> scallops were cooked perfectly . <sssss> i love scallops that melt in your mouth . <sssss> the vegetables were cooked perfectly . <sssss> still crispy , not over-cooked . <sssss> then i get to the chicken and this is where strike two happens . <sssss> the chicken was so salty that i could n't even finish the second bite . <sssss> luckily , i was full from the veggies , scallops and shrimp and mashed potatoes i ate . <sssss> when the waiter asked if he could take my plate and i said yes , he asked if there was something wrong with the chicken . <sssss> so , being honest , i told him . <sssss> at this point , i 'm full , fat , dumb and happy so i declined his offer to replace it with something else . <sssss> then here 's where they redeemed themselves on strike two . <sssss> even though i told him it was unnecessary , the manager came over and apologized to all three of us . <sssss> he looked at me and said he comped my salad and entree and then offered all three of us desserts and coffees on the house . <sssss> he explained the saltiness comes from the rub the cooks use and he 's asked them before not to use so much . <sssss> i barely heard this because i was still astounded that not only is my entire meal free , but now desserts for all three of us too ? <sssss> and coffee ? <sssss> who am i to turn down free coffee ??? <sssss> then the manager asked me something i love to hear : do you have any allergies ? <sssss> why yes i do ! <sssss> nuts ! <sssss> he explained that i should not get these certain desserts and offered me all the nut free options . <sssss> i asked him if i could marry him . <sssss> it 's been too long since someone in a restaurant asked me this before i could say something . <sssss> i would go back for another dinner . <sssss> i know how to modify my meal to my satisfaction now . <sssss> i would also recommend this place to my friends and family . 
4		this place is great ! <sssss> i went here for lunch and the food was delicious . <sssss> it was kind of empty though , which was a shame . <sssss> it should be more popular ! <sssss> but i enjoyed the quiet . <sssss> i 've also gotten food from 5 r cha thai go and it 's great . <sssss> i 'm only giving this location four stars because i have only gone one and would like to try it again . 
4		great place for breakfast ! <sssss> this has become my family 's new sunday morning tradition . <sssss> green chile omelette is amazing . 
4		was looking for chinese buffet , and siri led us here -lrb- not a chinese buffet -rrb- . <sssss> we stayed anyway and were not disappointed . <sssss> they have outstanding food - and good chinese food is hard to come by . <sssss> we will definitely go back ! 
4		welcome to houston 's with a happy hillstone hat on ! <sssss> one thing that always bothered me about the former houston 's was how dark and dreary it could be , but that is definitely not the case with hillstone . <sssss> i absolutely love the architecture , location and openness of this building . <sssss> it 's fresh and airy with plenty of large windows , an open patio , and rock finishing . <sssss> the restaurant seating is n't cramped and you 've got plenty of room to relax and enjoy the meal with those you came with and not 20 other strangers . <sssss> before i got to hillstone , i read up on the yelp reviews and noticed kat s 's note about the ice cubes . <sssss> so , when i sat down and ordered my diet coke , the first thing i glanced at were the ice cubes and kat 's right ! <sssss> they are old fashioned and pretty great ! <sssss> they are the type of ice cubes they place in whiskey to make sure they do n't crush when they are dropped in , but i also think they make the soda pour without fizzing up . <sssss> so now i will move on to the meal . <sssss> the reviews are right in saying that this is exactly like the houston 's menu but with a nice improvement . <sssss> i ordered the rotisserie chicken sandwich with the couscous . <sssss> warning : the sandwich is huge and way too big for one lunch , but that could be a good thing if you want to have the other half for lunch . <sssss> we did n't have dessert but i glanced at the menu and while they have several of the houston 's signatures , i think they should add apple crisp to the list . <sssss> i will definitely be back to hillstone and think this is a nice addition to the area . 
4		lemon zest ? <sssss> on a pizza ? <sssss> yeah , i was n't sure if i was going to like it . <sssss> i decided to put my faith in lgo to create a wonderful pizza experience . <sssss> and that they did ! <sssss> my final verdict ; the avocado pizza is heavenly ! <sssss> the creamy avocado , sweet tomatoes , summery basil , bright lemon zest , and add in the salty prosciutto and you have yourself a pretty tasty pizza . <sssss> the best part is that you do n't see that kind of pizza on the menu everywhere you go . <sssss> the even better part is the sourdough crust !! <sssss> so delicious ! <sssss> all of their pizza creations sound amazing . <sssss> i ca n't wait to try them all ! <sssss> a few more tries and i easily see a fifth star in their future . <sssss> it did take us a few minutes to figure out the lunch flow of the place . <sssss> - order your food on the grocery side , - find your own table on the pizzeria side , - wait for your sandwich on the grocery side , - listen for your pizza on the pizzeria side , - ask for more ice at the coffee stand , - fill your ice tea at the table at the doorway between the two - go back to the grocery side to pick your dessert from the case -lrb- trust me , you do not want to skip this step ! -rrb- <sssss> in addition to the wonderful pizza and the lunch with great friends , lgo also provided a bright spot in my day by putting one of my favorite -lrb- hard-to-find -rrb- red wines right by the cashier for $ 10 less than i usually get it at aj 's . <sssss> score !! 
4		usually i cut my own wood , but middle of last winter i found myself in a pinch running out of wood and having no time to cut more . <sssss> went to berry bros and purchased a cord of mesquite . <sssss> apparently they get it from hyder az. . <sssss> it 's good , dry mesquite and has burned well , and i still have some leftover for this winter . <sssss> many of the pieces are very large , and since it 's mesquite , you would need a very big fire to get some of these pieces to burn . <sssss> i used my axe -lrb- and even my maul a couple times -rrb- to split the pieces into smaller burnable ones . <sssss> my only gripe would be that most of the pieces of their mesquite are not cut at even angles on the ends , so they will not stand up on their own when you set them down vertically to split . <sssss> i needed to use a wedge the majority of the time so the logs would stand up on their own again this is a small gripe , but for what i spent i would like the wood to have even 90 degree angles on each side to facilitate easier splitting . <sssss> i will be back again if i find myself running out of wood this winter . 
4		my reaction to potbelly is always `` so small , '' followed swiftly by `` so good ! '' <sssss> if you 're looking for a direct subway substitute , potbelly will come across as pricey . <sssss> if you 're looking for an alternative to chi-chi $ 8 - $ 10 sandwiches , potbelly uses highly respectable ingredients and has a wheat roll that toasts up delicious . <sssss> the wreck is a truly fine sandwich , nicely filled and tasting like cold cuts i would not be embarrassed to buy at the supermarket . <sssss> the environment is also a bit more soothing than many sub shops : it 's all earth-tones and wooden chairs , so there 's a sense of relaxing . <sssss> the clerks are cheerful even under the pressures of customers with truly peculiar orders . 
4		the medium grilled wings are really good . <sssss> the patio is inviting and the heaters are next to the tables if bit gets chilly outside . <sssss> dig this place ! 
4		for the price , this was a great stay . <sssss> the lobby is beautiful . <sssss> the restaurant/bar is good and reasonably priced -lrb- $ 5 beer and $ 13 dinner , not bad for a hotel -rrb- . <sssss> bed was very comfortable with super soft pillows . <sssss> it is a bit close to the interstate , so there is road noise , but certainly not more than the point of a minor distraction . <sssss> bathroom has been updated , but the room carpet is a bit out of date ; but i 'm not sleeping on the floor , so i can put up with that . <sssss> this is a great hotel for a 3 1/2 star in hotwire . <sssss> i would stay here again ; nice assortment of tap beer and seasonal beer favorites . 
4		the four stars are for their hummus , olive bar , and amazing peanut butter covered pretzels . <sssss> i still prefer fresh and easy or whole foods . <sssss> . 
4		we love going to the arizona biltmore , whether to eat or enjoy the patio off of the wright bar . <sssss> the frank lloyd wright design still blows me away with his detail . <sssss> i do n't know of too many lobbies that have a more beautiful seating area . <sssss> the hotel 's new hollywood and wine events was a great find for us . <sssss> on specified weekends the hotel hosts either comedy or musical acts in one of their rooms . <sssss> we went to the comedy show last weekend and had an amazing time . <sssss> $ 10 for the tickets -lrb- show lasted 2 hours -rrb- and the well drinks were only $ 5 -lrb- includes martinis -rrb- . <sssss> i was paying $ 19 at the wright bar just 100 yards away . <sssss> great comics and overall show . <sssss> the biltmore is worth just visiting or spending a few days to enjoy the spa and golf . <sssss> glad we live right there to enjoy it year round . 
4		this is the honey bear 's no one knows . <sssss> its amazing that the staple of downtown phoenix cuisine is so obscure here in what is essentially the heart of the sprawl that is tempe/chandler/ahwautukee -lrb- phoenix -rrb- . <sssss> nonetheless , honey bears still comes through , with some of the tastiest bbq sauce i 've ever had and a super tasty selection of meats with fries ... so good ! <sssss> the chicken cup is ridiculously good , it was my first intro to hb and i still do n't know what its supposed to be called , its a cup of chicken with bbq sauce ! <sssss> the sausages are perfect here ! <sssss> if you are passing by or live near here , check it out ! 
4		it has been about two years since i last came to honey bear 's . <sssss> the last few time i had visited , i felt like the portions were a little skimpy for the price i was paying . <sssss> however that all changed when i brought my dad for a late lunch/early dinner . <sssss> we order the full slab with potatoe salad and beans . <sssss> man when we got home , the plate was packed with ribs . <sssss> so much so that the two of us sharing was not a problem . <sssss> i am not a fan of potatoe salad , however i will admit that theres was quite tasty ! <sssss> the bbw sauce was better than i remember and although my dad enjoyed the sauce , he makes his own and just had to say there 's is good but mine is still better . <sssss> smh ! <sssss> . <sssss> they have revamped the menu to make it a little more affordable and they seemed to have up there portions a tad . <sssss> way too go . <sssss> my dad enjoyed one phoenix 's hometown spots . <sssss> good job ! <sssss> i will be back again soon for rib tip friday 's ! 
4		good stuff . 
4		i bought a coupon deal online as i got 2 tickets , 2 drinks and a big ole ' boy of popcorn . <sssss> free refills on drinks and popcorn which was the best . <sssss> the popcorn is n't too buttery but just the right amount as i had many hand fulls . <sssss> i do agree , this place is hard to find in the mall . <sssss> park in the parking garage or find the food court . <sssss> the theater was clean but the stall in the bathroom could of used a little sprucing up . <sssss> overall , this place had great customer service . 
4		is there an age limit for those who shop at urban ? <sssss> i hope not because it 's too much fun to browse the store and i do n't want another birthday to keep me from visiting . <sssss> i have been a consistent shopper of urban since my college days at u of a . <sssss> at first , it was because the u of a campus only had limited stores for me to shop within walking distance of my dorm . <sssss> then they became the store with a strong variety of dresses and perfect gag gifts and off the beaten path knick knacks . <sssss> when i finished college and moved to phoenix , i would do the occasional visit if i was on mille . <sssss> but then when they opened up a store at the waterfront , i was sold and came to the conclusion that i could still enter without feeling too old . <sssss> moving on the urban , it 's part of the anthropologie chain so if you like the look of anthro but ca n't quick make it to their prices , you can visit urban where the clothing is similar but a bit trendier and cheaper . <sssss> they have the best gag gifts out there including inappropriate ones sitting right next to the game you have n't played since you were eight . <sssss> and since some of the shoppers are eight , then this is their haven . <sssss> the clothes are funky and fun . <sssss> you can go the traditional route or you can get as trendy as you want in just one visit . <sssss> they have adorable shoes and accessories and i love the housing decorations they sell . <sssss> urban is a great store to visit when looking to make a whimsical purchase , find a deal on some clothes -lrb- they have awesome sales -rrb- , purchase a trendy outfit or simply browse and waste some time when it 's too hot to stand outside . 
4		have to agree with the consensus : 4 stars and 1 $ 
4		pretty good , chandler ~ coming from la , we have tons and tons of thai restaurants . <sssss> this is probably a better asian restaurant i 've had so far . <sssss> clean and friendly service with bright colors . <sssss> we had the green curry and the barbecue chicken - both made right ! <sssss> the place is a traditional thai restaurant whose owner is from thailand himself . <sssss> he was very nice and came over to introduce himself while we were having lunch . <sssss> we finished off our meal with the coconut sticky rice which was yummy also . <sssss> only recommendation would be to have lunch special on the weekends . <sssss> the entire meal put me in food coma / sleep for the next 3 hours and i was n't even hungry at dinner . 
4		the place is great in the garden . <sssss> a little walk coffee and desert . <sssss> plus the main dishes are very interesting . <sssss> fresh local stuff prepared in a nice tasty way . <sssss> the night i was there it was very crowded and the food could have been a little warmer and one person at our tables fish was a little dry but we all said it was a place we are coming back too . <sssss> all in all a very trend cool place with good food and interesting people . 
4		had heard of romanelli 's , but was never on that side of town at the right time to check it out . <sssss> this time it really worked out . <sssss> we ordered two sandwiches - meatball and the george . <sssss> both were on 10 inch hoagie rolls . <sssss> the meatball was piled high with meatballs , sauce , and cheese . <sssss> the george was packed with meat and topped with sweet & hot peppers . <sssss> the bread was fantastic . <sssss> it was crusty , but not so hard that you could bite into it . <sssss> we split a cannoli for dessert . <sssss> crunchy and sweet . <sssss> i would highly recommend romanelli 's . <sssss> worth the trip . <sssss> n * joy ... 
4		dear 16th street , please continue to bring it ! <sssss> just yesterday a colleague at school told me he thought barrio cafe 's food was diminishing in oomph . <sssss> i disagreed , but that evening , i just so happened to bike over to la condesa to try out this new gourmet taco place on 16th . <sssss> the cursive red neon sign , that word `` gourmet '' and the dozens of yelp endorsements ushered us in on a tuesday night . <sssss> warm walls . <sssss> original paintings . <sssss> furnishings from bellas artes de mexico . <sssss> the most substantial wooden tables and chairs in central phoenix . <sssss> when we had opportunity in our conversation to `` knock on wood , '' we felt a bit shamed by the feebleness of our gesture and the robustness of the table . <sssss> order at the counter from a cheerful and demure young lady , whose accent we could not place . <sssss> i linger on the ambiance because others have noted the stellar food . <sssss> your food food for thought : come for the two taco meal -lrb- with beans & rice -lrb- with corn ! -rrb- -rrb- <sssss> , and stay for the fresh and diverse salsa bar . <sssss> this is n't baja fresh . <sssss> this is condesa cuisine . <sssss> think jicama and orange salsa . <sssss> think peanut salsa . <sssss> and the creamiest , zingiest cilantro creme salsa ! <sssss> i must disagree with lali about the beans : america 's tacos ' are more memorable , but you are still right , lali , on a technicality -- the beans at america 's are not pinto ... it 's a secret . <sssss> not really . <sssss> ask them . 
4		i stumbled across this place by accident with a co worker of mine . <sssss> i noticed it had a fifties vibe but was names flaming kabob . <sssss> i had to try it . <sssss> i am a sucker for arabic food . <sssss> i was married to an arab so i know great arabic food . <sssss> i actually love to find little holes in the wall like this and be pleasantly surprised . <sssss> the service is nothing to write home about , but it was n't bad . <sssss> the prices were good . <sssss> i ordered a shawarma sandwich and thought it was wonderful . <sssss> i do n't think i have had it that good in phoenix yet . <sssss> maybe a fluke ? <sssss> do n't know , only been once so far . <sssss> some of the reviews below crack me up . <sssss> someone said the hummus needed spice ? <sssss> um sorry , but hummus does not have spice it !! <sssss> it 's chickpeas , tahini , fresh garlic , salt , olive oil and lemon . <sssss> i loved what i ate and if i am ever in the area again would definitely eat here . 
4		the wild thaiger is one of my new favorite places . <sssss> every dish i 've tried as been excellent . <sssss> they accomodated with some grace a friend with food allergies and were polite -- too polite -- in serving me as i -lrb- unknowingly -rrb- arrived just at closing . <sssss> the peanut sauce on the satay is amazing . <sssss> pad thai is a standby at a thai place , but it definitely does not disappoint here . <sssss> the beef curry was excellent . <sssss> the ginger fish dish less remarkable but still good . <sssss> coconut ice cream dessert is good for putting out the fire . <sssss> good place to go after an art or heard museum visit . 
4		i have flown to and from here multiple times . <sssss> this place is thousands of times better than ord -lrb- old home airport -rrb- . <sssss> there is free wifi and plenty of outlets to charge your electronics in the u.s. airways terminal . <sssss> the workers are friendly and seem to enjoy what they do . <sssss> the security line is actually not a pain in the neck . <sssss> the only downside is the car rental center is significantly far from the airport . <sssss> the bus system to get to it is efficient though . 
4		clean , well run , pool was fun ! 
4		my guest ordered the beef tenderloin and i ordered the skate -lrb- yes , the ` kinda sting-ray ' fish -rrb- . <sssss> the tenderloin was perfectly cooked as ordered -lrb- between medium-rare and rare -rrb- ... a delicious prime cut . <sssss> the skate was buttery-smooth and tender ... it practically melted in my mouth ! <sssss> however , our enjoyment came to a screeching halt when we ordered the `` molten lava cake '' . <sssss> the presentation was fantastic ... a small pyramid-shaped cake next to a scoop of chocolate ice cream within a c-shaped curl of milk-chocolate . <sssss> but the cake was cool to the touch , and the ` molten ' chocolate interior was firm and cold . <sssss> even worse was the mini-scoop of chocolate ice cream ; my guest and i both thought it tasted like chlorine ! <sssss> t cook 's stepped up and brought us another lava cake -lrb- with vanilla ice cream -rrb- . <sssss> no chlorine taste was detected in the ice cream -lrb- whew ! -rrb- <sssss> , but the lava cake was only marginally warmer . <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> and the center was still solid ... definitely not molten . <sssss> the waitress explained that the kitchen could n't heat it up any more or the chocolate core would melt and leak out of the cake onto the plate . <sssss> i 've had molten lava cake at other restaurants with melted chocolate centers ; if they can do it , why ca n't t cook 's do the same ? 
4		it was a toss up 3 or 4 stars , so this is on the 3.5 side of 3 edit : see note below . <sssss> there are so many cool places to try in central phoenix it is almost hard to get to them all . <sssss> this would be an easy 4 star review if my server had been a little more attentive/friendly and my wine had not been hot -lrb- not room temperature , not slightly warm -rrb- we are talking about 20 minute old coffee hot . <sssss> the ambiance is great we sat on the patio right off central ave , so their was plenty of cool scenery , and the weather was perfect . <sssss> started off with the spicy edamame and it was very tasty . <sssss> then followed up with a little chicken curry dish that was probably the best mix of curry flavor that i have ever had and the rice was perfectly done . <sssss> -lrb- that being said i am a super light weight when it comes to spicy food , so this was right in my wheel house -rrb- definitely worth a visit if you are roaming for a good place to grab a unique bite to eat . <sssss> i will be back edit : based on how fast and friendly the owner was in his response to my review i bumped them to 4 stars . <sssss> thanks dana 
4		the best pieces of culinary dropout - put together in an awesome arcadia-esque scene , right in north phoenix . <sssss> if you 're in the area , swing on by - grab some great cocktails/beer - enjoy a tasty bite - and be a kid for a while playing some classic outdoor games . <sssss> this is the type of place i can spend a whole afternoon at . <sssss> expect this place to get busy and stay busy . <sssss> official new stomping grounds of `` sunday funday-ers '' everywhere . <sssss> - good live music with built in stage setup - enormous covered patio with astro turf area - covered bike parking inside -lrb- keep those cruisers safe ! -rrb- <sssss> - joint bathroom sinks provide funny and awkward moments - soon to open oyster bar sure to add more unique options - enough space for more of sam fox 's brain children 
4		after being a huge fan of the mission i decided to try this place out seeing that it 's owned by the same owners even though i was very skeptical that it could possibly be as great . <sssss> to my surprise it lived up to what others had told me . <sssss> the ambiance was amazing . <sssss> very much like the mission . <sssss> candles light up the entire place . <sssss> the outside patio is quite large and there is a lot of seating available . <sssss> the staff was great and very helpful with making suggestions on the menu . <sssss> my favorite items on the menu are the scallops and the apple caramel upside down cake . <sssss> they were cooked to perfection and melt in your mouth . <sssss> they have a great wine list and its a perfect setting to enjoy a few glasses of wine :-rrb- this is a great date night spot that i recommend it now to all my friends . 
4		i very much enjoy this place . <sssss> the duck sandwich has changed my life . <sssss> the brick oven gives the pizza a natural , full flavor , homemade style taste that makes you slow down and enjoy every bite ! <sssss> the atmosphere , the set up , and the bar is all very welcoming and very clean . <sssss> hard to spot when you are driving down the road . <sssss> i have been there about 10 times and i still pass it up sometimes . <sssss> parking is not the best , and valet is not really needed , but they very much have top shelf alcohol and delicious food to boot . <sssss> not extremely expensive either , but pricey enough to make you count your bills before you enter just so you will have enough . <sssss> great place ! 
4		stopped in for happy hour . <sssss> the food is pretty much what you 'd expect out of a fast food place . <sssss> nothing too delicious but they have good prices and a great selection of beverages . <sssss> i do n't think this location does much business . <sssss> we came at lunch time on a monday and they only had 1 person running the food , which was fine for us since there was only 2 other groups of people there . 
4		we booked an all-inclusive package at the arizona biltmore and this was one of the dining options available to us . <sssss> we came here for breakfast each day and for lunch yesterday . <sssss> for breakfast , my husband and i both had the sonoran benedict which was amazing !!!! <sssss> i will come back just to have this dish . <sssss> the eggs are served on jalapeño cornbread which is a nice twist on the classic . <sssss> for lunch we split the nachos and the crab cake blt sandwich . <sssss> the nachos were spicy and cheesy little pieces of heaven . <sssss> the chorizo they put on the chips is amazing . <sssss> the crab cake sandwich was ok . <sssss> having lived on the east coast for a decade , i expect crab cakes to be full of lump crab meat . <sssss> this crab cake was more filling than crab and was too soft . <sssss> i would order a different sandwich or salad next time . 
4		my boyfriend and i came here to celebrate our one year anniversary of our first date -lrb- which was also at cornish pasty :-rrb- -rrb- . <sssss> a year ago when i came hear i loved the ambiance and three dollar car bombs ! <sssss> however , i ordered the pasty my boyfriend recommended that had mashed potatoes -lrb- i hate mashed potatoes -rrb- due to first date jitters , so i could not appreciate how amazing the food is here . <sssss> this time around i ordered the greek chicken pasty and was blown away !! <sssss> the dough is amazing and i was extremely pleased with my pasty . <sssss> i would recommend this place to anyone ! 
4		red robin , yum ! <sssss> the burgers are pretty good , the blta is great when you hold the a -lrb- not an avocado fan -rrb- . <sssss> chesse sticks are pretty tasty and the endless rootbeer float is wonderful ! <sssss> wait , what ?? <sssss> endless rootbeer float ?? <sssss> heaven ! <sssss> unbutton that top button on your pants and get yer food on ! 
4		ca n't beat the tempura chicken strips . <sssss> the prime rib dip with au jus is tough to top . <sssss> you just ca n't really go wrong at any houston 's . <sssss> just one thing - for god 's sake - do not order a bloody mary because they have no fucking idea how to make one . <sssss> that is the only qualm i have with this houston 's . <sssss> any one in atlanta , dallas , new orleans - any place in the south - knows how to make a bloody mary . <sssss> someone needs to let this houston 's know that the first ingredient is ice ! <sssss> c'mon , houston 's ! 
4		so the first time i visited olive and ivy was a few years back -lrb- probably a month after it first opened -rrb- i was not a fan at all . <sssss> however , recently i had heard a few of my friends talking about how good this place was , so i figured it was probably just getting established when i visited before . <sssss> last saturday i decided to give it another go . <sssss> and i am so glad i did ! <sssss> i am a fan of all fox restaurants - but this one might take the cake ! <sssss> the atmosphere and decor was perfect for a saturday afternoon . <sssss> they had the restaurant opened to the patio and the weather was absolutely gorgeous ! <sssss> also they had a small band playing music , which was great ! <sssss> the waitress was a little uneducated about the food and forgot to put in our order for flatbread , but she was nice - so i 'll only take off one star . <sssss> and the food - oh . <sssss> my . <sssss> god . <sssss> the grilled chicken salad was the best i 've had so far and the pasta was delicious ! <sssss> i plan on returning soon . <sssss> i think this might be a new favorite brunch/lunch spot . 
4		i 'm giving this place a generous 4 stars because the food is actually very tasty . <sssss> i 've been here twice now , and i 'm never disappointed . <sssss> indian food has to be on the top of my list for favorite cuisines , and i am sad to say there are n't many or any great indian restaurants that i have found in phoenix . <sssss> flavors of india , however , seems to satisfy my palate . <sssss> i enjoy the chicken tikka masala every time . <sssss> i have also tried the curry chicken , which is also very tasty . <sssss> the chicken is very fresh and tender , both the light and dark meat . <sssss> the naan is a bit flat and not soft or chewy enough for my taste , but it does its job . <sssss> i really enjoy their basmati rice . <sssss> it 's not the most elaborate or flavorful i 've ever had , but for some reason , i 'm drawn to it , and even crave it . <sssss> there 's no saffron or cloves ; it 's a bit on the simple side , and just a tad bit sticky . <sssss> the samosas are decent , although i have had better . <sssss> if you are in the mood for some indian food , and this place is close by , i suggest you head on over . <sssss> prices are reasonable . <sssss> two can eat for 30 bucks , including multiple appetizers . <sssss> the food is prepared quickly . <sssss> it 's not the prettiest of restaurants but it has it 's interesting indian decor with a twist of mexican thrown in . <sssss> at least that 's my impression . <sssss> i do n't like that they are closed on sundays , since that 's when i typically like to eat indian food . <sssss> the quantity is definitely sufficient , and you will have left overs , unless you like to `` pig out . '' <sssss> try it , you 'll probably like it ! 
4		a couple of friends and i had the pleasure of coming here for breakfast after this year 's pat tillman run . <sssss> they had been previously , but i had never heard of it . <sssss> what a nice , little surprise ! <sssss> as other reviewers mentioned , harlow 's gets crowded and this was especially true after the race . <sssss> but despite that , they got us seated within 15 minutes . <sssss> not too shabby . <sssss> service was prompt including the water and coffee for our weary and parched souls . <sssss> i had the cisco , i think it was called , with french toast , two eggs , and sausage links . <sssss> i have had better french toast elsewhere , but i still really enjoyed my meal . <sssss> my companions also had meals that looked delicious . <sssss> perhaps even more so than mine ? <sssss> can you say food envy ? <sssss> anyways , the prices were average and also the ambience . <sssss> i can see the charm of an unchanged place after many years especially when you have been coming for years . <sssss> overall , i thought it was cool . <sssss> would i drive from cenpho for the food ? <sssss> no . <sssss> but i would stop for breakfast if in the area . <sssss> i am glad i had the chance to try it ... 
4		goldie 's is a typical sports bar , great atmosphere , decent t.v. placement and good food . <sssss> their burgers are amazing ! <sssss> -lrb- i personally have the 1000 island burger with avocado/bacon/mushrooms -rrb- , the burgers are big and juicy and filling . <sssss> i completely agree with brian , the first few times that i went during peak hours the place was riddled with children , it reminded me of the wal-mart 's that you find in south phoenix . <sssss> too many kids for a sports bar , but i just could n't stay away from the burgers . <sssss> i recommend going there for a late evening meal or during off peak times to avoid getting kicked/punched in the head by the children . 
4		la mirage mediterranean occupies a wierd pad in nopho 's bell canyon pavillions shoppping center , at i-17 north of bell -- the room 's kind of shaped like a big wedge of cheese . <sssss> but it 's fresh and tidy inside , with twangy m.e. music and an owner-looking guy with slicked back hair sitting in a back office while a couple of women were out front serving customers . <sssss> compared with other m.e. places i 've been , the food was really good , but a good , tasty , quality stand-ard , not stand-out . <sssss> considering that other nearby choices start with `` native new ... '' , `` hometown ... '' , `` apple ... '' , `` hoot ... '' , et al. , this is really a great option to have available . <sssss> i also had the lunch special : : : sammie , side , and drink for $ 5.99 . <sssss> you choose any pita-wrapped sandwich , from among about a dozen different meaty or veggie selections , including chicken or beef shawarma , tika , kabob , falafel , hummous , etc. . <sssss> you can have a soup , house salad or fries , or for a $ buck extra get a tabhouli salad , that i found really tasty , lemony and not too oily , larger than expected , with lots of tomato bits mixed in , and bulgar wheat bits that were closer to soggy grape nuts than chewy couscous . <sssss> after a few initial weird bites , i eventually decided the texture was really nice , and i 'm a fan of it now , over the more common pasta-y bits . <sssss> mixed it into my falafel sandwich , which was really good , but not the best i 've had , just really good -lrb- there will never be another * original * yusef 's , which is my gold standard , well , really they were green ! -rrb- <sssss> they have a stage and do entertainment here as well , with a website to consult for special event dates . <sssss> i 've driven past this place pretty late on a saturday and seen it hopping . <sssss> for some reason they have a dj 'd latin dance night once a week , i think every tuesday . <sssss> -lrb- ?!? -rrb- <sssss> overall really nice place i 'll be back to , for sure . <sssss> maybe not for the live music , but mos def for the awesome lunch special . 
4		one word , confusing . <sssss> i 'm from the bay area california . <sssss> i know a thing or two about malls and shopping . <sssss> this mall is pretty awesome . <sssss> it 's huge and has all the stored i could eve hope for . <sssss> however , whoever designed the floor plan really sucks . <sssss> so confusing . <sssss> it 's like a maze and with sub levels . <sssss> wth . <sssss> some highlights of this mall : + tesla + yard house + madewell , tory burch , pandora + a movie theater ! 
4		delish ! <sssss> the bread was soo soft and fresh and they put just the right about of meat on their sandwiches and condiments as well . <sssss> the establishment was clean and and the staff was super friendly from the greeting we got entering to our exit . <sssss> kinda wish we had one up north by my place , but would definitely go out of my way for this over a subway any day . 
4		great place . <sssss> upscale gay bar . <sssss> i usually have fun here . <sssss> the only reason i give it a 4 star is because of the prices . <sssss> i guess i am paying for the atmosphere ? <sssss> anyway , same drink here that would cost me $ 7 , i can get at another gay bar for $ 4 . <sssss> other than that , definetly a great time and sometimes that $ 7 is very much worth it . 
4		my puppy charlie is only 6 months old and has n't had much socializing but this place was perfect . <sssss> as soon as we got to the park we noticed that their were poop bags located at the front . <sssss> on this visit they were empty however it looked as if someone left some grocery bags as a substitute . <sssss> also , there is a water fountian for the dogs located on the ground . <sssss> another great thing about this place was the fact that there is an area for timid dogs . <sssss> i was n't sure it was going to be a problem letting charlie off his leash . <sssss> the park is very large with trees and lots of running room . <sssss> it is all fenced it so you do n't have to worry about them wandering too far . <sssss> i will definitely be taking him back ! 
4		i had not been to wendy 's in ... forever . <sssss> went last week and tried their 1/2 baja salad . <sssss> it was really good . <sssss> then went again a few days ago and had the same thing and a potatoe . <sssss> i like that they have the soda machines where you can get any flavor . <sssss> they even have diet caffeine free vanilla coke and diet caffeine free cherry coke . <sssss> the yhave remodeled several locations and it really does n't flow well . <sssss> everything is all backed up , no way to escape . <sssss> how about removing that wall so we can go sit down . <sssss> call us up when it 's ready . <sssss> or for the people that are waiting for their to go order , let them have a special seating area to wait . <sssss> they do have several seating areas and then some areas with tables and chairs . 
4		i just had my tahoe in this shop to do my lift kit , they did nice work and were priced better than in flagstaff where i live . <sssss> i would think that they were a more established name in flagstaff . <sssss> work turned out great and they did n't charge me for the alignment at all !! <sssss> being cute must have its perks ! 
4		it is just like the other location , but i like the patio a little better . <sssss> it 's bigger and more open . <sssss> the food and wine are great - just like the other location . <sssss> i am going to spend a lot of quality time here . 
4		a bit of a `` nip '' in the air this morning ... and when i think `` nip '' , i think `` pasties '' and when i think `` pasties '' , well , i just naturally think `` pasty 's '' :--rrb- so there you have it ... that 's how my mind works ... i 've said it before and i will say it again ... linear thinking is the best thinking :-rrb- i get so lonely working away in my plush private office with nothing to keep me company but a steady stream of information and diversions from across the universe ... and my chowchow , deedee ... sometimes i need to get out of my gilded cage :-rrb- today was one of those days , and fortunately for me , my cardiologist buddy , jim , was in a position to prescribe a bangers and mash pasty at cpc , for my continued good heart health :--rrb- stat - -lrb- latin for `` with a side of broccoli and cauliflower '' ... he says they are chock full of `` beta blocker 's '' ... i did n't even know i needed my beta blocked ! -rrb- <sssss> we met for lunch with his longtime friend -lrb- and my new friend -rrb- gary -lrb- who is , among other things , a novelist ... i want to see how he works me and cpc into a book :-rrb- i was pretty hungry after spin class this morning and the waitstaff at cpc wasted no time in getting the retox going for me ... i think service has improved since i was here last and food remains authentic and excellent ! <sssss> neither jim or gary had ever been to cpc before , but they both handled their pasty 's like pro 's and the three of us all joined the cpc - `` cpc '' -lrb- `` clean plate club '' ... i think there 's an award ceremony at the end of the year :-rrb- jim had an oggie and gary tried a greek something pasty and both were fortified against the rigors of the remainder of friday afternoon -lrb- jim had some sort of `` human heart thingy '' he had to do , and i had to come back to my office and type on my computer ... who has the more stressful job ... really ? <sssss> :--rrb- . <sssss> finally , the people at cpc all continue to be so darn happy and pleasant ... i so often see people working at restaurants that look like they hate being there -lrb- and probably do -rrb- that it 's worth noting when everybody from the cooks to the servers all have smiles on their faces and in their voices . <sssss> it 's probably from eating all those pasty 's ... they 're approved by all of my cardiologist buddies , so you know they must be good for you : -rrb- 
4		great service and low prices , restroom is always pretty well kept up . <sssss> this is a big plus for me since that is a area that a lot of businesses ignore . <sssss> i only gave four stars instead of five because often times advertised specials are rarely in stock . <sssss> every day items are normally on hand and fresh though . 
4		i 've got a serious lack of thai food in my area , so it 's always a nice treat to come here . <sssss> we do lunch here at least once when i 'm in town . <sssss> good quality thai staples here - i almost always go with the basil chicken - and you do get the option of naming your spice level . <sssss> the heat levels are just about right , but i never quite push it to the limits . <sssss> plates are a good size for the money , and everything i 've had or tried has been worth it . <sssss> they are closed on the king 's birthday , so that 's a big plus on the authentic thai scale . 
4		being an avid carb lover , it 's safe to say that if it has `` bread '' in the name , chances are i love it ! <sssss> their tomato bread salad should win an award . <sssss> granted , i had never heard of such a thing before , so i have nothing to compare it to , but damn ! <sssss> it is amazing ! 
4		i 've been eating and drinking here since '98 when it was still called teakwoods tavern and grill . <sssss> the waiters/waitresses have always been courteous and the service is fast . <sssss> in my opinion , they have the best wings in the phoenix metro area and some very good sandwiches and burgers . <sssss> if you are looking for a good sports bar to hang out at , i would definitely recommend this one . 
4		this was my very first yelp event . <sssss> everyone built it up to be so great . <sssss> but , even they said , it was not the best . <sssss> first off , very little parking area here . <sssss> being fashion week we thought we would see some fashion , no none , just from the patrons . <sssss> wine was on the house and it was very good . <sssss> so thanks for that . <sssss> food was few and far between . <sssss> but , we did order from the menu . <sssss> very salty . <sssss> maybe we will give it a try when they are not so under pressure . 
4		do n't expect fine dining . <sssss> if you want a nice , greasy burger , you really ca n't go wrong with this place . <sssss> also , they have a neon `` salads '' sign , and that 's just pure awesome . 
4		really nice place with good organization for events here . <sssss> there was no red bull at the bars for the event i was attending , but the bar in the middle of the courtyard had it ! <sssss> this place has a great reputation , and as long as you can afford it , you will be happy with what you get . 
4		lola coffee does it again ! <sssss> already open approximately three weeks ... and i did n't even realize that lola had gone into this location -lrb- previously calabria i believe -rrb- . <sssss> i guess that shows how much time i spend in downtown phoenix . <sssss> -lrb- not enough ! -rrb- <sssss> the gold spot building that houses this lola location has a lot of character and i especially love that there is plenty of parking in the area . <sssss> i also like that there is both indoor and outdoor seating . <sssss> and the reason that i 'm giving this location four stars instead of just three ? <sssss> they have the best barista in town ! <sssss> jensy -lrb- formerly of mama java -rrb- is employed here . <sssss> while i had an iced tea today , i know first hand that jensy makes damn good soy lattes ! <sssss> now , if i do n't get stood up for a meeting during my next visit to this lola location , my experience will be even better ! 
4		awhile back , belfiore 's used to be called amorosos & sons -- a top-notch place to get new york style pizza and delicious italian pastries . <sssss> i do n't think it is owned by the same people anymore , but it still has that ny italian vibe and the pizza is still pretty good . <sssss> you can order a regular crust pizza or sicilian style . <sssss> i 'm not a big fan of thick-crust pizza , so we decided for the regular crust . <sssss> it was a little greasy for my taste , but definitely better than what most pizza places serve . <sssss> and , their cannolis are to die for ! <sssss> i recommend the ones dipped in chocolate . <sssss> you ca n't get any more decadent than that ! <sssss> one last thing ... expect to wait . <sssss> their pizzas are made to order , so it takes awhile to get served , and it can get pretty busy , so be patient -lrb- i will try to take my own advice on my next visit . -rrb- <sssss> . 
4		had a great meal . <sssss> the food quality is 5-stars . <sssss> we ordered 2 drinks , the mussels , the duck bacon salad -lrb- fyi : duck bacon is not crispy -rrb- , croque and mentioned that we would be sharing everything . <sssss> i was surprised when they brought it all at once . <sssss> i guess i should have specified that we would be taking our time and savoring courses . <sssss> servers were attentive and kept trying to clear our plates which , if we were ready for them to be gone would be good , but we were enjoying dipping the fries in the mornay sauce . <sssss> on the 4th try , we gave up and let them take it . <sssss> :-rrb- prices are beyond reasonable for the quality and from 4-7 every day , get $ 1 off all food and drink items . <sssss> our bill came to $ 50 plus tip . <sssss> worth every penny !

4		i have been eating tessio 's for years and it is awesome . <sssss> the place is definitely a dive , delivery or take-out only . <sssss> they have like one table , a couple of chairs and a counter ... that 's it . <sssss> the pizza is always good ... a little greasy , but good . <sssss> i typically get a large two topping pizza and couple of dozen wings for $ 22 - $ 24 . <sssss> make sure to ask for specials before ordering . 
4		dear rose , i have to be perfectly frank with you . <sssss> while you are sweet , kind and fun to hang around with i have to admit something , i am in love with your husband . <sssss> i know , i know . <sssss> . <sssss> i have never even seen his face though i have heard him sensually barking out to you in chinese , wishing it was me . <sssss> tho , most importantly , i hear the music he makes with his wok ! <sssss> the sweet clang and clatter with fire blazing from underneath , your husband is a man of talent . <sssss> when im down he knows exactly what to make to help me to feel better . <sssss> crab in onion and ginger sauce as part of the number 1 special , only 19.99 , is something of a long passionate kiss . <sssss> the accompanied green beans in xo sauce feel like he is giving me a massage from inside my tummy . <sssss> . <sssss> to top it off , 1/2 a roast duck and steamed rice . <sssss> . <sssss> oh the joy and bliss someone can bring you ! <sssss> so rose . <sssss> . <sssss> please understand when i say these things . <sssss> . <sssss> i know you work just as hard as he does but he is something of a mysterious person . <sssss> . <sssss> i would gladly fetch his slippers . <sssss> love , foodiebear ps . <sssss> . <sssss> wahsun rocks my world ! 
4		i love chipotle . <sssss> i think it has fresh and delicious options . <sssss> i was turned off for a while because my usual chipotle on thunderbird gave me a salad with a giant green bug crawling in it . <sssss> i finally wanted it again and went to this one . <sssss> they were nice and the food was great . <sssss> my usual chipotle experience . 
4		my family has been going here since before i was born , mom and dad actually stopped there on the way home from the hosptial when my brother was born . <sssss> my mom learned how to make sweet and sour sauce from one of the first cooks . <sssss> although it has gone through 3 owners , i think in my life , they have always kept it the same . <sssss> the number selections are small compared to today 's mega chinese buffetts , but their fried rice is the best i 've had on any buffett . <sssss> the other dish i highly recomend are the meatballs ! <sssss> my bro and i always call ahead to see if the meatballs are on the buffett that day . <sssss> they are like nothing i 've had anywhere else , sauce is sort of a cross of sweet and sour and a really bold bbq sauce . <sssss> most the other dishes are just moderate in taste and quality . <sssss> the service is always friendly and quick . <sssss> i reconize it may not be everyone 's cup of tea , but i think every should try it at least once . 
4		excellent pasties . <sssss> both the bangers & mash and red curry chicken tikka masala pasties were very tasty . <sssss> great ambiance . 
4		best mexican food in the valley for the money ! <sssss> location is in a not so good part of town but a lot of local police and fireman eat there during lunch time during the week . <sssss> the tortillas are made fresh and you end up wanted to take some home with you . <sssss> the red chili burro is very good and the rice and beans is so fresh it makes your mouth water thinking about it ! <sssss> there is a line during the week so be prepared but the food is ready in no time . <sssss> staff is very nice and friendly , food is hot and fresh , not too bad ! 
4		i love the legit places in the downtown neighborhood that have seen it through all of the transitions and still are respected and are staples in the community . <sssss> la tolteca is one of those phoenix restaurants that has been there for decades . <sssss> my grandmother used to buy her corn husks from them to make tamales , which is so amazing to me . <sssss> i first went here for a burrito and fell in love with it 's legitimate mexican street food taste , and it filled me up and made me happy ! <sssss> the atmosphere is festive . <sssss> you order at the counter , gaze at the bright colors surrounding you , and watch the wide array of people eating and talking . <sssss> it 's festive ! <sssss> there are no frills here , it is just simple and delicious . <sssss> i have been back for the huevos rancheros and love the runny eggs and beans and fresh tortillas , aye ! <sssss> so good . <sssss> i will keep supporting their authentic menu and spreading the word ! 
4		heck yes , i will eat this again . <sssss> had delivery of the bbq chicken pizza last night . <sssss> was told 45 mins to an hour wait . <sssss> ok , fine . <sssss> it was here in 20 minutes . <sssss> hot , fresh , nice crunchy crust , thinly sliced red onions , nice pieces of chicken and some damn good bbq sauce . <sssss> we are new to the area and this was our first , but certainly not our last , go at this place . <sssss> appreciated the reviews to help us make the decision . <sssss> yum . 
4		i like their chicken sandwich and they have great shakes ! 
4		urban is a great studio ! <sssss> classes are always available so it 's easy to get a yoga class around your busy schedule . 
4		what a great place . <sssss> service was excellent and the food was outstanding . <sssss> i really appreciated the wait staff taking the time to correct a small error in the order . <sssss> they did a great job rectifying the situation . <sssss> overall a great experience and a better choice in carefree than some others . <sssss> -lrb- see other reviews -rrb- . 
4		the food is pretty good , especially for phoenix . <sssss> you ca n't go wrong with seafood pad thai or the thai chili eggplant . <sssss> they do n't charge extra for more rice unlike krua thai . <sssss> the service is n't is as fast as it was when nick was the manager , but the food is still the same . <sssss> i do n't recommend the thai boba tea ; it was n't very good . <sssss> the boba was really overcooked . 
4		always enjoyed everything i 've had there , cocktails , lunch & happy hour . <sssss> good presentation and atmosphere . <sssss> good service and wine list . 
4		this is quickly becoming one of my most favorite lunch places ... they have the best hummus in town , and their gyro meat is off the hook . <sssss> i usually order the gyro salad ... it 's a huge portion , so it could probably be shared ... we 've also ordered the lamb shank , which was pretty good ... kind of has some curry flavors and a stew like sauce to go with , it 's pretty good , but maybe not as good as the gyros . <sssss> if you are in the area and need a quick lunch , do n't pass this place up ... order extra pita to eat up all that hummus ! 
4		it 's early sunday morning , and , as i often do , i want lox . <sssss> lots of lox . <sssss> in the past we went to kashman 's , but the times are a changing and jj 's delicatessen has improved on our usual new york-style deli . <sssss> to start , breath easy , because lupe is still there , greeting you warmly as you walk in and making sure you find a seat . <sssss> he 's great . <sssss> the menu has changed a bit , and there is a sports theme running through the menu and the decor . <sssss> the new owners seem to be mets fans , and my beau may or may not hold that against them . <sssss> we ordered the l.e.o omelet -lrb- lox , eggs , & onions -rrb- and the veggie skillet . <sssss> they both came with a bagel and schmear , and the omelet also had a side of fruit . <sssss> everything was freshly prepared to-order and came out quick . <sssss> the staff was very accommodating when something came out wrong and quickly addressed our concerns . <sssss> i greatly enjoyed the omelet - it was simple , and had the right proportion of lox to eggs . <sssss> i might have peppered it up a bit more , but i like food with a kick . <sssss> the veggie skillet was also very good - lots of potatoes , mushrooms , tomatoes , onions , peppers and cheese ! <sssss> you can order the skillet with any combo of veggies , meat , and cheese . <sssss> come hungry , because the skillet is a serious portion ! <sssss> the bagels and schmear are made in-house and are pretty good - not exactly like my favorite new york bagels , but a nice compromise . <sssss> i do need to return to try the knish ! <sssss> i thought the prices were a bit steep for a delicatessen , but perhaps the prices go with the portion size . <sssss> some things seemed to be priced correctly or even slightly under-priced , like the skillets that come with a bagel , or the omelets that come with a bagel and side of fruit or potato -lrb- $ 10 or less -rrb- . <sssss> other dishes , like the lox platter seemed a bit steep -lrb- $ 10.95 -rrb- . <sssss> then again , i 'm not sure how much lox come with the platter , so maybe it 's not such a fishy deal after all ! <sssss> i 'll have to investigate the other menu items and do a little more price comparison to decide . <sssss> overall , jj 's is a welcome addition to the neighborhood and a great place to stop in for sunday brunch , or any time you are craving some jewish comfort food . 
4		entertainment - great ! <sssss> tapas - great ! <sssss> service - great ! <sssss> entrees - mediocre we tried the sole and the tenderloin with shrimp entrees and i did n't find either one really up to par . <sssss> the shrimp was fishy and not tasty at all . <sssss> the tapas we had were good - the lamb and the ox tail . <sssss> there was a live flamenco performance that was really great ! <sssss> service was excellent . <sssss> i would go back to this place , but i hope they improve on some of the food items . 
4		the square footage of this place is about the same as my credit score . <sssss> but i am not opposed to a cozy , dive bar on the phoenix/scottsdale border . <sssss> this place actually reminded me of bars in san fran the way it is long and narrow . <sssss> this place had a good vibe and crowd -lrb- ages ranging from early 20 's to mid 50 's -rrb- . <sssss> the grilled wings were pretty delicious and the drinks were definitely reasonable . <sssss> my tab was around $ 50 after 2 dozen wings , 3 draft beers , 2 chick drinks , and a pair of jameson shots . <sssss> the owner of the joint -lrb- and i know he was the owner because he was helping himself to drinks behind the bar -rrb- walks around and glad-hands the regulars while swapping tales of past and soon-to-be glories of sooner football . <sssss> i have never even set foot in the great state of oklahoma but after a few drinks at this bar , it will have you whooping `` boomer sooner '' with the rest of the regulars . <sssss> whatever-the-fuck that means . 
4		love the atmosphere , staff and price ! <sssss> i had a falafel pita , which was delish ! <sssss> however , after looking up the nutritional information on their website , i saw that i had consumed over 800 calories ! <sssss> next time , i would be more cautious about my order , but overall ... everything was great ! 
4		walnut shrimp was fantastic ! <sssss> beef chow fun -lrb- flat noodles -rrb- was also very good . <sssss> a kid friendly place with nice staff . <sssss> kids loved the egg tamago too . 
4		quaint store . <sssss> very very friendly . <sssss> clean . <sssss> mist spray if you choose to sit outside . <sssss> the aroma of coffee when you enter is pleasant and not overwhelming . <sssss> so i finally strayed from my norm of strawberries and cream . <sssss> i tried the orange mango smoothies . <sssss> wonderful ! <sssss> you could taste the banana , the orange and the mango . <sssss> simply mouth pleasing ! <sssss> i absolutely will have this again . <sssss> i have always enjoyed the variety of flavors of coffee , now i have found other flavors ! 
4		at the start of the old town drag by the courtyard of the scottsdale museum of contermporary art -lrb- smoca -rrb- and an art piece dedicated to love stands a longtime jewel of the old town scene . <sssss> at this place , you feel concious of how you appear for there are beautiful women and handsome men with their lovers , and stalkers , laughing , smiling , flirting , kissing , loving ... life ... and az88 . <sssss> this restaurant/nightspot has been a subject of lore . <sssss> at this place the martinis are big and kickin and for an evening you can feel simply beautiful and sexy . <sssss> the music is pumpin with sick beats by their dj upstairs . <sssss> there 's an art piece in the center that exudes sex ... iness . <sssss> and the bar reminds you of how this la-esque place is here in our turf but scottsdale is not phoenix , it 's a bit of san diego , a bit of santa monica , a bit of the marina in san fran . <sssss> and you realize that its handsome men with handsome men and hot women with sexy ladies and everything in between . <sssss> this is the place for gay men and women , and straight allies . <sssss> the drinks are delish , and exquisite , here a glass of something with bubbles just makes sense , couple it with a martini or two with shaker makes sense . <sssss> and their burger au poivre just messes with the senses ... it 's overwhelming and so good ! <sssss> this place is contemporary chic . <sssss> not ikea chic like its hot cousin fez in our cenpho which in my opinion is attaining landmark status on central . <sssss> this place celebrates the hotness of the old town crowd . <sssss> so if ever i want a late night place , and want to see and be the scene . <sssss> i head over with some hot teases and have a fun time . <sssss> hope to see you there one night , just wink . 
4		adorable little healthy place ! <sssss> food is excellent and service was impeccable . <sssss> the pita is fresh and grilled , rice pilaf is tasty but not salty . <sssss> the chicken kabobs are tender and juicy . <sssss> salad dressing comes in a bottle on the table - be sure to shake it before you use it ! <sssss> must try - fresh homemade limeade . <sssss> very tasty and not too sweet ! <sssss> most fun ? <sssss> their awesome fountain drink machine - fun and techy . <sssss> definitely not your run of the mill fountain machine ! <sssss> yummilicious factor = a - 
4		this place has it all . <sssss> great food , great ambiance , great wine and great service . <sssss> went there the other night . <sssss> i had veal scallopini , my husband had linguine with seafood in a spicy red sauce . <sssss> both were wonderful . <sssss> the chocolate gelato was great and my cannoli tasty . <sssss> i love that joe visits with each table and ` shakes the can ' for the chance to win a free meal . <sssss> they now have ` joe 's back door ' new york style pizza to go . <sssss> you order ahead and literally pick it up at the back door . <sssss> that is on my ` got ta try that list '' . 
4		i came here with a friend who has been here many times and recommended it . <sssss> i was n't disappointed . <sssss> first , we came during the lunch rush and it was busy . <sssss> however , we were still seated immediately and served by a friendly waitress quickly . <sssss> the food then came out in about 5 minutes ! <sssss> i had the rib tip plate , and it was very good . <sssss> my friend had the pulled pork sandwich which was also good . <sssss> it 's out off the beaten path but worth the trip . <sssss> when you pull into a place out in a strange location , and it 's packed ? <sssss> good sign . 
4		just tried noodle and rice for lunch . <sssss> i got the teriyaki & vegetables w / chicken lunch special . <sssss> the food was really good , the vegetables were crispy and seemed fresh , and you ca n't beat their prices . <sssss> my only complaint was that it took about 20min to get my food to go , but that is an easy fix to simply call ahead next time . <sssss> will definitely be going again . 
4		we chose this place based on high yelp reviews for dinner before our girls night out . <sssss> looks like a hole in the wall place in a sorta sketchy area but i felt safe in a group . <sssss> this was a two man show on saturday night . <sssss> the hostess/waitress/bartender / cashier was awesome and the cook has serious skills ! <sssss> the margaritas were $ 7 and made from fresh fruits and great quality tequila ... best margaritas i 've had in a long time ... and not the sugary syrupy kind ! <sssss> everyone 's dinners were perfect and the homemade chips and salsa were delish . <sssss> i highly recommend this place ... i will be back ! 
4		shocking news ... joi b is giving an airport a 4-star review -lrb- is this a first ? <sssss> possibly -rrb- . <sssss> well , it * is * tooted as `` america 's friendliest airport '' and they do n't lie ! <sssss> i like friendly airports ! <sssss> oh yeah , i like this airport a whole hell of a lot . <sssss> - extremely easy to navigate between gates in the terminal - super fast check in -lrb- just about as fast as kansas city , which is a much smaller airport -rrb- - courteous security personal and getting past it is a breeze . <sssss> i did n't even mind them throwing out my open bottle of water that i stupidly forgot to take out of my bag -lrb- i guess they are trained so that this airport lives up to its reputation . <sssss> st. louis airport : you need to send your security personnel to train in phoenix -rrb- . <sssss> - adequate food and beverage choices pre - and post security gate - bright and sparkling clean environs -lrb- yeah , so it 's dated . <sssss> at least it 's not dated and dingy . <sssss> it also seems in keeping with a lot of the design styles i 've encountered in my 5 days in phoenix -rrb- . <sssss> - good amount of bathrooms , clean and no lines - gate/flight info is easy to find anywhere - stunning view of the landscape from the wall of windows at the end of gate d - baggage area is clearly labeled and easy to navigate - good signage all over - there are tiny finches instead of rats hopping along on the floor looking for food -lrb- at laguardia , you 're far more likely to find the latter ... oh and btw i mention this because one just ran past my feet and my instinct was to jump up out of my seat . <sssss> but imagine my delight upon seeing a cute bird instead of a filthy rodent ! <sssss> woohoo !! -rrb- <sssss> spending time airports is a regular occurrence for me and i dare say that this time has been a pleasurable experience . <sssss> only negatives : not enough outlets -lrb- as is typical , swa provides those uncomfortable bars you can sit at to plug in -rrb- . <sssss> internet may be free but it 's hella slow . <sssss> at least it was today . <sssss> reading what some other people say about having to connect here and navigate the terminals , i 'll hold back a star in case i ever have to deal with this inconvenience -lrb- and knowing my luck and past experience with airports , it 's bound to happen -rrb- . 
4		visited sandella 's for the first time this evening and was very impressed . <sssss> the food was very good . <sssss> i tried the buffalo chicken panini , which i highly recommend . <sssss> the hawaiian flatbread pizza was also very good , was the vege panini . <sssss> we also tried a couple of cookies and a brownie ... nothing special . <sssss> mind you , this is a pretty quick sandwich , fountain drink and chips kind of place - however - the service was very good and the manager who assisted us was very accommodating . <sssss> on that note , we took advantage of their weekend special at the recommendation of the manager : any three entres , drink and side for $ 18 . <sssss> that 's a pretty good deal for the quality of food we got . <sssss> i will definitely visit this place again . 
4		ahh the familiar smell of asian supermarkets ... there 's just something i love about it . <sssss> lee lee 's is huge and they have aisles and aisles of fun stuff for us westerners to gawk at . <sssss> i 've never seen frozen grubs , spikey durian fruit , or such a large selection of fresh fish until hitting lee lee 's today . <sssss> i love how the organize the aisles according to country , making it easy to navigate the store and figure out what you 're looking at . <sssss> they even have sections that included hawaiian and middle-eastern specialities in addition to indian/pakastani foods . <sssss> i have to agree with tom t that lee lee 's is slightly more pricey that some of the other asian grocers out there , but if it 's close by and you want lots of variety then it makes up for it . <sssss> if you live far i would recommend the grocery store at the chinese cultural center instead . <sssss> side note , this place is great for buying gluten-free flours like tapioca and rice flour , etc. . <sssss> . <sssss> i got a bag of tapioca flour for .69 ... it would be triple that at most health food stores . <sssss> the plaza right around it also has all sorts of asian businesses and two vietnamese restaurants that i will have to check out in the future . 
4		my first trip to the duce was to see the scandalesque show there . <sssss> i had no idea what to expect , which was good , because i would have been wrong . <sssss> inside the duce , you 'll find the following : a very casual restaurant , a boxing ring , a vintage -lrb- real vintage , not the fake-vintage hipster fodder -rrb- clothing store , an ice cream bar , a tiny boutique-ish grocery area , a café , and -lrb- coming soon -rrb- a pie shop . <sssss> i can only review the restaurant part . <sssss> the dining area has walls , but no ceiling , making the atmosphere interesting . <sssss> it also made the atmosphere really cold ... half of the propane heaters were n't turned on . <sssss> the menu is small , with mostly brunch items and sliders , but they do have a few salads and larger plates . <sssss> the salads our group ordered were delicious , and the sliders were original and surprisingly fresh . <sssss> i also had a side of their homemade beans and cole slaw . <sssss> the beans seemed to be sweetened with maple syrup to the point where i almost could n't finish them . <sssss> the slaw was just flat-out odd ; i still have no idea what was in it . <sssss> but it was also incredibly tasty ! <sssss> on the down side , i think the management is still trying to figure out how to run the place ; they seemed overwhelmed by the crowd even before it got very crowded . <sssss> but i have faith that this will work itself out . <sssss> parking is pretty sparse , but this is downtown ; you should expect that . <sssss> and some of the pricing on the menu does n't make any sense : a gourmet salad was only $ 5 , but a tiny dollop of baked beans was $ 3.50 ? <sssss> i hope they make some adjustments soon . 
4		so i stopped in late on thursday , with an out of town work buddy , because it had been a really rough week . <sssss> we sat outside -lrb- heavenly ! -rrb- <sssss> and drank wine and had some apps . <sssss> the burrata and olive appetizers were both heavenly . <sssss> we also ordered the casanova and splurged on the fruit crisp ... thanks for helping up both regain the will to live , federal ! 
4		great selection ! 
4		i like this place . <sssss> it 's very ... comfortable ... it was warm from the cold outside . <sssss> -lrb- i 'm a native !!! <sssss> i ca n't take 65 degrees ! -rrb- <sssss> and smells amazing . <sssss> their pizza smells so good , it 's ridiculous . <sssss> walk in ... they do have a bar ... complete with barstools , neon signs , `` tacky '' -lrb- but i like them -rrb- posters from movies ... we sat in the group section . <sssss> i was coming in expecting to have their cookie with ice cream to celebrate my birthday and leave . <sssss> we ended up having the soho salad pizza , fried calamari , and then their cookie . <sssss> i 've had their pizzas in the past -lrb- pre-yelp -rrb- and i really liked them . <sssss> you know ... their soho salad pizza was great . <sssss> four stars . <sssss> completely makes you feel that you are not eating something high in calories at all . <sssss> very tasty and we would definitely order it again . <sssss> i was telling my partner that it was reminiscent of cpk 's salads . <sssss> almonds , feta cheese ... and of course the awesome dressing that was n't too heavy . <sssss> calamari ... i was ok with it . <sssss> three stars for me . <sssss> while i agree that i 've had better , i did n't think it was terrible , but at the same time , it could have been crispier and with more seasoning . <sssss> it was fairly bland . <sssss> i think the sauces that went with it made it . <sssss> and of course , the cookie . <sssss> halfway cooked ... just the way i liked it with two huge scoops of vanilla bean ice cream . <sssss> :-rrb- 5 stars . <sssss> :-rrb- gooey ... warm ... soppy ... perfect . <sssss> :-rrb- and it 's not too big . <sssss> sharing between two people is n't uncomfortable for the belly ... even after having the soho salad pizza and the fried calamari . <sssss> we 'll be back . <sssss> i want to have their pizza again . <sssss> : -rrb- 
4		the wait is long . <sssss> . <sssss> and the food is great !!! <sssss> i really like the white fish sashimi and the spicy scallop sushi . <sssss> . <sssss> the ambience is very nice and mix crowd can be spotted . <sssss> it is a little bit more expensive but it 's worth it to try . 
4		for the price , this is a great great indian place for lunch ! <sssss> for $ 8 , you can get a great lunch special , 2 naan , rice , salad , & entree . <sssss> the curries are very well made and the naan is hot out the oven . <sssss> i love it here . 
4		stopped in here for a quick drink + snack while waiting for a friend to finish her wedding rehearsal at brophy chapel across the street . <sssss> between the two of us , hubby and i had a lemonade , iced coffee and some sort of ganache cake concoction . <sssss> all were pretty good . <sssss> the barista was friendly , sweet and attentive , and the ambiance was upscale hipster . <sssss> easy parking and not too crowded . 
4		fast . <sssss> easy . <sssss> staff is so so . <sssss> the jj 's in wisconsin are awesome !!! <sssss> no other state can come near to their pep ! <sssss> the cashier was leaning on the counter and would just say `` yeah . <sssss> ok . <sssss> what else ? '' <sssss> subs were made fast . <sssss> store needed some love from all the crumbs piled everywhere and over flowing trash . 
4		there is such a thing as `` grilled meatloaf '' . <sssss> and everyone should experience this wonder . <sssss> it 's not my mother 's meatloaf . <sssss> -lrb- shh ! <sssss> sorry mom . <sssss> this is better . <sssss> i 'm really very sorry . -rrb- <sssss> tucked on a corner of the the shops at gainey village is a quaint little restaurant , complete with an outdoor patio . <sssss> alas , the patio and i were not properly introduced as the super comfortable looking loungers and tables were already scooped up . <sssss> instead , my friends and i were greeted like friends at the bar and found three -lrb- count 'em , three -rrb- stools right in a row waiting for us . <sssss> i do n't know if the patio is always this super busy , as this was the 1st thursday of the month . <sssss> there 's music 1st thursdays -lrb- until march of 2014 -rrb- in the center area of the shopping area with different live bands . <sssss> i do know that reservations are not taken for the patio area . <sssss> it 's first come , first serve ! <sssss> so hurry kids , hurry ! <sssss> those seats look mahhvelous . <sssss> given how delish the food was i can understand why . <sssss> hoh boy . <sssss> our group took the hearty advice of rick , a super bomb diggity bartender , and went with the `` hot crab dip '' . <sssss> the serving size is large and plenty for a group of three . <sssss> if i were to attempt this at home i 'd perhaps throw in a hint more spice . <sssss> -lrb- maybe a touch of celery . -rrb- <sssss> but really , this gal was sassy pants happy scooping away at the dip . <sssss> the provided copious amounts of toast to enjoy the dip which was rather nice . <sssss> my friends shared a cobb salad . <sssss> i had to laugh at them . <sssss> the serving size was gigantic . <sssss> huge . <sssss> i turned away the opportunity to sample what looked like a wonderful salad . <sssss> i was being single minded in my determination to eat as much as possible of my meat loaf . <sssss> -lrb- my friends said the cobb was very much to their liking . <sssss> they eat out quite a bit , so i take their word for it . -rrb- <sssss> grilling meatloaf put a new spin on it for me . <sssss> ok , fine . <sssss> the menu does say `` family specialty '' . <sssss> i was majorly bummed this morning when i remembered my left-overs where not , in fact , in my apartment . <sssss> they were sacrificed in the name of car pooling . <sssss> yes , that happened . <sssss> my heavenly grilled meat loaf was sent off to a better life . <sssss> and i did not get to enjoy left-overs today . <sssss> i will go back to the village tavern and eat this again . <sssss> thank you rick the bartender for a * great * recommendation ! <sssss> -lrb- also , you were a wonderful server ! -rrb- <sssss> oh ! <sssss> and the house red is a new friend of mine . <sssss> -lrb- five bucks ! -rrb- <sssss> ca n't go wrong here . <sssss> update ! <sssss> update ! <sssss> i sat on the patio ! <sssss> no wonder this spot is hard to come by . <sssss> very large area with super fine seating . <sssss> comfy . <sssss> so comfy no one wants to get up :-rrb- this time my visit was during a sunday brunch slot . <sssss> boy ! <sssss> no joke . <sssss> 11:30 is a popular time . <sssss> we were super lucky and scored the last table . <sssss> on a saturday , i doubt this would ever happen . <sssss> -lrb- i heard men dragging their families inside with , `` no . <sssss> we have to sit inside so i can watch `` the '' game . '' <sssss> yay for me ! <sssss> i mean , us . <sssss> there was a group of us : -rrb- 
4		we spent new years eve here.the place was packed ! <sssss> however , the staff was very friendly and they were doing everything they could to service the crowd fast . <sssss> we shared a room with another couple . <sssss> the room exceeded my expectations ! <sssss> the decor , linens and layout was superb . <sssss> i do think it is a bit pricey for a hotel where you are spending your money gambling ; however , the four of us definately will be going back ! 
4		really good burgers and the oak stout beer is really smooth and tasty . <sssss> the outdoor seating was nice and the inside was really big , a little loud but a good atmosphere with cute waitresses ... 
4		i am really glad aliria reviewed this place ! <sssss> i was literally driving on my way to danny 's car wash for an oil change when i quickly yelped lightning lube and saw her sole review standing proud with four stars . <sssss> i will admit that when my phone notified my friends i checked in here , i got a few ... questioning ... text messages due to the name , but i would gladly head back here any time for an oil change . <sssss> i love no-nonsense care places , and the young lady who helped me at the front did n't try and sell me anything extra . <sssss> she just let me know that my windshield wipers were all but useless -lrb- a fact i 've noticed every time we receive a rare rain shower . -rrb- <sssss> i was so shocked that i was n't pressured into a $ 100 transmission flush that i nearly fell over . <sssss> the service was really fast and the total came to a very reasonable $ 30 total - not bad for supporting the little guys against the shady midas ' and jiffy lubes ' . 
4		i 've never been let down when i go to firebird with a date . 
4		good breakfast spot . <sssss> it can get kind of crowded and you might have to wait a while . <sssss> once you get seated the service is very prompt . <sssss> our meal was served very quickly and it was very delicious . <sssss> they have your standard breakfast menu here as well as some of their own breakfast specials . <sssss> i tried the border plate , which was like a frittata with chorizo and monterrey and cheddar cheese . <sssss> it was very good . <sssss> the chorizo was very delicious . <sssss> excellent breakfast place with good service 
4		well `` off da hook soul food '' was closed and we saw this place across the street . <sssss> overall we were pleasantly surprised at the quality and authenticity . <sssss> usually shun at the sight of eggplant , except this time i felt like trying something different . <sssss> the eggplant on the appetizer menu was delicious ! <sssss> from what i understand it 's earth , sweet and moves food stagnation in the large intestine , it also has a cooling/moving effect on the blood , along with moisturizing lungs . <sssss> since it moves blood i can see how it might help with age spots . <sssss> thanks to this place i 've been turned on to eggplant ! <sssss> oh and they have jasmine tea also . <sssss> qi foods ! <sssss> ps . <sssss> next couple days my stool stayed firm and felt clean . <sssss> tmi ? 
4		i love ikea . <sssss> so busy but nobody 's rude and the store is n't trashed . <sssss> sometimes you find things you never knew you needed , like a dog butt leash rack . <sssss> :-rrb- after wandering for a bit , i always feel like i can cheaply and easily remodel my entire home . 
4		yum ! <sssss> i am so glad this place has opened and robert mcgrath is back doing what he is great at . <sssss> i wo n't hide the fact that i am a huge fan of his . <sssss> he catered the rehearsal dinner to my wedding with the great food of roaring fork -lrb- before it was sold -rrb- . <sssss> went last night for an early dinner and the reservation list looked like it was extremely full . <sssss> we started with the signature green chile pork stew and it was delicious . <sssss> slightly different than the way it was prepared at rf , but it is something i would definitely get again . <sssss> i had the big ass burger -lrb- oops , i mean bob 's burger -rrb- and it was fantastic . <sssss> it was slightly over cooked , but i attribute that to the kitchen still getting all of their timing down . <sssss> the burger and side of fries are huge and probably the best value on the menu for $ 12 . <sssss> my wife had the blackened catfish and said it was fantastic . <sssss> we also had some of the green chile mac , but we already knew that would be great . <sssss> the best part about this new place is that the staff is very professional . <sssss> i ca n't tell you how many new restaurants i have been to where they end up hiring a bunch of kids who do n't know anything about food or service . <sssss> renegade seems to be staffed with people who are excited about the restaurant and it shows . <sssss> ca n't wait to go back . <sssss> bar menu includes one of my old time favorites of buzzard breath chili served in a bag of fritos . <sssss> we will definitely be back and this place will make it into our regular rotation of great places to go . 
4		my good friends surprised me with some cupcakes from top it for my valentine birthday treat . <sssss> the red velvet and salted caramel were amazing !! <sssss> they were so delicious , i went myself a few days later to give to my boyfriend to try . <sssss> the malt ball was moist and flavorful , and my boyfriend loved the vanilla with chocolate . <sssss> i 'm dying to try the cotton candy and pbj flavors . 
4		this place was recommended to us by some friends , so we decided to try it on a whim one night . <sssss> the decor was very modern and earthy . <sssss> our server was very knowledgable about the items on the menu , and gave my husband the advice of trying to `` half portions '' of the asian dishes he was debating between . <sssss> turns out the half portions are huge . <sssss> he took almost a whole one home . <sssss> the teriyaki was a little bit too salty for my taste , but i thought the curry dish was excellent . <sssss> i had the steak tacos adn i thought they were also very well done . <sssss> the men at the table next to us ordered some hot sauce to go along with theirs , and i think i 'll do that next time too . <sssss> i 'll definitely be coming back here , especially when my sister is in town because they have a variety of gluten free menu items . 
4		first time trying . <sssss> great portion of pulled pork - tender and juicy . <sssss> the bbq beans are very good . <sssss> the potato salad was bland but not awful . <sssss> i was n't impressed with their sauces but mixing the spicy with the smokey gave me something acceptable . <sssss> the mustard based glaze was good but i 'll have to try that one something else next time . <sssss> and there will be a next time . <sssss> the staff was great . <sssss> the hole-in-the-wall places are usually good . <sssss> oh yeah , bring your own plastic spoon ! <sssss> you 'll want it to get every drop of those beans ! 
4		the charm of this waffle house shone through during a late breakfast on a somewhat lazy saturday afternoon . <sssss> my buddy and i selected this restaurant simply because it was en route to our pressing weekend chores . <sssss> the interior is dated and the staff are friendly and talkative , but this place has just the kind of small-diner charm we were in the mood for . <sssss> they even have an old-timey jukebox in the corner that plays 45 's . <sssss> the prices are completely reasonable . <sssss> throw down $ 7.50 for the breakfast all-star special ... it 's a no-brainer . <sssss> you get eggs , bacon , toast , grits -lrb- or hashbrowns -rrb- and , of course , a waffle . <sssss> you will be tempted to modify your order , however , as there are a surprising number of options available , including eight different additions to your hashbrowns : onions , cheese , ham , tomatoes , jalapeños , mushrooms , chili or sausage gravy . <sssss> i dug the banana nut waffle , as i was craving pecans from my past memories of southern comfort food . <sssss> all told , waffle house hits the spot when you feel the urge to stuff your gullet . 
4		the blue moose is a fun place to go to hang out with friends and enjoy some good conversation and some decent food . <sssss> i have been going off and on to the `` moose '' for almost 6 years . <sssss> the staff is friendly and the service is great and the food is average for being a bar . <sssss> try the crispy chicken wrap if you are a fan of chicken . <sssss> it has this tasty sauce , lettuce , tomato , and cheese as well as warm chicken wrapped in a flour tortilla . <sssss> i like it because you do not have to get the chicken fried if you do not care for the extra calories . <sssss> they offer it grilled if you request it and it is good either way ! <sssss> the outdoor patio is a nice place to sit and relax when we are beyond the summer months . <sssss> this place is a bar but not very crowded the majority of the time and a nice place to go to have a nice romantic evening with your honey or just hang with your buddies over some ice cold beers . <sssss> the place is only loud during the month of march when spring training is taking place . <sssss> yes , please bring back the shuffleboard table . <sssss> i miss it also and it was a popular gaming piece for all to play and enjoy ! 
4		great mexican food . <sssss> really yum as my husband says . <sssss> there are almost none choices for vegetarian . 
4		kincaid 's is sort of our `` go to '' spot , the food is consistent , the service better than most and face it , the bar is beautiful . <sssss> it is rarely jammed packed -lrb- not that i 've seen anyway -rrb- although we are n't trying to get in at prime time either . <sssss> obviously they do n't try and rely on window business , they are a chain but i 've never bothered to visit one in another city when i have one right here . <sssss> chains are n't my bag baby . <sssss> if you want good solid service and food this is the place , no they are n't trying to reinvent the wheel but their halibut cheeks are delightful and you wo n't be grumbling about the service . 
4		i 'm from china , this is the only place in az i go for dim sum . <sssss> very good variety on weekends , not bad on weekdays too . <sssss> not the best i 've tasted in my life but certainly the top in arizona . 
4		i like the way this location has started to show some one the more indie movies like the recent showing of winter 's bone . <sssss> other than that its a regular multiplex with has everything you would expect so no complaints at all ! 
4		i do love dunkin donuts ... specifically the toasted coconut and chocolate frosted cake . <sssss> :-rrb- pretty much 99 % of the time i get the coffee & 2 donuts combo -lrb- of course the toasted coconut & chocolate frosted cake -rrb- . <sssss> i used to go here way too often -- so often , that they know it 's me when i order at the drive-thru . <sssss> cause i get the `` toasted coconut & chocolate frosted cake '' ... and seriously , i have to say that everytime -- cause for a long time they would mess up and give me a chocolate glazed donut or chocolate frosted glazed donut - - def not the same . <sssss> friendly staff . <sssss> make sure you get the coffee punch card if you order alot of medium-sized coffees here ... 
4		overall , my husband and i thoroughly enjoyed our experience here . <sssss> the pizzas were excellent , we were satisfied with our salad -lrb- not bad , but not amazing ... it 's a salad -rrb- and the staff was on point . <sssss> i noticed the manager and staff members `` table touching '' . <sssss> the ordering/payment location is a bit crammed , i bet it 's annoying when they are busy . <sssss> the other thing i saw people struggling with is whether they sit at a table or order from the counter . <sssss> nothing is clearly marked , not everyone has common sense . <sssss> we 'll definitely be back . <sssss> ! 
4		scottsdale road has just about everything including oscar filet at flemmings , ohhh yea ! <sssss> talk about decadent , they were serving a special the night we were there that included the oscar topping for the filet . <sssss> something about jumbo lump crab meat slathered on top of a perfectly cooked steak that is ... . <sssss> well ... just plain awesome ! <sssss> add a side of asparagus and a wedge salad with a nice cocktail and damn if that is not the start to a kick ass evening . <sssss> as always this location on the weekends was packed including the bar area , thank goodness for reso 's . <sssss> something about this flemming 's has more je ne se qua than the `` run of the mill '' flemmings -lrb- if there is such a thing -rrb- . 
4		i 've been going here for a couple of months and i enjoy it quite a bit . <sssss> the studio is clean and bright , very inviting . <sssss> everyone i 've interacted with here is very nice , the staff as well as the other customers . <sssss> the times for the classes are convienent and i 've been to both morning weekend classes and afternoon weekday classes . <sssss> the class itself is very challenging with small controlled moves designed to tone and create lean muscle . <sssss> the instructors are good at adjusting you to make sure you are in the correct form . <sssss> i do sweat in class and my muscles burn ! 
4		this place is tiny and its a liitle bit in the cutties ... this is another one of them down places . <sssss> so foofoo warning in effect . <sssss> start with koolaid but get some water to cut it . <sssss> this is the sweetest koolaid ever . <sssss> its good ... i think the ratio is 1 jar of water , one pack of koolaid , one pound of sugar ! <sssss> lol ! <sssss> the waffle is great . <sssss> the chicken ... awesome . <sssss> desert was amazing ! <sssss> banana pudding was off the hook . <sssss> im mobile.so sorry i ca n't write too much more but this place is worth stopping at if you 're ever in phoenix . <sssss> comfortable great music great food . 
4		i do n't like getting my hair cut . <sssss> i do n't like just sitting there while someone fidgets around my head . <sssss> i have to fight the urge to look at my watch every few minutes when i 'm in the chair . <sssss> on the other hand , my curly hair goes crazy when it gets too long . <sssss> life is about tradeoffs . <sssss> the other part about haircuts i do n't like is the upselling . <sssss> i know it 's part of their job . <sssss> i accept their capitalist drive to maximize profits . <sssss> but no matter how i answer , `` so what kind of shampoo do you use ? '' <sssss> they look at me like i 've said `` bat urine '' . <sssss> -lrb- for the record : pantene shampoo and conditioner . <sssss> see ? <sssss> not bat urine . -rrb- <sssss> gentleman joe 's does n't do that . <sssss> they do n't seem to sell any haircare products , unless you count combs . <sssss> so really they do n't care how i take care of my hair . <sssss> they care about making it shorter and better-looking . <sssss> and they do that very well . <sssss> i always get compliments on my haircuts . <sssss> maybe that 's just because i no longer look like the unabomber , but i 'm still giving the guys at gentleman joe 's the credit . <sssss> after the haircut you get a scalp-and-shoulder rub with one of those vibrating-hand things . <sssss> it 's not a massage , but it 's a nice touch . <sssss> guys , if you 're looking for a good haircut at a good price , i recommend gentleman joe 's . 
4		the best gyro 's i 've had here in the phoenix area ... and huge ! <sssss> very inexpensive -lrb- less than $ 7 for a gyro combo -rrb- and great flavor . <sssss> try the greek salad and gyro combo -- but be forewarned -- their gyro 's are very big ! <sssss> it 's a little slow in the kitchen but worth it if you 're craving a gyro with fries or salad ... very casual , which is great if you 're not up to getting dressed to go out to eat ! 
4		we are lucky enough to live basically right accross the street . <sssss> the food is great . <sssss> love the thin crust pizzas and the sweet potato fries . <sssss> they grow a lot of their own veggies . <sssss> they seasonally sell dates at the farmstand that are great . <sssss> you get your food free on your birthday . <sssss> gets very crowded on the weekends ! <sssss> the dessert is just ok , but the shakes are great ! 
4		went straight from work to check out mekong plaza last night after chatting with coworker `` jj '' about the good deals she found there . <sssss> she was able to find her fave brand of rice , grapes , garlic , and other items . <sssss> she was lamenting that she only had twenty minutes to look around ; she therefore allowed herself to buy those items she knew cost less here than at lee lee . <sssss> after she 'd listed off what she had paid $ 53 for , i told her she should count her blessings that she only had those few minutes to shop ! <sssss> i asked her if she preferred it over lee lee , and while she liked the newness of the place and the lower costs of some items , she did n't like how items in the produce section were plastic-wrapped ; she liked being able to hand-pick her veggies and fruits . <sssss> another coworker had mentioned the plaza 's opening to me days prior and had piqued my interest the moment she uttered the words , `` there are five restaurants ... '' i was getting hungry while jj and i chatted , so there was no question where i was heading to after clocking out . <sssss> as i pulled into the almost empty parking lot at around 8:20 p , i noticed that the entrance doors were flagged by two restaurants - one called mylynn cafe that was still open for business , and the other looked like a coffee shop that was already closed for the day . <sssss> i grabbed a menu from mylynn -lrb- beverages that included fountain , coffee , and smoothies , $ 5 or less , and a page of chef 's specials of about 8 or so items , soups mostly , $ 5-10 -rrb- intending to stop here after my pit stop at the grocery . <sssss> this building is huge ! <sssss> i saw white everywhere i looked - floors , statues , and walls . <sssss> most lots -lrb- indoor shops -rrb- were still unoccupied , and i was beginning to think i may never find the grocery store as all i could see where closed shops -lrb- dentistry , jewelry store , a movie rental shop , etc -rrb- and more restaurants . <sssss> when coworkers mentioned there were a few eateries in place , i expected to encounter a layout similar to that of whole food 's -lrb- ray/101 -rrb- , so this building really threw me for a loop - walking around mp actually felt like i was perusing through one of the mini-malls back home -lrb- philippines -rrb- . <sssss> thinking it over just now , i also remember malls in nj that had similar layouts . <sssss> but i digress ... i spotted two `` opening soon '' food-court type sections for korean and japanese food before turning the corner and finding two more vietnamese restaurants -lrb- vietnamese restaurant and un-pho-gettable -rrb- . <sssss> these venues stood right across from the grocery store . <sssss> finally , i reached my destination ! <sssss> before investigating the grocery , i entered un-pho-gettable and skimmed through their extensive menu and saw the entree prices ranged from around $ 8 to $ 20 or more . <sssss> i asked a person who seemed like the manager what time they closed . <sssss> he replied usually 8p , but if it 's busy then they would close at 8:30 p. i told him that if they were still open , i would return shortly . <sssss> a quick glance around mp revealed large seafood , meats , and refrigerated sections -lrb- not counting those refrigerated aisles that wrapped around the back of the store -rrb- . <sssss> indeed , these three departments occupied a third of the grocery . <sssss> do n't quote me on this , but i think that the produce department was also a part of that section , but i was n't looking for fruits or veggies that night . <sssss> i was on the hunt for the filipino aisle , specifically for brands of peanut butter other than lily 's , which is the only brand to be found at lee lee . <sssss> unfortunately , i only found the one brand , which is $ 0.20 less here . <sssss> i did , however , find preservative-free jackfruit and macapuno -lrb- `` coconut sport '' -rrb- strings -lrb- two delicious components of a nectarous icy snack/beverage called halo-halo -rrb- . <sssss> to keep this review from tiring the both of us , i will wrap it up by saying that i will definitely be back to have another longer look around the aisles , which did not seem as country-specific as lee lee 's . <sssss> it does reverberate highly with me already bec . <sssss> i found those last two items . <sssss> what else would i find ?? <sssss> i 'm brimming with anticipation ! <sssss> btw , since the pho place was already closed by 8:40 p , i decided to try the one next door , which had a vietnamese title and ended with `` vietnamese restaurant . <sssss> review will be posted shortly . 
4		it had been awhile since i plied the lanes , but what the heck , i 'm glad we did . <sssss> what a fun place to hang out on a friday/saturday night . <sssss> you 'll need to wait till after 10pm -lrb- league fills the place till then -rrb- , and preferably have a reservation . <sssss> the lounge was nice , drinks well done -lrb- though a little skimpy on liquor -rrb- and the munchies decent for a bowling alley . <sssss> the `` cosmic '' bowling was a blast with several of us drinking a little too much . <sssss> i managed to win a few games , which certainly impacted my rating . <sssss> the place is freaking busy ! <sssss> as most popular hangouts are ... though with a surprisingly young hip crowd . <sssss> let the good times roll ... -lrb- sorry -rrb- * you can get a regular and substantial discount emailed to you if you register on their website . 
4		talk about quirky . <sssss> it 's got it all . <sssss> the tasting bar is the way to go . <sssss> i think the veggie quesadilla is good . <sssss> i also like the carnitas . <sssss> they even have cookies with your meal . <sssss> it 's a place you have to try . <sssss> if you are into a fancy place this is not for you . <sssss> i happen to think good food can come fro some hole in the wall places . 
4		donut central i am a fan . <sssss> and not because you are the only donut shop within 10 miles of my house no no , because your donuts melt in my mouth even when my fiancé says they should n't . <sssss> your selection was rather bland and i hope you better stocked on my next visit . <sssss> i do n't always eat donuts but when i do i eat donut central ! 
4		great boba tea/bubble tea ! <sssss> three of us went here tonight with a hankering for it , and we all came out satisfied . <sssss> there are a bunch of ways to order it : smoothie , milk smoothie , milk tea , and slushie . <sssss> two of us got milk smoothie -lrb- one banana , one taro -rrb- and one of us got slushie -lrb- mango -rrb- . <sssss> all of us got boba pearls in our drinks . <sssss> the taro boba was outstanding -- five stars . <sssss> great flavor , creamy , perfect texture and thickness -- smooth but still slushy and drinkable . <sssss> yummy , yummy . <sssss> the banana boba had real banana in it -- also good flavor , and excellent texture and thickness . <sssss> silky , because of the banana . <sssss> it was also creamy . <sssss> four stars on this one . <sssss> the mango boba did not contain milk , and was fruity , but either used flavoring or frozen fruit for the mango rather than fresh . <sssss> four stars here , too . <sssss> the boba on all of them was soft and delightfully chewy , just like it should be . <sssss> they had other things on the menu , like ramen , which i want to try sometime . <sssss> i 'll definitely be back for boba ! 
4		i had the pleasure of relaxing at this spa on a lazy sunday afternoon in the middle of the phoenix summer . <sssss> i ca n't think of a better way to spend my free time and i just wish i had the funds to do it more often . <sssss> this spa is tucked away on the south end of the jw marriott resort at desert ridge . <sssss> the entire spa changing area was very clean and organized and there was always a friendly staff member close by to assist you with anything . <sssss> i had the couples massage -lrb- gift from the guy i was dating -rrb- . <sssss> it was my first couples massage and probably my last . <sssss> i enjoyed the actual treatment but the idea of two other people in the room made me feel a little on edge . <sssss> i 'm not quite sure what the deal is with the couples massage anyway . <sssss> it 's not like you are looking at them -lrb- the room is dark -rrb- . <sssss> after the massage we changed into our swimsuits and went down to the pool to relax and get a bite to eat from the spa bistro . <sssss> i had a veggie burger and `` spa chips '' . <sssss> the spa chips were basically veggie chips but they were yummy as was the burger and much needed after the treatment . <sssss> the pool area was very relaxing -lrb- no children -rrb- and you can even reserve the cabanas if you would like to have more room to lounge . <sssss> i think more locals do n't frequent this spa b/c it 's quite a drive -lrb- unless you live in no . <sssss> scottsdale/no . <sssss> phoenix -rrb- but it 's well worth the drive . 
4		good stuff here , i can get a protein packed lunch at a good price . <sssss> also enjoy getting to pick my salsas out and trying new ones . <sssss> the workers here were really nice and looks like they had a decent lunch crowd which is good to see . <sssss> i will be back . 
4		i have been trying to find other taiwanese restaurants , and finally saw this place in an asian newspaper . <sssss> the menu has a good selection of ramen noodle soups , mini authentic taiwanese dishes , and of boba drinks . <sssss> i had ordered the nanchatte ramen , almond milk tea & green milk tea , and beef wrap w/green onion pancake . <sssss> the ramen was just ok ; it is better than ramen noodle house . <sssss> the beef wrap w/green onion pancake was small for the price . <sssss> i had better beef wraps . <sssss> the best was the boba teas . <sssss> it was n't overly sweet , it was perfect ! <sssss> the service was excellent . 
4		this is my go to place when i 'm working and need pho fast ! <sssss> the prices are good , the flavor is good , and the service is good . <sssss> i 've tried better pho , but since this is one of the places close to my work , unless i want to wait 2 hours to get my pho even thought i ordered over the phone , i will continue to go back . 
4		i recently had a take-out order that was incorrect from this location . <sssss> everyone knows how heartbreaking it is to get home after a long day , looking forward to chowing down a greek chicken pita , and being sorely disappointed to find your order is not correct . <sssss> however , when i called zoe 's , rather frustrated , the employee i spoke to -lrb- i believe his name was seth -rrb- offered to drop off the correct order off on his way home ! <sssss> i was completely caught off guard . <sssss> after such an offer i could no longer be upset . <sssss> the night was saved ! 
4		this has always been one of my favorite places to end the evening for one last drink . <sssss> i loved when it was j chew co. and the piano player ... they still have live music and the duo were not bad . <sssss> the bartender was great , very nice guy . <sssss> we came in for a martini and a vodka concoction . <sssss> asked us specific on our preferred vodka made sure our drinks were to our liking . <sssss> he did not disappoint . <sssss> great place to come when it is nice weather then you can sit out on the patio or the upstairs open area . <sssss> do n't pass this place up . 
4		after posting my earlier review , i was contacted by kelly . <sssss> he has offered to give me the same deal , 2 tickets and a bottle of wine , for a future visit . <sssss> i gratefully accept and look forward to an improved experience . <sssss> this is a business that knows how to keep their guests coming back . <sssss> certainly , filmbar has a strong presence , and fills a need for film goers who are looking for local art and independent film maker 's works . 
4		dien xing or dim sum or little bit of heart . <sssss> whatever its called , this is a weekend morning ritual that i loves when we were growing up . <sssss> of course it meant getting up at 6 am and out the door and in the car for a 2hour ride to los angeles to get into the la chinatown and then sitting through my parent 's selection of dishes that we kids never really dug , only wanting the bao tze or shrimp har gow , shui mai or the sweet sesame balls . <sssss> now that i 'm an adult and moved far away from los angeles , i 've come to appreciate the dim sum weekends and the strange foods my parents always selected . <sssss> the place in arizona that is a very good place for dim sum is china king . <sssss> saturdays and sundays starting at 10 and going to about 2 you will probably need to wait a bit before getting a table because a lot of other families had the same idea as you . <sssss> but it definitely is worth the wait . <sssss> some great dishes to get are any and all their shrimp dim sum dishes , they sometimes will do other tsong fun type wraps . <sssss> excellent jiao yen you yu or fried calimari . <sssss> dan ta or custards are excellent . <sssss> the sesame balls are freshly made and crispy and qq at the same time . <sssss> gan lan tsai or chinese broccoli is well done and perfectly served . <sssss> one of the best dishes is their chicken feet or phoenix claws . <sssss> their version is one of the best i 've ever tasted . <sssss> tripe , ribs , and other dishes are also served . <sssss> desserts are available too . <sssss> these are the mango puddings , almond jelly , rice sponge , sesame balls and others . <sssss> go with a bunch of friends or bring lots of family because if you go with just yourself and someone else then you really wo n't be able to sample all the dim sum dishes this place has to offer . <sssss> the other plus is if your in the southeast valley this is definitely closer than golden buddha at the chinese cultural center . 
4		i love this menu , and style of cooking - the decor is bad , though . <sssss> they need a design makeover , save the open kitchen . <sssss> that being said , i had a delicious meal : chicken empanadas , cuban enchilado shrimp , and a light , buttery torrontes . <sssss> the latin flavors were authentic and very well thought out , and my dishes were all neatly executed . <sssss> friendly and attentive waitstaff . <sssss> i think this place would do so much better were it not in a b list resort . 
4		we ended the evening here with a scoop of raspberry sorbet , delish ! <sssss> prices are cheap . <sssss> quality is huge and fun atmosphere . <sssss> great fun for all ! 
4		so i have to say , for the most part , i like this gym . <sssss> i like the array of classes they offer and they do have special class events as well . <sssss> although , i wish they had more during the weekends . <sssss> the staff is friendly and helpful . <sssss> the hours are awesome cause it lets someone like me and my erratic sleep schedule get in at random times of the day/night to get my workout on . <sssss> it does get busy at the predictable times and you can have to wait for some machines when that happens . <sssss> but i find that when that happens , i can just go grab free weights . <sssss> i did notice that they changed the layout a bit in one area -lrb- i do n't know when that happened , maybe i just lack powers of observations since i usually go for classes and then i chuck those deuces -rrb- and i have to say i 'm not a fan of that . <sssss> i am already self conscious when i 'm at the gym so to have me doing my floor work and ab work in front of people using machines is something i do n't love . 
4		i went to this place with a few friends of mine and they warned be ahead of the time that there may be a line . <sssss> with that in mind , i left my house 20 minutes late . <sssss> by the time i got there , they were barely being seated . <sssss> the food was delicious . <sssss> the only problem was my waiter did n't speak english . <sssss> the agua fresca was amazing ! <sssss> must try this place . 
4		i was in the mood for some good mac and cheese , and people seem to like the pork chile verde mac and cheese here , so i gave it a try . <sssss> very good , more than enough for a meal . <sssss> chips and salsa were good , and the empanada was delicious . <sssss> i kicked things off with a blackberry mojito , one of many flavored mojitos on the menu , so i 'll definitely be back to try the rest . 
4		favorite sushi in the area . <sssss> happy hour sun-thurs , all night . <sssss> i think they are closed for lunch on the weekends . <sssss> awesome rolls for like $ 3-4 and the best shrimp shumai ! <sssss> place gets packed so you could end up waiting , but it is definitely worth it . <sssss> oh and they only serve wine and beer . <sssss> would get 5 stars but the service is n't that good . 
4		it 's not often that i get to go to super walmart but when i do i make sure to spend my money 's worth ! <sssss> after getting a whole bunch of groceries i was happily shocked when the total was under $ 25 ... if we had gone to the grocery store everything we bought would have certainly been way more than that . <sssss> the store is also super clean and super big , i 'd probably go there everyday if i lived there , the savings can not be beat ! 
4		the only reason they do n't get 5 stars is because there is n't any bacon here . <sssss> had no idea this place was a vegan/vegetarian or whatever label you want to call it . <sssss> delicious ! <sssss> is what i rather call it . <sssss> they have soups , menu is ever changing , ca n't get bored with that . <sssss> right around noon is when they get their rush , before/after that there is n't to much of a wait . <sssss> it 's like walking into the deli section with out all the deli . <sssss> there needs to be more places like this . <sssss> try the soups . 
4		holy moly , i have found the near perfect sandwich place in downtown phoenix ! <sssss> two co-workers and i went last week for lunch because we were craving good sandwiches . <sssss> parking was a breeze with a free parking garage right there , and there are plenty of spots , so it alleviates one headache that usually comes with dining in downtown at lunch during the week . <sssss> the decor is modest and the grocery section is pretty limited , but the products they did have for sale would make for a good meal or two . <sssss> there is a very limited number of tables inside and out , so make sure to beat the lunch crowd . <sssss> i 've only sampled one sandwich so far which was the caprese . <sssss> the bread was so fresh and soft and was the perfect compliment to the fresh mozzarella and tomatoes . <sssss> i forgot to order it without red onions , but luckily there were n't many on the sandwich and most bits were easy enough to pick off . <sssss> the thing that impressed me the most about the sandwich was that the tomatoes were cut in little bites which is the way i prefer to eat them . <sssss> i was able to get a burst of cheese and tomato in every bite , which i find is n't always the case with caprese sandwiches at either places . <sssss> for my sandwich and bottled soft drink , it cost me approximately $ 8.50 . <sssss> the sandwich menu left me drooling , so i know i will be back in the not too distant future to try another one ! <sssss> the one negative is that they have a minimum $ 25 credit card purchase requirement . <sssss> while they do have an atm right inside the front door , i can only assume the fees are not very cheap . <sssss> so remember to have cash or , if you go with a small group , order everything together and use one card . 
4		z pizza is great ! <sssss> i used to go here for lunch all the time with my co-workers -lrb- we went through a phase when we were going there at least once a week -rrb- . <sssss> they have a great variety of pizza and almost every slice i 've tried has been very good . <sssss> the guys who work at the tatum location are awesome - super friendly and great service ! 
4		this is my new breakfast go to . <sssss> they are open and ready at 6am . <sssss> i love the staff here bright and cheery at 6am is not easy . <sssss> their 2 for $ 5 breakfast burritos are killer . <sssss> they are different as they are more like an omelette in a tortilla . <sssss> my next comment is to be taken with extreme caution !!!! <sssss> their brownies and cinnamon rolls are addictive . <sssss> i can take or leave brownies . <sssss> first they are huge and first bite is an explosion of brownie heaven . <sssss> if you are in the dog house with your wife ; forget the flowers ! <sssss> get her a brownie from this place and its a sure shot winner winner chicken dinner . <sssss> their sandwiches are good also . 
4		the food was very good and we liked that there were several vegetarian items . 
4		this place is really good . <sssss> more family friendly than other restaurants of its type . 
4		little rangoon features novel cuisine , well executed dishes and quite reasonable prices -lrb- thx to the 30 % discount -rrb- . <sssss> seven of us shared a unique family style dinner in a pleasant atmosphere , for under $ 100 before tip . <sssss> we liked all four curries , but agreed the fish and pork belly were best , while beef and chicken seemed more an accomodation to western tastes . <sssss> i normally dismiss tilapia as a cheap bland whitefish , but it 's a knockout with the curry . <sssss> everyone liked the tobu salad , and tea leaf salad got raves from my wife , who 's not a particularly adventurous eater . <sssss> deep fried opa squash has a flaky texture , like swordfish , and was also quite good . <sssss> what stands between little rangoon and five stars ? <sssss> an owner waited on us , which has its charms , but he was also kinda tone deaf in terms of certain aspects of table service . <sssss> portions arent big , and passing the shared plates around there was more a feeling of rationing than of plenty . <sssss> nobody starved , of course , but a better server could 've handled that and some other little things better . <sssss> not a huge deal . <sssss> overall , we had a very positive experience , and recommend this place if you 're seeking something different , arent in a hurry and dont want to break the bank . <sssss> dont let the hidden location or lack of customers discourage you . <sssss> the food really is quite good , with a handful of intriguing dishes , and worth the trip . 
4		you 'll find all kinds at this local no frills neighborhood dive ... bankers to barflies . <sssss> clean , cool staff , cheap drinks and good times . <sssss> i like to sneak in here for afternoon ballgame viewing . <sssss> pool table , juke box , and a fish tank ! <sssss> enough said . 
4		a great local spot . <sssss> i i ca n't really say anything that has n't already been said about this place . <sssss> it 's about as much fun as you can have , to the point i feel like i 'm just having a bunch of friends at my house for dinner . <sssss> part of me wishes they would expand the hours or make the place bigger , but i think that would ruin the experience . <sssss> keep up the great work !! 
4		gluten free creations just bought lulu 's so the cafe will now be entirely wheat and gluten free ! <sssss> will post an update as soon as the new place is open . 
4		i 'm not a football expert by any stretch so this review is strictly based on entertainment value . <sssss> i watched my very first live professional football game today with you against the team i pick if i have to pick one just because i was born in their city , the 49ers . <sssss> i had a great seat in section 134 , in the 8th row , which overlooked one of the end zones from the side . <sssss> in the sea of red , i sat amongst both cardinals and 49er fans and not one fight broke out . <sssss> i was expecting an altercation of sorts to happen somewhere cuz this game got progressively tense until the 49ers blew it at the end . <sssss> but the cardinals were completing passes like no ones business and apparently , according to the bf , `` my team '' stinks . <sssss> anyways , the cardinals had no intentions of allowing the 49ers to maintain any sort of lead and i watched it all go down with beers in my collector 's cup and a couple chomps of my friend 's az dog . <sssss> today 's game included a special tribute for veteran 's day and jordan sparks sang one of the best national anthem 's i 've ever heard at a pro sporting event . <sssss> i was super excited to be here in glendale breaking my football cherry . <sssss> i had started watching a few games before coming so i could get up to speed with what little football knowledge i have from my days of being the high school half time show . <sssss> i know that r stands for referee and lj stands for line judge . <sssss> but that guy with the bj on his striped jersey ? <sssss> he must be the new guy ; -rrb- 
4		friendly , small business atmosphere , great tasting ice cream and within walking distance from my home , which proves to be a hindrance on my waistline . <sssss> ca n't go wrong with bubble gum and birthday cake ! 
4		a groupon led us to try this place and it was pleasing . <sssss> i 'm always on the hunt for a good veggie burger and since they had the veg . <sssss> option , i wanted to give it a try . <sssss> with lots of different toppings and sauces , you can pretty much fix it up however you want and get something you enjoy . <sssss> i was also happily surprised by the fries with chilli -lrb- we got the vegetarian chilli -rrb- and cheese - it was happy hour so appetizers were a super deal and this was yummy . <sssss> i would imagine that it would be a great place for meat eaters - but i have to say it was pleasing for me as a vegetarian too . <sssss> i 'm glad i got the groupon and gave it a try ! 
4		stopped by here today during our big driving around phoenix adventure . <sssss> we both ordered a lg dirty chai . <sssss> me hot nf milk , he iced soy . <sssss> both fantastic . <sssss> that 's all we got , ten something for that so not cheep but as i drink my last sip i know it was well worth every penny . <sssss> i live far so that 's sad for me . <sssss> this is a true coffee house , starbucks could take lessons !! 
4		i have been here twice now and both times the food was good . <sssss> there menu is a nice break from traditional vegan fare . <sssss> i like the vibe of this place . <sssss> the community style seating with the long shared table is a nice touch , but they also have smaller tables if you want to get some privacy . <sssss> the food also comes out really quick so this place makes for a great lunch location if you are in the area and on a tight schedule . 
4		my picks : bananas foster shake sweet potato fries -lrb- but the zucchini fries were a close second -rrb- buffalo chicken sandwich -lrb- if you do n't eat red meat -rrb- banana crème pie this is the place in town to go for a burger and a shake . <sssss> too bad i its so much food that you can possibly eat all 4 of my favorites in one meal . <sssss> bonus points for sam fox opening the restaurant to the phoenix children 's hospital special guests prior to the general public . 
4		sala thai was the latest stop on my husband 's and my quest for the holy grail , a.k.a. our search to find satisfying and authentic thai food in phoenix . <sssss> i must say that sala thai is among the best places we 've tried since we arrived here from california . <sssss> we met jim w and audrey w -lrb- our fellow voyagers on our thai food search -rrb- for dinner at sala last sunday night . <sssss> as jim mentioned in his review , sala thai is n't nearly as far away from south phoenix or chandler as you would think it is , especially on a weekend night when traffic is minimal . <sssss> the restaurant was decently crowded when we arrived , but we got a nice booth just a minute or so after . <sssss> it took us a while to decide what to order as the menu was huge and had a lot of new , interesting dishes like the `` thai egg bomb '' -lrb- think thai omelette , not the sulphuric smell released after eating too much pad see ew -rrb- . <sssss> after a long deliberation -lrb- thank you to our waitress for being patient with us ! -rrb- <sssss> , we selected the pork satay appetizer , pad thai with chicken , catfish panang curry , spicy basil fried rice with beef , and the duck curry . <sssss> just as at swaddee -lrb- our favorite thai place so far -rrb- , we were asked to select a spiciness level from 1 - 5 . <sssss> we picked a different level for each dish , so we could see what the range of spiciness was like . <sssss> well , as jim also mentioned in his review , the pork satay was disappointing - while the peanut sauce was great and not too sweet , the pork was overdone and chewy . <sssss> the duck curry was decent , although it was a little milky for my taste . <sssss> i prefer my curry to have a thicker consistency and less coconut milk . <sssss> the duck was great , though , with a nice crispy skin . <sssss> similarly , the crispy catfish topped with panang curry could have been improved with a thicker and more intense curry . <sssss> the fish was good-quality , however , and was definitely a nice mild compliment to the curry 's spiciness . <sssss> the real stand-outs for me were the basil fried rice and the pad thai . <sssss> the pad thai had an almost meaty flavor to it -lrb- must be a different regional version of the dish than the sweet/sour or peanuty versions that are served at most thai places -rrb- , and was just the right level of sauciness . <sssss> i was also impressed with the quality of the chicken . <sssss> the basil fried rice was outstanding as well - the beef was perfectly tender and flavorful , and the crispy bits of basil added a wonderful flavor . <sssss> since the curries are what keep me coming back to a thai place , i was a little disappointed that sala 's were n't as good as those i 've had elsewhere in the area . <sssss> however , our meal was highly flavorful and enjoyable , and i would definitely rank sala up towards the top of the places we 've tried in phoenix -lrb- see my list at http://www.yelp.com/list_details?list_id=pa46iqom92l75uqoyyurlq -rrb- . <sssss> jim and audrey - i look forward to the next stop on our tour ! 
4		an interesting place to visit . <sssss> my husband and i went on the tour . <sssss> i loved the history and the uniqueness of this castle that is n't a castle . <sssss> but just because it was n't a castle to me , does n't mean it was n't to whoever built it . <sssss> i think the best part was learning about how he turned things into something useful . <sssss> the only down side was that the gift shop had been closed down . 
4		loved it ! <sssss> great happy hour ! <sssss> 6 apps/3 drinks / only $ 47 ! 
4		3.5 stars came here for hh on a tuesday . <sssss> loved the ambience , sort of a beachy type feel . <sssss> we ordered all the appetizers listed for hh , including the sliders , grilled cheese sandwich , wings -lrb- buffalo -rrb- , and bruschetta . <sssss> food was decent , my favorite being the grilled cheese sandwich . <sssss> a nice place to wind down with good company . 
4		this place is terrific . <sssss> we have been here 5-6 times now and have tried many dishes . <sssss> all are very good . <sssss> they have a great happy hour from 3-7 and belly dancing on friday and saturday nights . <sssss> if you like indian cuisine or have never tried it , give this place a shot . 
4		tanzy is in a real cool spot at the q , right next to ipic , salt , and narcise . <sssss> the look of this place is gorgeous , very modern and elegant , and feels like a lounge as well as a nice restaurant/bar . <sssss> the drinks are very delicious , and original . <sssss> i 'm not a huge fan of the food - overpriced salads and unsatisfying appetizers . <sssss> they do have a sunday brunch that is worth checking out . <sssss> seems like they always have open seating , and they also have nice views . 
4		just brought my pup roi to get neutered . <sssss> the staff was pretty good , they treated my dog with care and i think they did everything pretty quickly , drop off at 7:30 am and pick up at 3:00 . <sssss> they did kinda try to upsell a bunch of stuff that kinda sounds like your dog is going to die if you do n't but that 's just the way it goes now-a-days . <sssss> the vet himself was kinda dry and a little short with words , but i did n't have many questions , the vet techs were very friendly and informative . <sssss> my cat is due for a checkup soon so i may be using their services again shortly , because i was please with my visit , and roi has been doing great since the surgery , healed quickly and never winced in pain . 
4		driving back to my parents after spending the day in sedona , we were all very hungry and wanted to splurge for some tasty chinese food . <sssss> we tried the orange chicken -lrb- good but not at all what we 're used to -rrb- the veggie chow mein , mongolian beef and s&s chicken ; all of which were similar to what we know in seattle and all very good . <sssss> the best thing about this place was that our order was out in 5 minutes ... no lie ! <sssss> the service was impeccable and very friendly . <sssss> the bathrooms were also very clean and overall the restaurant looked to be the same . <sssss> we visit my parents in surprise a couple times a year so i 'm sure we 'll be back and seeing as there are n't too many decent if not good restaurants in the area ... it 's a must go ! 
4		excellent ride , it 's kind of a mix between a social booze cruise and mutual of omaha 's wild kingdom . <sssss> twenty dollars scores you an a leisurely ninety minute tour through a man made arizona canyon lake with some stunning views . <sssss> wild life abounds as we observed bald eagles soaring overhead , various species of ducks quacking along , and were told of bighorn sheep , bobcats , and even mountain lions being present in past excursions . <sssss> the captain gives it that marlin perkins feel and injects quite a lot of interesting facts along with some humor into the trip but is not overbearing as to ruin the relative serenity of the overall experience . <sssss> we also got to see a few guys on water skis putting on an excellent ` hey ! <sssss> i am an idiot ! ' <sssss> show along with a 1966 amphicar model 770 -lrb- is it a car ? <sssss> is it a boat ? -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> it was definitely a good time and worth doing again . 
4		i love this place ! <sssss> the pizza is fantastic , thin crust with fresh toppings . <sssss> i also love the macaroni and cheese which is made with giant shell pasta . <sssss> so good ! 
4		seriously good sandwiches . <sssss> i had an a wreck sub with roast beef , turkey , salami , and ham for five bucks you kidding me ! <sssss> added bacon for $ 1.25 and it was some of the best bacon i 've ever had . <sssss> definitely worth it . <sssss> added all the veggies included their delicious hot peppers . <sssss> it 's served warm and toasted and is super delicious . <sssss> really go try it for yourself . 
4		dim sum mmm mmm good ! <sssss> my wife and i had to pretty much roll out of there ... we ate way too much ! <sssss> the biggest problem was that you keep ordering more and more as the carts roll by . <sssss> we 've been back a few times for dim sum and will be going back again ! 
4		good breakfast spot 
4		this place reminds me a little like the italian restaurant , pompeii , in chicago where my roommate and i ordered food from there quite a bit . <sssss> we ordered carry out from here . <sssss> i wonder since i was visiting her here in phoenix , she thought about getting us food from this place . <sssss> i did deviate from what we typically order and got the salami , turkey , ham and mozzarella panini . <sssss> it had a red wine vinaigrette that made it taste really good . <sssss> the ingredients appear to be fresh and well packaged . <sssss> the prices seemed average to me from chicago standards , but unsure if it 's pricey for the area here . <sssss> i would n't mind trying out some other items here . 
4		went on a monday during happy hour . <sssss> it was slow but the minimal staff could n't handle it . <sssss> i saw a couple sit at the bar and leave after about 5 minutes of not being greeted or contacted at all . <sssss> 3-4 staff off duty were hanging out at the end of the bar . <sssss> that 's the bad . <sssss> the good was the pizza and the kitchen manager , david . <sssss> he came to the rescue and took excellent care of us . <sssss> he turned what would have been a pretty negative experience into a good one . <sssss> he made up for everything the staff lacked and whipped up a great pizza ! <sssss> i 'll be coming back for sure ! 
4		on recommendation of others ; i decided to try z 's greek . <sssss> passed by several times ; but never thought to venture in . <sssss> i 'm sure glad i did ; had the gyro plate ; the food was delicious ; and the food very plentiful . <sssss> my roommate had the lamb souvlaki platter and it was really great ! <sssss> the side salad was awesome with a lot of feta cheese ; and a wonderful salad dressing . <sssss> will definitely be back ! 
4		i 've been a premier silver member for the past few years and just got extended till 2020 so i consider myself a fan of the place . <sssss> the location is so convenient for me plus i 've had nothing but great experiences with the staff . <sssss> if i 've had any problems with an item there 's no questions asked and they take it back . 
4		i went with my young son last night to check out the new menu , and i loved it ! <sssss> i ordered the chickpea curry over brown rice , spicy . <sssss> it was absolutely delicious , and is alone a good reason to return . <sssss> we also ordered the lentil patty appetizer , which was good , although not my favorite . <sssss> they serve a `` masala '' black iced tea which was unusual and delicious . <sssss> my son ordered from the kids meal -lrb- a backup , just in case -rrb- , and he chose baked chicken fingers which came with a side of fruit cocktail and a full-sized drink . <sssss> overall , the food was a modern , healthy version of my favorites , with courteous and attentive customer service in a beautifully decorated space . <sssss> four stars because i want to try more of their menu , make sure service and quality stay consistent , and because they were inexplicably playing a steve miller band greatest hits album during our visit . <sssss> i want to fly like an eagle , to the sea ... 
4		i went into this place weirdly expecting pauly shore to pop out exclaiming , `` welcome tuu the luuving huut '' please god no . <sssss> when this was supreme master i knew i was in for a long wait and this is still the case , a party had to get their own menus they grew too impatient . <sssss> do n't expect to be out of here in 45 minutes or under an hour for that matter . <sssss> vegetarian meals should n't be this hard to find and they are not , this is just another option to consider if you are on this side of town . <sssss> i have found some items on the menu i can cross off , and some i will always make my regular rotation . <sssss> service is friendly but be sure to snatch your desserts before you hit the table , otherwise they will be gone by the time you finish your meal . <sssss> cheesecake is very popular and is frequently sold out . <sssss> just thought you should know that , before the vultures swarm . <sssss> the heaven rice rolls $ 4.00 are okay if you are a fan of the rice paper wrapping , although i did not like the cold , rubbery , not too flavorful texture . <sssss> the peanut sauce was a compliment to every dish however , and could go on anything -lrb- it is supposed to come with a hoisin sauce -rrb- . <sssss> the moo shu vegetables $ 6.95 came differently than how they are supposed to on the menu , it came wrapped tightly again with a rice paper instead of in a wheat moo shu skin . <sssss> not acceptable . <sssss> the sweet and sour divine $ 8.50 -lrb- rice separately white $ 1.00 , brown $ 1.25 -rrb- was delicious , a true vegan `` junk food '' delight . <sssss> soy protein , pineapple , carrots , and homemade s&s sauce which i thought they gave me a little too much of but that 's okay . <sssss> it looked like real chicken , tasted like real chicken , and although i have been a vegetarian for 8 years , it was reminiscent of the real thing and recreated that memory for me of eating some s&s chicken . <sssss> my mom who is not in anyway shape or form a vegan , was shocked by the taste of the dish -lrb- she was a butcher for many years -rrb- . <sssss> the guru curry $ 7.50 is made like a thin thai curry so do n't expect a thick indian or chinese curry . <sssss> it is soupy but it is very good and is served with a crusty loaf of bread . <sssss> it is composed of : curry , taro , carrots , potatoes , gluten , tofu . <sssss> the small trick she offered us about their water is that they cut up a bunch of oranges and put it in the ice water . <sssss> the macadamia carrot cake $ 3.95 could have been better if it was n't so dried out by the refrigerator . <sssss> it was a delicious cake but they need to throw those out and replace them . <sssss> with : coconut , carrots , turbinado , sugar , macadamia nuts , spices , coconut cream topping . <sssss> please men in the back who kept farting ; i know vegans have a lot of fiber running through the digestive tract at an astronomical rate but farting in a full restaurant is in poor taste . <sssss> please excuse yourself and go to the bathroom and fart to your heart 's content or take it outside . <sssss> * disclaimer-none of the people pictured were the purveyors of the gas . <sssss> all items are 100 % vegan , all entrees are under $ 10 , all of their delicious organic juices , milks and teas are $ 3.50-5 .00 . <sssss> it gets busy on weekends and with the already long wait , prepare to wait or come early . <sssss> might be hard to pass up but it is right across from chuy 's , and right in the same parking lot as desert jade . 
4		the best mexican place i have found so far . <sssss> this is n't a favorite of mine , but it is better the serano 's , garcia 's , and macayo 's . <sssss> the offer the usual fare and the prices are like everyone elses . <sssss> there is n't anything to really write home about , but it is better than any other place i have been to -lrb- above average -rrb- . <sssss> i am searching for a great mexican restaurant . <sssss> if anyone has one they love , please share it with me . 
4		i really , really like this place a lot . <sssss> this is yet another restaurant where the surroundings and location do n't necessarily say `` this place is excellent , '' but sometimes you have to jump in there . <sssss> or , take the advice of a friend , which is how i found this place . <sssss> the dining room has always been quite clean , maybe made to feel moreso with the metal tables -lrb- they look like polished aluminum or stainless steel , very modern looking -rrb- , and there is some decent art hanging on the walls . <sssss> the restrooms are situated such that you can see into the kitchen area if you head over to them , which to me says that the owner has some pride in the cleanliness there as well . <sssss> the food can be slightly salty now and then , but only if you 're really looking to taste the salt . <sssss> i wonder if this might be due to variations in the ingredients going into the dishes , but either way i never did run into a `` this is too salty '' situation . <sssss> i 'd love to point out one or two dishes that stood out , but i think they all did . <sssss> several times did we grab shrimp , chicken , beef , curry , and soup dishes to dine in or take out , and it was always great . <sssss> definitely worth checking out . 
4		walnut chicken sandwich is my favorite here ! <sssss> and it comes with a chocolate chip cookie !! <sssss> awesome : -rrb- 
4		new management has improved the quality of the pizza . <sssss> had one last night and it was excellent . <sssss> will go back and try rest of menu for sure . <sssss> thanks for sticking out the summer . <sssss> gold canyon has few places to eat we need to support those that are here . 
4		so it 's been years since i have been to a paradise bakery ! <sssss> working at the mall will do that to you . <sssss> stopped in sunday for some shopping fuel with my mom & sis . <sssss> i had the sour dough bread bowl w the fire roasted tomato soup they also had posole which i thought was interesting . <sssss> mom and sis had sandwiches chicken walnut and the albacore . <sssss> i had never been to a stand alone pbc before it was a little chaotic maybe because it was mothers day and the line was out the door ?! <sssss> they had their bottled water ads out and proceeds go to free arts of az http://www.freeartsaz.org/ just so happens to be my fav charity they only had a small basket full and they were warm not on ice , the cashier suggested the cold dasani water instead eh we drank it warm anyway then went down to paciugo to cool off . <sssss> all in all i am glad we are getting some healthier chains up here as opposed to the olive garden , applbee 's , tgif , logans accross the street i will be back ! 
4		this ` bucks is right down the street from my house , so whenever i get a caffeine fix , i take a little walk to my local starbucks . <sssss> it does suck that this , pei wei and sidebar took over the fierce emerald lounge , but business is business . <sssss> anyway , in no time at all the staff knew my name and my drink . <sssss> does that mean i go there too much or they 're just that good ? <sssss> i vote for the latter , and on top of it these guys know the right way to make my drink . <sssss> i 've tried to explain my drink to other baristas in other stores from phoenix to la to vegas to san francisco -lrb- jeez i visit starbucks too much -rrb- , and they never get it quite right . <sssss> also the place is usually spotless , even when it 's crowded , which makes for a great hang out spot . 
4		perfect way to start the day !! <sssss> make sure to get there earlier in the day for the best bagel selection . 
4		5th and wine is becoming quite the old town hot spot . <sssss> just 6 weeks since its doors opened , it seems to be quite popular for dinner and drinks alike . <sssss> there was quite the crowd saturday night , which made it loud , but it had a very fun atmosphere and is definitely a good place to go for wine with friends . <sssss> everyone i saw seemed to be having fun . <sssss> the space is huge , having two dining areas and a bar . <sssss> if you have a big group , no problem , they can definitely accommodate larger parties . <sssss> the decor is really fun and classy - red or brown leather chairs at all the tables , lovely classic furniture -lrb- couches , arm chairs -rrb- in the sitting areas , polished wood rafters , great art on the walls , and a very cool bar area showing off their collection of wines . <sssss> the service was very attentive and friendly . <sssss> we actually had two people serving us , and received wonderful recommendations and information on the food and wine . <sssss> our host/server introduced us to both the sommelier and the chef , and they were a pleasure . <sssss> i thought the wine list was great , and has a nice range of wines and prices for both glasses and bottles . <sssss> all the wines are $ 5 a glass until 6pm , which makes it an outstanding choice for lunch and happy hour . <sssss> we decided on a smooth tempranillo and were very pleased with the selection . <sssss> i found the food a bit hit or miss . <sssss> we sampled the mixed olives -lrb- i love olives -rrb- , which were really good , and had the cheese platter with goat cheese , white cheddar , and grana padano , served with pistachios , dried fig , and toasted bread . <sssss> the cheeses were excellent and i could have eaten that all night . <sssss> we tried four bruschetta , and the only one i really enjoyed was the mozzarella burrata with basil and grape tomatoes . <sssss> you really can not go wrong with burrata - so good ! <sssss> i had issues with the other three : the hummus was tasty , but a little drippy and unexpectedly spicy ; the red/yellow peppers were bland and the goat-cheese was overpowered with garlic ; finally the prosciutto , fig , & mascarpone , normally my favorite , was disappointing . <sssss> maybe i was unimpressed by the bruschetta because i went to postino earlier this week , but i do believe they could jazz up the ingredients a bit . <sssss> we also had the pesto pasta which was non-traditional and creamy , but tasty . <sssss> 5th and wine is really a concept in progress . <sssss> they are trying to sell themselves as a trendy place for ` comfort food . ' <sssss> i think they are currently in the midst of an identity crisis , and just really need to commit . <sssss> it is hard to be both a neighborhood diner and a wine bar . <sssss> if you are going for comfort food , where is the macaroni & cheese , or the meatloaf , or the chicken noodle soup ? <sssss> if you want to be an accessible , yet trendy wine bar , then maybe stick to lighter dinner fare ? <sssss> i am confident they will figure it out as more customers let they know what they like . <sssss> i think they have a casual loungy wine bar vibe that definitely suits the decor and most of the menu -lrb- as opposed to a more upscale and elitist feel at wine bars like kazimierz -rrb- . <sssss> i will definitely be back to have more wine and see what direction they decided to go with the menu . <sssss> get some friends together for happy hour and check out 5th and wine ! 
4		out of our 3 people : 2 - 4 star votes 1 - 3 star vote we came here on a busy sunday evening . <sssss> overall the food was very good and generally better than you will find at a buffet . <sssss> they had a wide variety and most dishes were full and fresh . <sssss> the facilities were old and dingy , the bathrooms were bad and needing repairs . <sssss> i was impressed with the sushi bar , salad bar , and the crab legs -lrb- they actually had meat on them ! -rrb- <sssss> . 
4		great looking mall . <sssss> not a large group of shops in the mall , but surrounded by many others . <sssss> nice to have shopping , theatre , and variety of restaurants together in this outdoor setting 
4		ok , so i havent spent a lot of time in maricopa since i moved out here , so this part of the city is rather new to me . <sssss> recently , i found myself down here , and wanted to grab some breakfast . <sssss> my date suggested that teakwoods had some good food , and that i should try it out . <sssss> upon entering , i liked what i saw . <sssss> yes , its a traditional `` grill and tavern '' in that sense , in regards to how its designed , but seems to cater to a breakfast crowd as well . <sssss> we both ended up ordering omlettes , and they were super tasty ! <sssss> big portions ! <sssss> yumyumyum . <sssss> service was wonderful too . <sssss> i would return here again in a heartbeat . 
4		this place was close to the timeshare we are staying while on vacation . <sssss> we wanted a homestyle breakfast and found the breakfast joynt . <sssss> my wife had eggs benedict with off the bone ham . <sssss> it was fantastic . <sssss> we split a 1/2 order of biscuits and gravy . <sssss> as a southern bred i expect really good biscuits and gravy . <sssss> these were good but not stellar . <sssss> for my breakfast i had the basic with thick cut bacon . <sssss> all items were very fresh and tasty . <sssss> i 'd recommend this place ! 
4		okay , new place . <sssss> it really is n't a detour , it 's much more high end . <sssss> food is geared towards a more healthy sect . <sssss> drinks are great , save on appetizers during happy hour . <sssss> we drank for several hours , ate and got out rather cheap . <sssss> service was great but the place was about 1/4 / full . <sssss> food is freshly prepared and most importantly the wings are fairly good , grilled but good . <sssss> sandwiches were also all fresh ingrediants , nothing to knock . <sssss> nice new place and i hope it succeeds . <sssss> bartender was great , drinks were good . 
4		i did write an update giving 5 stars but then we went tonight and i had to take it back . <sssss> we ordered an appetizer , salad , and sandwich to share plus a burger for our two year old . <sssss> it all came out at the same time . <sssss> that is a huge pet peeve of mine at restaurants , our table was so full we had no room for our plates , we had to eat the hot sandwich first , then the hot appetizer -lrb- which was almost cold by that time -rrb- and then the salad . <sssss> and try to keep the hot plates away from our kiddo . <sssss> not cool . <sssss> how difficult is it for them to understand , one dish at a time in a timely manner unless otherwise specified . <sssss> still love it there , next time we will have to ask and be more specific . 
4		came for sunday brunch awhile ago and loved it . <sssss> as does the entire phoenix population of course so this is nothing new . <sssss> nothing i can say other than great ! 
4		seems like there is a bunch of folks on here that got a wedgie just before they went in , maybe a trip to sensations before your next visit ? <sssss> it 's just next door ! <sssss> this place is an excellent excuse of an irish bar . <sssss> it is too big and airy for the pub name . <sssss> to be fair , i do avoid this place on fri and sat nights , most of the other nights though it is a great , fun place to hang out . <sssss> they often have music , you can check the internet for details -lrb- sic -rrb- . <sssss> one of my favorite aspects of this place is that inside and the back porch are two completely different feels . <sssss> i really like both , but prefer the porch at night unless there is good music . <sssss> very chill and same stuff on tap and plate the drinks here are expensive , but not necessarily over-priced . <sssss> the guiness is thicker here , i think it is the imported kind . <sssss> they have an excellent selection of liquors , especially whiskey . <sssss> their prices are better for expensive irish whiskey than other bars in the valley . <sssss> the food i 've had is fusion irish and very good . <sssss> the beef and guiness boxty is heavy and delicious . <sssss> the salads are inventive . <sssss> snacks are also good and high quality , the irish chips come with two great sauces and are a great snack over many drinks . <sssss> go on a thursday or sunday night for dinner and drinks . <sssss> i think there is an open mic on tuesdays 
4		we 've been here a few times and we love all the fresh ingredients . <sssss> the pizza is good when you eat it fresh but if you like to eat your pizza cold then you 'll be biting into hard dough . <sssss> their nutella pizza is good . <sssss> take a menu and check out their menu and hours for specials . 
4		i 'm a big starbucks fan , mainly because it 's convenient and i am a rewards member . <sssss> this location : the customer service is not the best , and i do n't like any of the baristas too much ... other than the really attractive boy that works sundays . <sssss> that being said , it 's still the best location in my book -lrb- other than the kierland starbucks -rrb- because of seating and the wonderful drive through ! <sssss> it 's also open at 430am , earlier than other locations , which is nice since i leave for work so early some days . <sssss> their wifi rocks too it 's super fast . 
4		its definitely seen better days , and its sort of an acquired taste , but as far as blue-collar watering holes go , this is is probably one of the best near asu . <sssss> happy hour is when people start showing up -lrb- the smoking patio is in the shade -rrb- and it is easy to get stuck here way past sundown . <sssss> its also great for various sporting events and st pattys . <sssss> i probably wouldnt take a date here , but the drink prices are just ridiculous , and as long as you have a strategy to get out of there before eleven -lrb- or before it rains -rrb- i think you will do ok . 
4		i love this place , i have tried several things on the menu and have never had something i did n't like . <sssss> the seafood is fresh , and there are a lot of options for preparation . <sssss> if you are unfamiliar with something , dive in and try it ! <sssss> plus : the servers are always friendly . <sssss> food arrives fast and hot i have been there a couple dozen times , and there is always something i have n't tried yet . <sssss> minus : the music can be really loud . <sssss> being a nerd , i started the decibel meter app on my phone - it reached 101 decibels at times ! <sssss> i found this on yahoo answers : `` 100 decibels , equivalent to a chain saw , pneumatic drill , printing plant , jackhammer , speeding express train , some car horns at five meters , farm tractor , riveting machine , some noisy subways -lsb- about 20 feet -rsb- . '' <sssss> so yeah , the other reviewers are not exaggerating when they say it 's loud in there . <sssss> the lighting is super bright fluorescent bulb style . <sssss> these 2 things combine to make this not the place for a relaxing dinner after a long day at work . <sssss> it 's more of an adventure , so find something you have n't tried yet , shout out your order and enjoy that michelada ! 
4		i eat here at least once a month . <sssss> the staff is really friendly and their food is always good . 
4		their angus burger is incredible . <sssss> so is their smoked chicken chile relleno . <sssss> according to their website : `` poblano pepper stuffed with a seasoned filling of smoked chicken , chopped pecans , apricots , jack cheese and raisins . <sssss> served with green chile mole , roasted tomato cream , tejas rice and black beans . '' <sssss> let me tell ya , it 's so worth it ! <sssss> the atmosphere is cool , too , although it gets a bit noisy fridays around 6 p.m. . <sssss> the lighting is dim and it 's conveniently located off mill ave , so you can always spring for gelato after wards , or just wander the street , checking out stores and people watching . 
4		ate here in 2008 i 'm sure it 's changed but the food was great and good for meeting . <sssss> they where very accommodating for a large party . <sssss> was a little expensive for az . 
4		good dumplings , they 're huge ! <sssss> it 's a meal in itself . <sssss> stir fry noodles are great . <sssss> i like the seafood better than the xo beef . <sssss> didnt really taste any xo sauce , seems like they just added a bit of chili oil and some whole fried chilis -lrb- like the ones that come in kung pao -rrb- noodles with minced pork - i was skeptical at first because it didnt look promising based off the photos i 've seen but it was really good . <sssss> good flavor . <sssss> beef stew - will not order again . <sssss> beef was tough n chewy , not edible . <sssss> broth was bland . 
4		very good pizza and wings ! 
4		i love this place . <sssss> always fairly busy . <sssss> i ca n't resist the pizza muffins , and now they have a few new types i need to try.usually get pizza , so i ca n't vouch for much else . <sssss> very nice non chain place . 
4		you get what you paid for !!! <sssss> do not expect amc or other big theater class and style in a theater that runs slightly older movies for $ 3 . <sssss> you do not get the latest movies running at amc or other big corporate theater chains . <sssss> what you get are movies that have been recently removed from the big theater chains . <sssss> for $ 3 it is not bad at all . <sssss> do n't expect perfect seats , or sound or video quality . <sssss> but if you do n't mind a slight degradation in your movie-going experience , its great . <sssss> my wife and i go there mainly for movies that we have missed at the amc and need to be watched on a big screen i.e. those with action/thrill/special effects which do not have the same feel at home . <sssss> often the movies start right on time -lrb- unlike other theaters where the ads go on and on -rrb- . <sssss> also , the schedules are online -lrb- + -rrb- . <sssss> also , there are plenty of bugs . <sssss> so cover up or use a bug spray before you go : -rrb- 
4		i took my car in for an oil change it only took 20 minutes i was expecting to be there atleast an hour . <sssss> thanks guys . 
4		although my office is across the street and i 've been there for years , this is the first time i visited . <sssss> the decor inside is precious , reminded me of my honeymoon in kauai with bamboo strips everywhere . <sssss> lots of bright , happy colors . <sssss> i shared a hawaiian breeze w splenda with the wife and our 7 yr old had jetty junior . <sssss> we loved the drink - only 174 calories and very tasty . 
4		great place sunday evenings to relax and finally slow down after a busy weekend . <sssss> happy hour with carlsbad mussels and shrimp adriatico , $ 6 each , with half price wines as bookends . <sssss> nate took care of us , even comp ` ing some drinks when the apps were late . <sssss> our local fav ! 
4		love me some acai ! <sssss> thrive has got a great little store front with catchy slogans and what not . <sssss> the menu is awesome and i definitely suggest the green bowl . <sssss> i 'm not sure how i feel about the set up with the kitchen in the back and all but i 'll forgive them for taking so long on an acai bowl because it was really really good . <sssss> i may try the gluten free granola next time because whatever they use regularly is quite light and crunchy . <sssss> i also think they should potentially get vita-mix 's or industrial type blenders rather than the little bullets i saw them using . <sssss> i had a huge chunk of acai on the bottom of my bowl & it just seems like blenders would be more useful honestly . 
4		this is my husband 's go to place . <sssss> the sales staff is always willing to talk bikes with you and i 've never felt out of place going in . <sssss> i 'm a large women and sometimes people can be standoffish but there they encourage you to take the steps to riding a bike . <sssss> today they even helped fix my husband 's wheel . 
4		friendly staff , rooms have couches and fridge . <sssss> great pool 
4		really ca n't go wrong at just about any cheesecake factory but this one is exceptionally reliable . <sssss> we frequent this location once or twice a month and almost always have perfect service and great food . 
4		ikea how i love you so . <sssss> your prices are reasonable and most of your items are easy to put together , and some are a little more complicated . <sssss> your clearance can be hit or miss , but when you hit , you can grab the motherload of items for cheap and already assembled . <sssss> just do n't make the mistake i did and buy a chest of drawers from clearance only to realize that it wo n't fit in your car . <sssss> luckily for me i was able to return the item , seeing as i had never left the property . <sssss> next time , i will have to bring a friend with a truck or a larger car . 
4		checked out d'lish with gabi and crew . <sssss> really cool space with super-efficient drive-thru and friendly staff . <sssss> i sampled the `` breakfast buzz , '' which is a delicious smoothie made with espresso , nestle good morning mix , banana , chocolate , and peanut butter . <sssss> the owner claims the breakfast buzz has restorative properties for those suffering from hangovers . <sssss> the coffee was also excellent . <sssss> i 'm 99 % sure d'lish sources its beans from echo espresso on the west side . <sssss> bonus : you can buy 160 ounces of coffee -lrb- in a disposable insulated box -rrb- for 20 bucks . <sssss> that might be enough to get your group through a powerpoint presentation or two . 
4		this really is the only gay bar you could take your mother to -lrb- although i do n't know why you 'd want to go drinking with your mom -rrb- , or any of your straight friends . <sssss> it 's tame , it looks classy , and it 's pretty much the opposite of the seediness and lameness that your straight friends probably expect out of a gay bar . <sssss> just do n't go on any day other than friday or saturday , or you 're probably gon na walk right in the middle of a drag show -lrb- too often at this bar in my opinon -rrb- . <sssss> the inside bar is cool if you can get a seat , but tends to be too loud if you are n't drunk yet . <sssss> the back patio is my favorite area when the weather is nice ... you can watch the crowd and videos and hang out with larger groups of friends . <sssss> the miami dance club is a little pointless ; it 's too small to actually dance , and is a really awkward space that would probably make a better lounge . <sssss> the bottom line is that amsterdam is a great place to start out the evening on a saturday , then head to burn for some dancing later in the evening -lrb- it 's close enough to walk from here -rrb- and let loose . <sssss> if it 's just you and a bunch of straight friends -lrb- or conservative gay friends -rrb- , stay here . 
4		after reading the reviews , i have to admit , i have n't tried the cupcakes . <sssss> i have been there many times for a scone and coffee though and the service is impeccable . <sssss> the only reason i give it 4 stars is the atmosphere , well , the chairs and tables . <sssss> i prefer something a little more comfortable and plush , but if you are into industrialish decor , this is for you . 
4		i loved the restaurant itself but honestly i was not completely impressed with the food . <sssss> i like city hall better for steak but prefer the staff at ruth 's chris . <sssss> my husband and i both had the filet and garlic mashed potatoes and both were just ok . <sssss> we were not thrilled with our dinner or our desserts . <sssss> the service though was so beyond fabulous and enough to make me want to return and try something else on the menu . <sssss> customer service is everything to me ! 
4		fast quick and reliable for people in a hurry . <sssss> got the new honey sesame chicken and mushroom chicken . <sssss> good however the tables need to be wiped down more frequently . <sssss> staff is courteous and nice and was greeted with smiles ! 
4		quick , easy , good looking nails - done for a quick , but still high quality mani / pedi , this is the place to go . <sssss> i usually go to my regular nail lady in a traditional salon , but she was booked , so i opted for desert nails , based on the good reviews . <sssss> i made an appointment , because i 'm ocd and feel the need to be organized and in control . <sssss> but i really did n't need one . <sssss> most people just walked in and proceeded directly to a nail station . <sssss> this place has lots of nail stations and technicians . <sssss> there are at least a dozen pedicure stations and they 're nice with elevated comfy chairs . <sssss> there are probably at least twenty manicure stations . <sssss> they 're a little crowded together , but that was n't such a big deal because their manicures are fast , no muss no fuss . <sssss> it 's fairly quiet too because most people do n't talk much since the technicians are asian and do n't speak much english . <sssss> that 's fine with me , it gives me a little time to relax and not have to worry about carrying on a conversation . <sssss> you should know they try to upgrade their regular services with upgrades . <sssss> for example , upgrades to the normal pedicure include a sugar scrub exfoliation to legs and feet and also a callus reducing lotion . <sssss> since my feet take a beating , i was happy to pay the extra fee for a better end result . <sssss> desert nails is a good value and also a nice way to relax with minimal conversation , so you leave there with great looking nails without the pressure to carry on a newsy conversation with your technician . 
4		order the house special chicken and crab puffs ! <sssss> they are awesome ! 
4		i had a very yummy lunch yesterday . <sssss> i opted for the pork adovada ? <sssss> i think that 's what it was called . <sssss> very tasty . <sssss> my friend ordered their spinach salad w strawberries and pine nuts and that looked super tasty . <sssss> i have two complaints : the ceiling and the seating arrangements . <sssss> the ceiling is really yucky and the air vents are surrounded by black stain . <sssss> it makes you wonder when the last time they cleaned the filters to make the air stain the ceiling like that . <sssss> and all of the crusty yellow spots crumbling away ? <sssss> ew . <sssss> the seats , way uncomfortable !!! <sssss> really old chairs w no tush cushion and no booths . <sssss> i think it 's time for an upgrade ! <sssss> and lastly , it would be nice to see some more friendly lunch prices - we split the bill down the middle and it came out to $ 16 each , that 's a bit high . <sssss> i wo n't be returning for lunch but i would go again for dinner ... maybe . <sssss> when i think about sitting in those awful chairs i give it a second thought . 
4		visited for lunch . <sssss> not a huge dining area , but we just beat the rush . <sssss> had the empanadas appetizer . <sssss> it was pretty good . <sssss> i had the green chile burger with the sweet potato chile fries . <sssss> the burger was tasty but it could have been a little spicier . <sssss> the fries were sweet , but not too sweet . <sssss> husband had the pernil torta . <sssss> he really liked it . <sssss> prices were reasonable . <sssss> our waitress was friendly , informative about the menu and took care of us . <sssss> i actually prefer fuego cityscape over fuego tacos and fuego bistro . 
4		i visited lake pleasant in april 2012 and rented a boat from scorpion bay boat rentals . <sssss> the staff was terrific , they made the paperwork quick and were easy to work with . <sssss> i called around and their prices were the best i found and they have nice boats -lrb- sea ~ rays -rrb- . <sssss> they have a restaurant on the dock that has awesome views and good food - what 's not to like about this place . <sssss> jerrell stark redondo beach , ca 
4		been here 20 + times , always good . <sssss> some dishes are better than others , but maybe thats just personal taste preferences . <sssss> always clean , nice staff , fastidious bussers . 
4		drove by ; never stopped until about 2 months ago ... a huge fan now !!! <sssss> the biscuits & gravy , the pancakes , the muffalata sandwich ; yum , yum , yum ... will definately be back on a regular basis ... 
4		i have been going to this uncle sam 's location prior to the peoria & scottsdale locations ever opening and i have to say , the food at this location is heads and tales above the other 2 . <sssss> we are closer to the peoria location but the service and food are hit or miss , always . <sssss> now on to the shea location . <sssss> hmmm , the food , hot , cheesy , greasy , fried goodness . <sssss> you ca n't go wrong with the cheesesteak , order it with fried onions and a mix of the vinegary hot peppers and the briny sweet peppers . <sssss> . <sssss> they have a 1/4 of a sandwich on the bail out menu but order the half or whole to take home for the next day . <sssss> . <sssss> even better . <sssss> beer battered onion rings are top notch as are the breaded fried zucchini . <sssss> both come with bangin ' ranch , we always need more . <sssss> i am not a big fan of their pizza , but the calzone , that 's another story . <sssss> awesome cheesy , saucy goodness . <sssss> when i 'm in the mood for a cold sandwich i always go with the italian supreme , but if you are ordering to go and you get the cold sandwich ask for the italian dressing on the side , you will end up with a soggy mess . <sssss> a tasty mess , but still a mess . <sssss> the only reason that i do n't give the shea uncle sam 's a 5 star rating is they only serve pepsi products and i am a big , big coke drinker , rather die of thirst than drink a pepsi sort of thing . <sssss> . <sssss> they do have great ice tea though , just ask for extra lemon if it 's your forte ' . 
4		the big fat greek has zesty and flavorful food at a fairly reasonable price . <sssss> i have gone here for dinner and lunch time . <sssss> the ambiance to this place would be great for a dinner date . <sssss> i have tried only their chicken dishes , but it meets my standards in comparison to greek food in la. . <sssss> i usually order the plate , which comes with a delicious greek salad and seasoned fresh potatoes . <sssss> the service is very attentive and caring . <sssss> i felt like i got water or drinks every 15 minutes refilled . 
4		reviews here had me worried . <sssss> but i wanted to take friends to this phoenix icon before the symphony . <sssss> fantastic green corn tamale . <sssss> salsa good . <sssss> margarita pitcher a little strong , but tasty ! <sssss> i had n't eaten here in 20 years since i used to work downtown . <sssss> so close to all the action when you have a downtown event . <sssss> go if you have n't been . 
4		this is a great mall that offers great store selection and easy window shopping opportunities . <sssss> its family friendly and during the summer months , the splash pad is always a kid favorite ! 
4		yum ! <sssss> this is another place up in n. scottsdale worth trying . <sssss> their burgers are tasty and cooked perfectly ! <sssss> fries are n't much to rave about , but if you need fries go where they serve sweet potato fries . <sssss> i can appreciate places where they do n't try to do the fusion thing and stick to what works -lrb- though i love fusions ! -rrb- <sssss> i 've had dessert here before and it 's a dessert lovers dessert for sure -- so sweet mmm ! <sssss> they have happy hour which i have n't ever attended , but it 's definitely a tryout ! <sssss> ambience is low key/loud steak house feel . <sssss> yeah right - loud and low ; how 's that work -- trust me it works : -rrb- 
5		i travel alot and have to try and watch what i eat ... so this place ... who knew ? <sssss> has calorie counts , will custom make what you want ... and is pretty good on the wallet . 
5		this place is so stinking cute , you should definitely pop by . <sssss> i was lured in by the smell when i was in the area on a saturday morning and was greeted by the owner and her lovely daughter . <sssss> this family is so sweet and they let me sample a few flavors . <sssss> i 've been to other gourmet popcorn shops in nyc but this was the first i 've seen in az. . <sssss> they had tons of crazy flavors like strawberry and blueberry mojito . <sssss> i ended up buying two medium-size bags of caramel and garlic parmesan , under $ 10 total ! <sssss> definitely recommend . 
5		last night , i had originally planned to go to the greene house to celebrate a friend 's birthday dinner . <sssss> an hour beforehand , they called to notify me that they had a last - minute water heater issue , and while they could n't accommodate us that night , they would gladly comp our dinner at their partner restaurant next door , north . <sssss> what a stand-up restaurant ! <sssss> they called north to change our reservations for us and make sure we had a nice table by the window for our birthday celebration . <sssss> we greatly appreciated their immediate responsiveness , responsibilty , and generosity . <sssss> thanks for your integrity and outstanding customer service ! <sssss> i will definitely come back ! 
5		big thanks to yelp for giving away free tickets to a friend who invited me to see fiddler on the roof . <sssss> fantastic !! <sssss> i have never before been into musicals , but this was fabulous . <sssss> have i said how fantastic it was ?! <sssss> i truly enjoyed myself . <sssss> thanks robyn ! <sssss> gammage auditorium is a great place . <sssss> easy to get to and i do n't think there is a bad spot to sit . <sssss> if you have to go to the bathroom , wait till after the show . 
5		when a friend and i were talking , one thing we both agreed on @ lgo ; wings . <sssss> bleu cheese and ranch are both amazing . <sssss> pizza is incredible as well ! <sssss> made a great date night the other day . <sssss> keep your shorts on for parking tho ! 
5		great first impression !! <sssss> i called to place a to-go order and although they literally were closing in ten min , the gentleman on the phone was super cool & acted as though it was hours earlier . <sssss> there was absolutely no hint in his voice of annoyance at the last minute order , as so many restaurant workers would have displayed . <sssss> i can not express how accommodating he was on the phone , it was such a relief after having just gotten home from the airport . <sssss> exceptional food , had the chicken pita , tzatsiki , and their signature crazy fries -lrb- with feta ! -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> ca n't wait to return . 
5		barfitness is amazing . <sssss> it 's location is slightly hidden away ... if you go north down 90th street , pass the stop sign and turn in to the first shopping center parking lot on the right side of the street , it 's a little farther down north in unit # 8 . <sssss> the studio is upstairs in a huge beautiful , clean , and bright room with lots of large open windows and views of camelback mountain . <sssss> the owner of the studio is the best their is and puts a whole new spin on barre classes . <sssss> she uses many of the same techniques as daily method and pure barre , however , she adds in what she likes to call `` bursts '' which are quick segments of cardio to get your heart rate up and your blood flowing . <sssss> this studio is also very different from others because they teach and correct you on how to perform the moves in perfect form so your strengthening your muscles the right way and getting the most out of your workout . <sssss> this studio give lots of feedback and help from the instructors and is very personal , which i like ! <sssss> if you are new to barre classes i would recommend going to one of linda 's -lrb- the owner -rrb- classes because she is the best at correcting form and you get a good idea of what her studio 's bar classes are all about . <sssss> if you are more advanced go to jeanie 's class , i guarantee she will kick your butt and leave your muscles shaking like jello after class ... love it ! <sssss> i definitely recommend barfitness to anyone new to the barre classes or experienced barre class groupies looking to take their workout to the next level . <sssss> this studio offers beginning classes and much harder mixed level classes then most studios . <sssss> try this studio out and trust me you will see the results ... quickly ! <sssss> : -rrb- 
5		this place is great ! <sssss> i 'm originally from the chicago area , where gyros places are a dime a dozen and i had been missing it until i found george 's . <sssss> just like the places back home . <sssss> good food , good prices , the staff is as friendly as can be and they even have a small bar if you want a drink with dinner . <sssss> i reccomend a shot of ouzo . <sssss> cheers ! 
5		great atmosphere , knowledgeable wait staff , delicious food , and oh my goodness ... the pumpkin bread pudding is amazing !!! 
5		the margherita pizza is as good or better than four peaks ! <sssss> warning : if you like thin crust , do n't order 7 '' !!!! <sssss> for some reason , they ca n't make the crust thin on those little pizzas . <sssss> all other sizes are very thin and nicely crisp . <sssss> that is the way i like mine ... thin and crisp !! <sssss> this review is only for their 11 '' + thin crust pizza 's . 
5		the only downside is the occasional difficulty getting in and out of the parking lot when they are busy . <sssss> great customer service and exactly what you expect from one of the best starbucks has to offer . 
5		love this place !! <sssss> clean , many flavors , many toppings , and inviting . <sssss> got the red velvet , cheesecake , and birthday cake batter . <sssss> yummy ! <sssss> i topped off with capital crunch , mixed nuts , and brownies . <sssss> so good !!! 
5		i really do n't require a whole lot from a pizza -lrb- or a pizza joint , for that matter -rrb- . <sssss> you do n't have to hand build yourself a big old brick oven , grind your own semolina wheat into flour , milk your own cows for the milk for the mozzarella and press your own olives into super duper virgin olive oil , to impress me . <sssss> i do n't need for to you to have been blessed by oprah or jerry or any of their friends . <sssss> all i need is a well-made and high quality pie , friendly and comfortable surroundings , a glass or two of a nice cab or syrah and friendly service and smiling faces ! <sssss> that 's really pretty simple -lrb- but then , i am a simple man with simple needs ... almost humble , really ... and noted far and wide for my humility and modesty ... i guess i would say `` renowned '' -rrb- . <sssss> but enough about me ... let 's talk pies ! <sssss> grimaldi 's has 'em and a ton of people seem to like 'em ! <sssss> rightly so ... they are terrific ! <sssss> the beautiful carin and i wandered down to grimaldi 's last evening for dinner ... split a caesar , had a pie and couple of glasses of syrah ... sat in the back , near the kitchen and watched the chef 's hand toss the pies and stoke the oven with coal ... all dark wood , red accents and black and white checked table cloths ... just the way a pizza joint should be ! <sssss> time to share our weeks with each other and decide how we want our weekend to look ... a lovely friday evening ritual ... what a great meal and a great way to slide into the weekend ! <sssss> tasty pizza dough , savory sauce and any pretty much any combination of cheese/no-cheese and high quality toppings that you could want , all baked to blistery perfection in the non-homemade coal fired brick oven ! <sssss> for those of us who do n't always like to be told what to do ... we get to customize our pizza -lrb- and the wait staff does n't look at you like you just pooped in your chair for having the temerity to attempt to have a pizza pie the way you want it , instead of the way the pizza pooh-bah thinks you should have it -rrb- ... that 's right ... have it any way you want ! <sssss> and yes , they get busy at grimaldi 's and you might have to wait from time to time , but the pleasant people who work the front of the house go out of their way to make you feel welcome and wanted ! <sssss> * they give you pizza shaped pagers to let you know when they are ready for you , rather than telling you that you have to come find them every hour to find out if you are going be able to eat ; * there are tons of things to do nearby -lrb- within easy walking distance -rrb- if there is a bit of a wait , as well as a terrific and reasonably priced full bar to enhance your appetite ; * they give you reasonably accurate estimates of the wait time , so you can decide what you would like to do -lrb- as opposed to telling you the wait is `` 2 hours '' and then telling you 4 hours later that they have run out of everything and they are done for the night ... too bad for you -rrb- in other words , grimaldi 's operates as a good restaurant should , providing an excellent product and wonderful and friendly service at very reasonable price points ! <sssss> i understand that one 's taste in pizza is subjective and `` who 's best '' is the subject of nearly endless and tedious debate ... i mean really tedious ... i 'm not going be the one to broker peace in our time in the never ending pizza wars . <sssss> for me , grimaldi 's is a slice of contentment , satisfaction and relaxation ... i do n't care who wins the pizza wars , as long as i can get a friday night pie every week or two at grimaldi 's ! 
5		this place never let 's down . <sssss> great service tremendous food . <sssss> the price is amazing for the quality of product . <sssss> i recommend this place to any lover of pho or even someone who has n't tried it yet . <sssss> ca n't get enough of this place . <sssss> probably be back for dinner 
5		went here for dinner while on vacation for spring training . <sssss> food was amazing , service was awesome , overall great experience . <sssss> we shared an antipasto salad , were surprised by a delicious vegetable beef soup that came with dinner , and as entrees we had the cheese ravoli and spaghetti with meatballs . <sssss> really good food and service , we will be back when we visit for spring training next year ! 
5		inta juice is a great place ! <sssss> i have been taking my kids here since they opened . <sssss> i have gotten to know the owners by name -lrb- tom and anita -rrb- . <sssss> they know my daughter by name as she is the one that comes with me most frequently . <sssss> we all like the `` lime your mine '' smoothie as well as the `` fruit kiss '' . <sssss> i agree with merle that i go out of my way to support the nonchain food establishments . <sssss> i get a shot of wheatgrass everytime i go there . <sssss> it has become an acquired taste for me . <sssss> this place is great ! <sssss> if you want a smoothie go here !!! 
5		been to rehab several times this year , i go to scottsdale about once a month to play and i think this will be my new go-to spot ! <sssss> the first time in i sat on the patio ... waited 15 minutes for a waitress , then went and found her and asked for a beer ... never saw her again . <sssss> but i am very glad i went inside and tried again . <sssss> the bartender helped me , apologized for the poor service outside and proceeded to make me a convert ! <sssss> i have been back several times since and the staff and owners are great . <sssss> john and reno the bartenders , as well as denise , one of the owners and a very pretty addition to the place , have all been very friendly and made me feel at home every time . <sssss> the food is great , the atmosphere is relaxed and welcoming . <sssss> absolutely going back ! 
5		i would definitely stay at this hotel again ! <sssss> the room was pretty and the bathroom was spacious and had dual sinks ... shower is roomy with a place to sit . <sssss> the sliding glass door led to our second floor patio with a small table and 2 lounge chairs , overlooking a white bridge with beautiful flowers . <sssss> there are multiple pools and a basketball hoop at the end of one of the pools that was fun to use with my boyfriend . <sssss> the gym here is great ! <sssss> the eliptical has a tv attached and earphones are provided at the desk . <sssss> i participated in 2 pilates classes ; which were enjoyable and had only 1-2 people in each classs ! <sssss> we golfed one day and the course was very fun , pretty , and well kept . 
5		two words : pizza muffins . <sssss> this was one of the first restaurant i tried in arizona when i came out to school . <sssss> as i 'm from chicago , i 'm semi-critical on italian food . <sssss> floridino 's is simply to die for . <sssss> good for broke students on a budget , you can get 6 pizza muffins and a side salad for $ 6 . <sssss> i 've had some of the pasta there too and it 's delicious . <sssss> definitely check it out ! 
5		i bought a sofa last night after researching reviews on yelp for stores in the area . <sssss> reviews were good so i decided to go with them . <sssss> great experience . <sssss> i did n't feel pressured like on a car lot , they helped me find the right size for the room in my home and threw in some pillows that i thought would tie it in to the rest of the decor . <sssss> i 'm kind of new to yelp , but the review system seems to be working so far ! <sssss> great experience even when they were busy with the pre christmas rush ! 
5		super helpful staff . <sssss> glen looked up my part , told me the different pricing , and then switched out the part for me . <sssss> awesome ! 
5		cute local consignment & vintage store ! <sssss> the owner is super friendly and appears to always be working when i come in . <sssss> the store is very bright and clean . <sssss> they sell a wide selection of used brand name clothing and also vintage . <sssss> on my first visit , i found a 1950 's western inspired vintage skirt for what i can only call a steal , because it was missing a button . <sssss> easy fix ! <sssss> most of the brand names are pretty well known and are priced reasonably . <sssss> what i also love love love about this store is how they support the local art scene . <sssss> they sell artwork and merch from many local artists . <sssss> definitely recommend ! <sssss> you 'll probably find a treasure or two . <sssss> : -rrb- 
5		i adore local businesses and strawberry hedgehog is tops in my book . <sssss> who does n't love luxury handmade eco-friendly vegan bath and body products ? <sssss> i first started my addiction at a yelp gets schooled event at whole foods in tucson . <sssss> which i might add that i got hooked up with mega samples . <sssss> i met the owner tracy perkins and she was so bubbly and refreshing . <sssss> bonus , she is a geology instructor and i am a rock hound ... so she is uber cool in my book . <sssss> if you are lucky , you will get to meet her ... follow her fb for demo dates . <sssss> tracy , a vegan , was tired of misleading packaging and took matters into her own hands and created this business and i thank her . <sssss> her soap are like works of art . <sssss> if you have acne , you will love the tea tree rosemary face soap . <sssss> the lemongrass ginger looked so pretty , i wanted to eat it ... it was so pretty i did n't want to use it , but it was worth it . <sssss> i love , love , love the bamboo detox barm charcoal and green tea add to the detoxification process . <sssss> how i dream of being a member of the soap club or even better become one of her soap gnomes ! <sssss> that 's right you can get soap delivered to your door ! <sssss> 3 bars for 12 months is just 72.60 and 1 bar for 3 , 6 , or 12 months is 30 . <sssss> the bars of soap last about a months . <sssss> just imagine the aroma of essential oils filling your bathroom , transforming your shower into a zen like spa ... check her out in az whole food locations or online . 
5		on a hot day , on a cold day . <sssss> pho is the vietnamese version of chicken soup for the soul . <sssss> yes , we live in a climate where 75 % of the year is over 90 degrees . <sssss> but really there are few things as great as the healing properties of a good bowl of pho . <sssss> my fiance and i have been coming here for years - and within the past year - they have really made some improvements . <sssss> they 've redecorated , and improved their patio furniture -lrb- yes , we 've actually eaten pho outside in the middle of summer ! -rrb- <sssss> they 've even gotten new plates/bowls . <sssss> just when we thought they could n't improve they did ! <sssss> tea light cafe is an amazing little vietnamese restaurant located on the cusp of north scottsdale and phoenix . <sssss> location location location : conveniently situated next to the harkins cine capri and buffalo wild wings at the scottsdale 101 plaza - it is a high traffic area . <sssss> perfect to grab a bite before a movie - or , if you are like my fiance and i , perfect to grab a few beers at bww and then head to tea light cafe for some real food . <sssss> for all the positives of the location comes anegative . <sssss> the menu is a bit toned down and you 're not going to find the ultra authentic foods here -lrb- no tripe or tendon ! -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> north scottsdale is n't quite ready for that . <sssss> what you will find is a small menu with all of the essentials you need . <sssss> a fantastic minimalist approach - offer a smaller menu but offer everything on the menu to the level of perfection . <sssss> like clockwork the super friendly owners and employees know our order . <sssss> beef and beefball pho noodle soup for me , vietnamese pork and vermicelli noodles for my fiance , and of course an order of super fresh , light , cool spring rolls to start . <sssss> perfect to combat the heat . <sssss> oh - and a cup for ice tea - because they have some of the most amazing ice tea brews . <sssss> soo refreshing and flavorful you do n't even need sugar ! <sssss> if you decide to split the pho i believe they charge you a split fee . <sssss> but because we always order two entrees - they bring out a small bowl so my fiance and i can share -lrb- the portions are huge and there 's no way i could finish a whole bowl -rrb- . <sssss> a wonderful , fresh , huge meal for about $ 20.00 ! <sssss> and let me tell you - nothing beats a hangover like a huge bowl of pho noodle soup -lrb- doused in chili paste and the rooster of course ! -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> although i 've never had the banh i have friends who have ordered it and loved it ! <sssss> the one other thing i suggest is to eat at the restaurant . <sssss> the food needs to be fresh and hot to really enjoy it . <sssss> hot or cold temps - nothing 's gon na come between me and my pho ! 
5		went here based on other reviews . <sssss> i had a check engine light on for my csf sensor . <sssss> they just fixed it like i asked and did n't try to upsell me on anything else . <sssss> the turnaround was fast and they were pretty nice guys all around . 
5		the best sandwich . <sssss> i 've tried all of the few options , but the mozza is the best . <sssss> do n't even worry about anything else . <sssss> fresh mozzarella made on the premises -- and some of the best damn bread . <sssss> absolutely fresh ingredients -- and many are locally grown ! <sssss> at $ 8 a sandwich , it 's a little expensive , but you can share ... and totally worth it . <sssss> best . <sssss> sandwich . <sssss> in phoenix . <sssss> go for take-away or just walk across the street to steele indian school park for an impromptu picnic . 
5		delicious juice . <sssss> lots of different types to try . <sssss> i stop by every time i 'm in the area . 
5		grilled cheese & tomato soup ... and i do n't even like tomatoes ! <sssss> delicious . 
5		really , really impressed with the vibe in this place . <sssss> filmbar is a nice mix of 60 's throwback and moroccan lounge . <sssss> sat at the bar and chatted with the bartenders and owner kelly . <sssss> having just spent the last year in nyc ... told him it felt like we never left . <sssss> there was a constant flow of people in just for drinks and to catch the next flick . <sssss> i ca n't wait to come down and catch a film . <sssss> great beer selection including lots of az beers . <sssss> love supporting local businesses . <sssss> bought a gift certificate for a friend 's birthday . 
5		we came here last thursday to celebrate my grandmother 's birthday and we were able to reserve the back room . <sssss> they were able to accommodate our extra guest and the wait staff was very friendly -lrb- and funny ! -rrb- <sssss> personally , i had the rainbow trout and potatoes with reisling and pinot grigio . <sssss> it 's a pricier place -lrb- not as pricy as vincent 's on camelback -rrb- , but well worth it ! <sssss> the food and wine were phenomenal and a good time was had by all ! 
5		the elements restaurant at sanctuary is truly a sanctuary place to be in , tucked away in a quiet resort with a great view of camelback mountain . <sssss> classy , elegant , and modern , it 's has a romantic atmosphere and great for a date . <sssss> they even had a live band the night we were there creating a cozy atmosphere . <sssss> the appetizer course that we shared was a duck and foie gras shumai . <sssss> talk about fusion food : chinese and french blend . <sssss> an odd combination , but surprisingly palatable . <sssss> the grilled foie gras on top tasted like a moist steak . <sssss> the duck confetti filling paired well with the strong flavor of the foie gras . <sssss> the teriyaki sauce added another asian touch . <sssss> on to the main course : plancha grilled halibut and a mustard crusted colorado rack of lamb . <sssss> the halibut was simply just ok , nothing too special . <sssss> the skin was crispy , but the fish was a bit dry . <sssss> i was wanting a citric taste from the lemon shellfish broth , but it did n't add too much flavor to the dish . <sssss> the medium rare rack of lamb store the show that night . <sssss> tender and juicy at the same time , i found my euphoria . <sssss> the taste was strong , but not overpowering that i can still taste the tender texture of the lamb . <sssss> definitely order medium rare to achieve this masterpiece in your mouth . <sssss> you wo n't regret it ! <sssss> as always , another chocolate dessert for this chocoholic . <sssss> the pb bomb : i just had to order because of the creative name . <sssss> wonderfully present , this dessert was basically a very rich and fancy reese 's peanut butter cup . <sssss> heaven in my mouth for sure . <sssss> another thing to look for at elements is the bar at happy hour . <sssss> it had a relaxing atmosphere , something you would n't see in the trendy scottsdale location . <sssss> the food selection is n't that wide or even that great , however the alcohol is high quality at a low price . <sssss> they had fresh ingredients and high-end liquor . <sssss> it was also fun sitting at the bar watching the bartender make my drink . <sssss> i still gave it a 5 stars even with the so-so fish , but everything else that i experienced made it wonderful in my book . <sssss> but i got ta hand it to elements for making the place so irresistible . <sssss> this is a place for foodies to come and retreat for a relaxing evening of good food and good music . 
5		wonderful coffee ! <sssss> oh my god , we both lived it . <sssss> took cuppacino and latte . <sssss> both were very tasty . <sssss> we had to ask for extra hot though . <sssss> we did n't have to ask for extra shot and neither needed sugar :-rrb- . <sssss> so yummy ! 
5		it 's hard to find a better , more efficient customer retail experience than in an apple store . <sssss> you might find an apple product a little cheaper online but it is so much easier in the store . <sssss> and it may sound silly but i love getting my receipt emailed to me . 
5		omg yummy ! <sssss> ok , i am a self proclaimed `` food whore '' i could sleep in a pan of veggie lasagne ! <sssss> not only is the food awesome but it is locally owned !!! <sssss> take that , salty olive garden and corporate america ! <sssss> i have been here many times but i have to say taking someone who has never been and seeing the look after their first bite ... priceless ! <sssss> i went with my `` friend with benefits '' and we had the best server ! <sssss> her name was misty and she was just the right amount of attentive , sweet and funny . <sssss> knowing they bring out a salad and bread with olive oil first , i asked if they could put the salami on the side since i am a veg . <sssss> guess what ? <sssss> it came out on the side ! <sssss> amazing ! <sssss> for our main courses , i had the eggplant and he had the stuffed shells . <sssss> we each tried a bite of each others meals and i liked the shells as much as the eggplant ! <sssss> i have had the manicotti there too and it was great . <sssss> so now i 'll be in a quandary the next time i go , what to order ? <sssss> if that was my only decision in life ! <sssss> this place gets really crowded on the weekends so go after 8 . <sssss> the house chianti is really good too ! 
5		this place is great ! <sssss> i wish i had found it before our last day and on the way to the airport . <sssss> this place has fresh fruits and nuts and breads . <sssss> there are a bunch of samples and quite a good selection of items . <sssss> the staff is also very nice . <sssss> we picked up a loaf of pumpkin bread as a thank you for our ride from the airport once we got home . <sssss> i think they liked it , i know we loved our samples . <sssss> if you are in the area , i definitely would go in to this place . <sssss> i think it is probably a bit more than the market , but the produce is very fresh . 
5		oh my , ohhhhh my , oh my !!!! <sssss> # 1 ham and cheese sandwich on texas toast . <sssss> and # 4 turkey tom i do n't know what it is about these sandwiches ... but they are delish ! <sssss> fresh , big , moist bread always fresh never dry or crumbly . <sssss> the meat tastes of a higher quality -lrb- not processed -rrb- yum yum yum !!!! 
5		a hay oasis ? <sssss> yes , and more . <sssss> if you have guinea pigs , you know that buying kaytee timothy hay in that little bag gets mighty expensive after a while . <sssss> you do n't always know what kind of quality it is or how old it is . <sssss> waiting at petco for a sale so you can save a buck off the hay just does n't do it for me any more ... okay , i 've got news for you -- no more petco for the damned hay . <sssss> come to aden 's hay oasis . <sssss> hay by the bale . <sssss> stop wasting your money . <sssss> when i was here , they were out of timothy hay bales , but bales of alfalfa and bermuda grass were like $ 15 or $ 16 per bale . <sssss> they did have large , gallon-sized ziplock bags filled with timothy hay for $ 2 . <sssss> two dollars ! <sssss> i got three , and they 're fresh and no doubt tasty to my cavies . <sssss> guinea pig owners in the middle of the valley may think that it 's too far of a drive out to higley just for hay , but consider what you pay every time you go to the pet store -- you get a tiny bag of hay that 's priced like it 's gold . <sssss> believe me , when you think about it , you realize that driving that distance to get a bale for $ 15 ai n't bad at all . <sssss> plus , they 're really friendly folks here . <sssss> to all my fellow cavy enthusiasts -- make the drive and get your hay here . <sssss> it 's full guinea pig bellies on the cheap . 
5		oh my hidden away friend dick 's ... you have halted my visitations to richardson 's and kept my mouth and gullet happy with your outstanding foodstuffs and tasty maragritas . <sssss> it 's hard to explain the menu . <sssss> a marriage of southern mexican , seafood , pizzas and quality . <sssss> the place is small , nay , cozy . <sssss> with great music always playing . <sssss> and if you need a private party , the back room is a great bet . <sssss> i 'd like to say i wish dick 's would stay hidden , because it is a gem , but it 's too great not to share . 
5		i heard very good things about this place from a few people . <sssss> after my horrific experience at another sewing machine place . <sssss> i was ready to give up , but decided to take it to one more place . <sssss> when i took my machine there i was already impressed by their computer system and the way they label each part to make sure it belongs to the right owner . <sssss> the other place i took my machine for 2 years , never had me in their system and never remembered the countless times i spent money in their store . <sssss> i was really surprised that in 2 days a service tech had looked at my machine for a diagnosis , the other store did n't even get to looking at my machine until 2 and half weeks later to tell me something was even wrong with my machine . <sssss> unfortunately , my sewing machine is a viking and it need some new parts that can only be sold and distributed by viking dealers . <sssss> but the service tech did tune up , adjust the tension , and let me know exactly what needed to be replaced in terms i can understand and not part numbers and techie vocabulary like the other store . <sssss> the tech even got it to sew better , although i am still waiting for things to get replaced , at least they were able to give back my machine after 3 days in a working condition that i can still sew light weighted gowns and use my industrial juki for the rest . <sssss> overall , their customer service is excellent and their staff knowledgeable and friendly . <sssss> i may be switching my brand loyalty from viking to bernina very soon . <sssss> that and when i worked at hancock fabrics when i was 16 , my boss ranted and raved about her bernina . 
5		the food is delicious enough to eat every last bite of the large portions . <sssss> ca n't get enough ! 
5		came here for the first time and loved it . <sssss> we were seated right away . <sssss> the waitress came over and took our order . <sssss> i ordered the betty boop , which is a fried chicken breast and one waffle . <sssss> my boss ordered a betty boop as well , and his wife ordered biscuits and gravy . <sssss> we were served our drinks in large mason jars . <sssss> i ordered pepsi , and my boss ordered ... wait for it ... red kool aid !!! <sssss> i thought that was awesome ! <sssss> so southern ! <sssss> the food came out about 10 minutes after ordering and it looked mouthwatering . <sssss> the chicken was fried just right , and the waffle was so good ! <sssss> next time i want to try the biscuits and gravy ... if i ever come back to phoenix in the near future . <sssss> we also had a side of green beans , and they were delicious . <sssss> they had a southern cajun kick to them , but it was so tasty . <sssss> not too spicy . <sssss> prices are good , not too expensive and the food portions are fulfilling ! <sssss> i left here satisfied ! 
5		great employees ! <sssss> watched a cute , tall cashier take the time to speak with an about guns while still checking out 2 lines of people ... wish i would 've noticed his name . <sssss> it was really sweet and i 'm sure it made his day ! 
5		i drive thru this location at least 3 times a week and i 've never had a bad experience . <sssss> they are always friendly and the service is consistently great . 
5		last week i came home from work to a dead ac during a typical phoenix august but i was lucky enough to find this wonderful company on yelp . <sssss> i have never seen so many perfect reviews but now that i have experienced the company myself , i can see why . <sssss> miguel and his son are so nice , fair and professional . <sssss> i know absolutely nothing about ac units or most things that require `` handy-work '' so i was weary to hire a company that i had never used before , my fears were unfounded . <sssss> they were prompt , fast with their work and very fair with the price . <sssss> miguel was also very friendly and easy to talk to . <sssss> if you need any work on your ac or heater , miguel is your guy ! 
5		have been back for the water boiled fish and another time had it delivered to my home . <sssss> i stll have to rave about it ! <sssss> it is now one of my favorite food cravings ! 
5		wow . <sssss> the food is beyond perfection . <sssss> they really seem to understand how to begin with the best ingredients and to properly match all parts of a meal to create a masterpiece . <sssss> i love the salmon super food entree , but the menu does seem to change so be ready to be impressed by new , delicious and healthy discoveries . 
5		grew up coming here and i love every time coming here . <sssss> someone complained that it was n't that good because their meal which consisted of a side salad was not that `` great . '' <sssss> are you kidding me ? <sssss> who the heck grades a mexican food place based on a side salad ? <sssss> whatever . <sssss> my enchiladas were great , the sauce was excellent and my rice and beans were of excellent moist and flavorful quality . <sssss> i have always found the rice at filiberto 's to be dry but the rice here is very moist due to their being more tomato sauce in it and a compound called salt . <sssss> try the bakery , there are many excellent pastries to try and the salsa bar has more variety than you can find at the more common walk up mexican eateries . <sssss> as for all the comments on the parking lot being shady , honestly in the evening many families come in here to grab something to take home or to have a family meal . <sssss> seriously people , the parking lot was clean and well-lit , everything looked freshly painted and clear of trash . <sssss> come down off of your high horse and enjoy some good food . 
5		oh man let me tell you about this place . <sssss> i have been here a few times before and they recently started opening for lunch , which might i add was the greatest thing ever . <sssss> we went on a friday . <sssss> they open at 11:00 and we were seated right away . <sssss> within 30 minutes this restaruant was full and there was a wait . <sssss> granted there are only about 8-10 -lrb- 2 -rrb- seater tables and 6-7 -lrb- 4 -rrb- seated tables and maybe 8-10 seats at the bar . <sssss> still 30 minutes . <sssss> i do have to say that they have a wine and appitizer bar/house next door for you to sit and mingle while waiting for a seat to open for you . <sssss> i got the margherita pizza minus the basil add prosciutto . <sssss> man this is the best pizza i have ever had . <sssss> the sause is super simple which is awesome . <sssss> they cook it in the brick oven pizza stove and when it comes out they put the prosciutto on it . <sssss> my partmer got the wise guy pizza and added muswhroom . <sssss> same thing she always gets , that should tell you how good it is . <sssss> she also for the daily salad , which was fennel , parsley , watermelon in a light lemony juicy . <sssss> she said it taste like summer . <sssss> i am a pizza fan , like one of those ones that can buy a frozen one from the store and be just as happy with it . <sssss> so for me to say this is the best , listen people . <sssss> side note : they do not accept reservations and if you get there in the evening on a weekend you are going to be looking at a 2 hour wait . <sssss> trust me though it will be worth it 
5		ate at tryst cafe on a saturday night of a weekend getaway to jw marriott desert ridge with my husband and children aged 11 and 15 . <sssss> we had done a lot of driving that day up to jerome and sedona and back down through the dark of night and a thunder storm . <sssss> we were so happy to find the highly rated tryst cafe still open at 9:30 pm . <sssss> adrianna and haley gladly welcomed us into the restaurant and helped us with our appetizer and entree selections . <sssss> we had the tilapia crisps and fried green beans to start . <sssss> tilapia crisps were ok , fried green beans were spectacular !!!! <sssss> immediately got another order of the green beans which we had to fight our children off to get a bite of !!! <sssss> yes , a teenager who hates green beans could not stop eating these ! <sssss> i highly recommend them . <sssss> hubby got the ahi salad - amazing with fresh greens and a spicy wasabi dressing . <sssss> i got the southwest salad and asked for steak instead of the chicken it comes with -lrb- no problem - said adrianna -rrb- . <sssss> my salad was fresh , crisp and lovely but i probably should have left it with the chicken . <sssss> steak was n't great . <sssss> our girls both got the pasta of the day which was penne with pesto , chicken and sautéed yellow squash-delicious ! <sssss> kids devoured it . <sssss> adrianna and haley were so welcoming and accommodating . <sssss> we had a great experience here and will definitely go back next time we are in phoenix . 
5		stopped in for a sandwich today and ordered the blt and added avocado . <sssss> first thing i noticed was the guy grabbed a fresh avocado ... yes a real avocado , not a pre packaged container of guac . <sssss> he made a little guac mixture right in front of me just by mashing the avocado and adding a little salt and pepper i think . <sssss> after he made that he started on the sandwich and he started piling on the bacon ... and seemed like he did n't stop ! <sssss> it was a good amount of bacon and it was yummy crispy bacon too . <sssss> obviously it had been pre-cooked but it was n't microwave bacon , it was actual real bacon . <sssss> nice change from most sandwich shops that use microwave bacon . <sssss> sandwich was made pretty quickly too . <sssss> i got the impression the guy making my sandwich is the owner and he had two sons working with him . <sssss> everyone was very pleasant and the boy working the register was polite and said please and thank you . <sssss> i know it sounds silly but i was impressed by his manners , especially at his age . <sssss> i got home and ate my sandwich and i was sooooo happy ! <sssss> the bread is fresh and almost spongy like , which is good . <sssss> the sandwich just melted together perfectly . <sssss> i liked it so much i will probably be back for dinner tonight . <sssss> good job ! <sssss> i hope this place stays ! 
5		i discovered lush while puttering around in a tiny town in western england called cheltenham while on a business trip with my husband . <sssss> i walked by the shop and the smell hit me and drew me right in . <sssss> i have been hooked ever since , and had been visiting the one in scottsdale most recently , so imagine my excitement when i discovered that they opened one here in chandler . <sssss> i have loved every product i have bought , and the service is amazing - you can try almost everything and they love to use the products on you - for example , they are giving your feet the treatment with their new foot scrub right now . <sssss> on top of how great the products are , they are great for you and the earth . <sssss> everything is handmade and natural , and most products are vegan too . <sssss> they also support environmental and charitable causes and if you bring back 5 of their black pots , you get a fresh face mask free . <sssss> these masks are like nothing you can find anywhere - so fresh you have to keep them in the fridge ! <sssss> so , even though you can find cheaper skin , body and hair care elsewhere , it 's worth every penny . <sssss> if you try nothing else , try the dream cream - it is absolutely the most amazing skin cream i have ever tried and smells yummy . 
5		best barbeque in the west valley . <sssss> for take out or dine in it ca n't be beat . <sssss> i just ordered 10 lbs for an outdoor party . <sssss> i called 30 minutes ahead and they had my order ready and waiting when i arrived . <sssss> being from the south i know good bbq and this is the closest i had since moving to az. . <sssss> it 's much better than old el paso bbq . <sssss> they also have really good shrimp ! 
5		so far - this is the best coffee place in town . <sssss> i love how relaxed but clean and modern this place feels . <sssss> i especially enjoy the days when they open their large glass doors in the front - so we can sit and enjoy our oh so smooth honey vanilla latte and mocha and enjoy some great conversation . <sssss> the honey vanilla latte - smooth slightly sweet and delicious . <sssss> my bf gets the mocha - initially he got one on accident after ordering a hot chocolate - but this accident was a good thing . <sssss> he gets it now everytime . <sssss> we have decied to make this a regular stop during the weekends - he gets a burrito -lrb- which is constantly changing -rrb- and i pick one of their yummy pastries -lrb- bagel with fresh vegi cream cheese - oh so tasty -rrb- or the home made granola . <sssss> just delicious . <sssss> i also enjoy the connection to bunky - which i can wonder through after enjoying my weekend breakfast . <sssss> well done ! <sssss> well done in deed !!!! 
5		my grandparents went here , my parents go here , and now i go here . <sssss> that should say something in and of itself . <sssss> the staff here that i 've dealt with have always been pleasant . <sssss> plus , he 's got an in-house lab for all your blood draws and ua 's and such . <sssss> dr drury himself is always pleasant . <sssss> he takes his time with patients , answering all your questions and never making you feel rushed . <sssss> because he does this with all his patients , sometimes you have to sit in the waiting room a little longer . <sssss> overall , top notch . 
5		always fun , always good music . <sssss> even food @ lunch is pretty good . <sssss> -lrb- burger special -rrb- . 
5		love this place ! <sssss> great rooms , great bar/restaurant , access to golds gym , free coffee in the morning , happy hour in the evening , good service and awesome location within walking distance to tons of stuff . <sssss> i always stay here when i am in phoenix . 
5		i just experienced the best service ever from dulia -lrb- i believe was her name -rrb- at la bocca tonight ! <sssss> i knew it was going to be a good night when she warned my friend that the lemoncillo was made with everclear and very strong . <sssss> rather than bringing the drink , she suggested that my friend try the lemoncillo before ordering and brought a small glass of lemoncillo and orangecillo . <sssss> she was right - both of the `` cillo 's '' were very strong . <sssss> i decided on a glass of red sangria and my friend a mojito . <sssss> both were delicious ! <sssss> as for food , i ordered the bruschetta and was impressed . <sssss> out of the 4 types of bruschetta i ordered , i recommend the proschutto bruschetta . <sssss> i 'm a huge fan of salmon so i ordered the smoked salmon one as well , but was slightly disappointed . <sssss> both of my friends ordered pizzas -lrb- because on tuesdays they have a 2 for 1 pizza special -rrb- and both of them seemed to enjoy their meals as much as , if not more than i. i anticipate going back soon , especially after seeing two girls next to me get the cookie dessert ! <sssss> overall , highly recommended ! 
5		first off , let me apologize to d'licious dishes . <sssss> i have lived right down the street from you , driven past you , checked you out , heard good things , but never pulled the trigger . <sssss> my loss . <sssss> i decided to check you out yesterday and was surprised at your vast array of yumminess . <sssss> how could i not realize you were my soulmate when you have three of my favorite qualities : wine , meat and sandwiches ? <sssss> on our first date yesterday , you treated me to a great bottle of washingon state merlot and two small pies . <sssss> i was thinking about you all night after that one . <sssss> round two was today . <sssss> you filled me with your amazing daily special of a cuban sandwich and a side of your orzo salad with feta . <sssss> i must say that you gave me the best cuban sandwich i 've ever had ! <sssss> that puppy was done right with the pork slow roasted in sofrito , and then shredded . <sssss> i 've actually never had pork in a sandwich that good , like , ever ! <sssss> the bread was perfectly crusty , cheese just right and perfect amount of pickles . <sssss> seriously ? <sssss> where have you been all my life ? <sssss> d'licious dishes , or dd , i think i love you . <sssss> youi 'll be seeing more of me in the near future ... pssssst just do n't tell my wife 
5		this wonderful woman is so good at keeping my wardrobe up to date ! <sssss> if you are trying to get the most of your fashion budget , why not update what you have ? <sssss> i have been using her for years . <sssss> she is fast and very good . <sssss> she can shorten hems to update a dress or skirt . <sssss> or maybe you need her to make your skinny jeans skinnier , she can do it . <sssss> you can even take her things that you bought on sale that maybe were not just the right fit . <sssss> elizebeth is your gal . <sssss> she is also great at repairs . <sssss> definitely a thrifty find for all you budget minded fashionistas out there . <sssss> now clean out your closet ! 
5		this is the bbq that anyone from the lone star state will know and be thankful for . <sssss> having moved here roughly 8 years ago from texas , my wife and i have been at a loss for `` real '' bbq until rudy 's opened up last week . <sssss> it 's just as one should expect ; brisket is lean and flavorful enough to stand on it 's own without the use of sauce . <sssss> thankfully , rudy 's `` sause '' is just an added bonus . <sssss> be sure to choose carefully as rudy 's offers both moist and lean brisket . <sssss> the moist will be a bit fattier but no less wonderful . <sssss> service was excellent and prompt for a wait that went out the door . <sssss> the fact that there was a group from houston to our left and austin to our right at the counter only confirmed what real bbq lovers already know about this wonderful establishment . <sssss> menu is the same as texas locations : pork sausage , turkey , brisket , ribs , etc , and white bread with your meal . <sssss> now please move into gilbert . 
5		i am obsessed with this theater , as it is an escape from reality to curl up in reclined leather bound seats , comfort food , and drinks all while watching a new movie on the big screen . <sssss> additionally , as a brand new staff has been well trained and just as excited about the theater itself , the customer service is very welcoming and kind . <sssss> if you 're not on a tight budget , and love movies , drinks , and food as much as i do , this is the place for you !! <sssss> : -rrb- 
5		had lunch here today with fellow yelpers robyn n. and rand h. well to start the place was built in an old claim jumper location and all the booths and decor were used again , it is very nice and comfy . <sssss> the food was really good they offer a couple of unusual dishes not seen at other chinese buffets and a good dessert selection . <sssss> the food here is displayed nicer then any other asian buffet i have been at . <sssss> but i still like a couple of the big super buffets better.this place is probably in the top 5 asian buffets . 
5		joe knows bbq . 
5		total wine is bloody fantastic . <sssss> costco prices , every bottle size you can imagine -lrb- yes , even those freaky tiny airplane bottles -rrb- , wine , mixers , beer ... you name it , it 's here . <sssss> sorry bevmo , i have a new boyfriend and his name is total wine . 
5		somehow , i ended up in this stretch of phoenix as i was searching for another place that i never found . <sssss> it turned out to be a great mistake because i ended up finding a really great breakfast burrito . <sssss> it was $ 6.99 , but the best part of this item was the six choices of ingredients that you get and that does n't include the three eggs and home fries that are automatically included . <sssss> there were at least 6 meat choices and ten veggies , etc that could be selected . <sssss> i went with ground beef , onions -lrb- green and white -rrb- and peppers and monterey jack and sour cream on the side . <sssss> red salsa is automatically included . <sssss> the eggs and beef were well cooked and the burrito was rolled very tightly . <sssss> clearly , a top 5 breakfast burrito . <sssss> all items are available to go , but you can eat outside also . 
5		i 'll tell you a few things about the dude at bowers that have put him at the top of my go-to list for auto repair . <sssss> he has demonstrated a keen sense of what is going on with my car and is not reluctant to tell me what it is . <sssss> on more than one occasion i have come in with my 1998 ford contour and explained some problem or issue that the car is having , and he has listened , calmly made suggestions about what it might be , never once tried to persuade me to leave the car or pay him money to look at it or fix something i was n't asking about -lrb- god knows he could have - the car is 15 yrs old -rrb- , and even diagnosed the problem and told me exactly how to fix it myself at a fraction of what he would have to charge . <sssss> he pressure-tested my car for free to isolate a coolant leak -lrb- to the water pump -rrb- for me . <sssss> six months later , after i realized i did n't have the capabilities of fixing it in my garage , but having already bought a water pump and coolant , he fixed it for me and subtracted the cost of the part and the fluid , allowing me to use the stuff i bought . <sssss> it 's difficult to tell with auto repair guys , but i get a good vibe with this guy cuz he does n't seem to have an angle . <sssss> well , except that he seems to be thinking more long-range in his business approach - he is n't gon na try to squeeze you for everything he can get just to make a sale . <sssss> he 'd rather make a customer . <sssss> by shooting straight and trusting you to figure out for yourself if and how he can help you , so you can make the decisions that are right for you and not feel pressured to make the wrong ones . <sssss> bowers gets my business first for these reasons , and is the first place i recommend to friends . 
5		oh noca , my once and always love ! <sssss> eliot wexler should take another bow for bringing matt taylor into his cavern of culinary yum . <sssss> after my fried chicken sunday super , i was left just as delighted as ever anxious to try mr. taylor 's full menu . <sssss> just as it has been since day one , the atmosphere was warm but fabulous , the service was excellent , and mr. wexler was a perfect host . <sssss> after a yummy amuse , we shared spot on gazpacho and a blue cheese garden salad . <sssss> then , we sampled the fried chicken and potatoes and the vegetable `` pot pie '' . <sssss> juicy and creative all . <sssss> but then ... you sweet genius ... you earned your own spot in my heart with the brandied bread pudding . <sssss> are you kidding me ? <sssss> honestly , i would butcher it in a description ... it must be experienced . <sssss> the best take on this favorite i have ever had . <sssss> thank you , mr. taylor ! <sssss> noca is always a special night . <sssss> thank you for this one and i ca n't wait for the next . 
5		i have been going to this place for years . <sssss> i just love , love this place . <sssss> if you like hot spicy food , then look no further . <sssss> they are kid friendly . <sssss> they know us by our names . <sssss> it 's one of my favortie place to eat . <sssss> my favorite dish is the panang chicken . <sssss> you wo n't be disappointed . 
5		i 'm usually not a fan of places with `` express '' in the title . <sssss> bad memories of styofoam and rivers of grease , y' know ? <sssss> this has been absolutely delicious every time i 've been there for lunch . <sssss> i 've brought coworkers and they become quickly addicted as well , salivating at the idea of a gyro with fries . <sssss> i wish getting a salad for fries was n't a dollar more -lrb- for a healthy lunch alternative -rrb- , but i 'll live . <sssss> oh , and the hummus is great , too . 
5		definitely a place you got ta check out on a hot day . <sssss> actually , i 'd probably go here on a cold day too . <sssss> it 's self serve so you can get any amount you want . <sssss> i tried the vanilla , peanut butter and oatmeal cookie . <sssss> i should have just gotten the oatmeal cookie . <sssss> while the other stuff is good , the oatmeal cookie is amazing . <sssss> you have to try it out . <sssss> it has oatmeal in and just the right amount of cinnamon and sugar . <sssss> really , you got ta try it . <sssss> they have an awesome selection of toppings to put on . <sssss> they say they have 60 , but the guy behind the counter said he has more in back . <sssss> there was so many , i was too confused what i wanted because i wanted the all . <sssss> the workers are super friendly and will help you out with suggestions . <sssss> this place is definitely worth visiting . <sssss> go . <sssss> now ! 
5		i had this very bad craving for a torta today and i found this was the closest place to my office and it looked like it had very good reviews so i decided to give it a try . <sssss> i 'm really glad i did , because this was the best torta i had since i moved to the states . <sssss> i had the al pastor which was moist and properly seasoned and the horchata water was n't overweeningly sweet like other places . <sssss> grandma cooking in the back is always a good sign of great food to come . <sssss> a little bit expensive for a torta -lrb- i mean , in mexico you get really god ones for 2-3 bucks -rrb- but i 'll be definitely be back . 
5		this location has been recently remodeled , i think it could still use some more work as their mesa location is so much nicer but the food makes up for it . <sssss> the only downside , is the pasty take a little while to bake , but just sit back , relax , and sip down on a beer or any other drink from their bar , a local gem . 
5		the cheese lady behind the cheese counter told me that she 'd order me any sort of exotic cheese i 'd like ! <sssss> freakin ' awesome ! <sssss> but shhhh , do n't tell the fda . 
5		hosted a wonderful birthday dinner for my wife at arrivederci . <sssss> the service , the food and the wine were outstanding . <sssss> the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating . <sssss> the food was hot , flavorful and just like the italian we love . <sssss> thanks for a memorable evening . 
5		great interactive museum ! <sssss> we have visited twice since moving from tx . <sssss> loved the dinosaurs . 
5		i dig michael 's . <sssss> i go here for my scrapbooking supplies , and other crafty stuff that i may need . <sssss> they carry loads of stuff-floral , art supplies , candles and do framing as well . <sssss> the store is well organized , well lit , and they are open late ! <sssss> plus , they also send out weekly coupons for 20-50 percent off , so make sure you use it ! <sssss> this place is right off the loop 101 , and kind of hidden . <sssss> its right near a pier one , so make sure you keep an eye peeled for it ... easy to miss , especially if its your first time there ! 
5		i ca n't believe i 've never heard of this place after living here for 20 years !!! <sssss> outstanding burger !!!! <sssss> had the bacon , cheese and avocado burger and it instantly goes into my top 5 of all time best burgers !!! 
5		dr. garick ho 's practice is located right next to pho chandler , in the home depot plaza . <sssss> i hesitated before making an appointment at all brite dental because it had no reviews/ratings on the web . <sssss> but , since i like to give business to fellow asians and all brite is in my vicinity , i decided to take a risk . <sssss> the result is that i 'm a very satisfied customer . <sssss> dr. garick ho and his assistant shelly performed a thorough cleaning . <sssss> they were honest and sincere when making various recommendations . <sssss> i 'll be returning this dentist in six months . 
5		i have been going to teresa for massage for over almost two years and every time i notice such a wonderful , profound effect on my health . <sssss> i often have back issues since i sit at a computer for many hours at a time , and each time i visit teresa my back feels so much better ! <sssss> she uses many techniques including hot stones and essential oils , which leave me feeling relaxed and rejuvenated . <sssss> i have also attended two of her yoga classes and had a great experience . <sssss> the class is a good pace and is a great workout . 
5		do not judge a book by it 's cover ! <sssss> so a friend invited me to karaoke here . <sssss> i had never heard of it before , but when she gave me the address my first thought was `` screw that ! <sssss> i 'm not going to a bar in that area ! '' <sssss> but i forced myself to go anyway . <sssss> it had been a long week and i needed a drink . <sssss> so i find this place and again thought `` screw this , i 'm outta here ! '' <sssss> its right behind the -lrb- sl -rrb- ez-in motel and in a very industrial kinda scary part of town that i drive through every day to and from work . <sssss> i had actually seen the bar hundreds of times before and was never compelled to stop in . <sssss> that said , i am so glad i forced myself to go . <sssss> the area of town it 's in is n't the best and looks rather shady . <sssss> this is proof as to just how looks really are deceiving ! <sssss> the area was quiet and safe . <sssss> the inside of the bar was spotless . <sssss> it was clean , warm and inviting . <sssss> i met renee and one of her staff -lrb- or business partner maybe , not sure -rrb- desiree -lrb- please tell me i got her name right ! -rrb- <sssss> they both are so friendly and welcoming . <sssss> they shook my hand , remembered my name , made small talk with me . <sssss> it was great ! <sssss> i definitely felt like i belonged . <sssss> the people singing karaoke were really good too . <sssss> i was expecting something reminiscent of cameron diaz in my best friend 's wedding but i was wrong . <sssss> listening to them , you almost forgot you were listening to an amateur performing at a karaoke night . <sssss> they were a pleasure to listen to ! <sssss> and the man performing mc hammer 's ca n't touch this was hilarious !!! <sssss> the dj was great too . <sssss> apparently it was his first time and i never would have known . <sssss> he seemed very comfortable and had a great personality . <sssss> i would have stayed longer , but i was hungry and needed to eat before i was n't able to drive myself home . <sssss> definitely planning a trip back ! 
5		i 've taken 3 cars to chuck at tobias and each time , he 's exceeded expectations . <sssss> customer service is fantastic . <sssss> on a mercedes convertible repair , his quote was less than half of what shumacher wanted for a very intricate hydraulic repair . <sssss> on an older acura , he continued to work on the vehicle until the air conditioning was blowing colder than it did originally . <sssss> i 'm now a loyal customer and call chuck before anyone else . 
5		my nephew recently passed away . <sssss> he had only been in phoenix for a short time and his mother and i had to get him prepared and transported back to his hometown of biloxi , ms. i had no idea of even where to start so i went on yelp and found best funeral services . <sssss> dr. ken stanton guided and assisted my sister and i thru every step of the way and it was truly a blessing . <sssss> in our moment of loss and grief he and the staff help us deal with a very difficult and seemingly insurmountable task . <sssss> they are truly incredible and my entire family thanks them from the bottom of our hearts . 
5		great place to have a birthday party , or any celebration . <sssss> i was working with jillian -lrb- who is awesome -rrb- . <sssss> stand up live had everything reserved for us and set up . <sssss> it was a package deal , that everyone was happy with . <sssss> the service is a bit slow , so i suggest you order 2 drinks @ once . <sssss> a great atmosphere , copper blues is great . <sssss> . <sssss> yes the show may go over so you might have to pay for an hour of parking , yes you have to purchase 2 drinks in the stand up live section -lrb- not including copper blues -rrb- if you want to go out and have a good time , you might have to spend some money . <sssss> . <sssss> its worth it ! <sssss> cant wait to plan my next party at stand up live ! 
5		double ham , egg , and cream cheese on an everything bagel ; you wo n't be disappointed ! 
5		i love this museum , you see the instruments and you also get the opportunity to listen to what they actually sound like which is really cool also it shows each country and what they have brought to the table as far as music goes interesting indeed . <sssss> the place itself is beautiful my friends and i really enjoyed it . <sssss> i recommend everyone checks it out 
5		golf , rooms , blah blah - it 's all about brunch . <sssss> you 'll have to hear about all that other stuff in someone else 's review . <sssss> love their brunch ! <sssss> we have been going to their brunches for years . <sssss> groups from 4 to 12 of us have made the trip and it 's always a favorite . <sssss> last year my friend told me that when she called she was told they had stopped going brunches , but i actually overheard someone talking about going there for easter . <sssss> lo and behold they are back on ! <sssss> i talked with a girl there and she said it must have been a miscommunication as they always shut down during the off season -lrb- summer -rrb- and the length of time each year may be a bit different , but they are totally open for business right now . <sssss> brunch is $ 32 , or $ 34 if you include champagne , and really , why would n't you ? <sssss> service has never been anything but positively outstanding . <sssss> but the food is what really puts it over the top . <sssss> so much food and so many great options . <sssss> more than you 'll get at the compass room , and at least as much as you 'll get at wrigley mansion - but for half the price . <sssss> and because it 's part of a resort , you can either chose to dress up , or go resort casual and you 'll fit in with their other guests who may be catching a round of golf right after they eat . <sssss> you can see a sample sunday brunch menu at http://www.orangetreegolfresort.com/pdfs/sunday%20brunch.pdf . <sssss> they also do special brunches for easter and mother 's day . <sssss> be sure to call ahead to get reservations . <sssss> this is a popular spot with the locals as well as the guests and space may not always be available at the last minute . 
5		qt ! <sssss> woot woot ! <sssss> best convient store ever created . <sssss> period . 
5		if you are into gardening or would like to purchase plants that do not die in a few days , buy them from lowe 's . <sssss> i loved the selection in plants they had . <sssss> the people who work in the garden center were available to answer questions and they had a huge selection of flowers and also vegetables including bulbing onions etc. . 
5		love the irish nachos !! <sssss> and the service is always great !! 
5		i went here last sunday for brunch after discovering them on the whistl app for iphone . <sssss> this is by far one of the best deals in the valley . <sssss> for $ 10 , you get a 10 oz arizona beer -lrb- or monster mimosa -rrb- , along with one of their 10 entrees . <sssss> between three people , to only spend $ 30 , enjoy a beer , and be truly stuffed is a feat for any restaurant in this town . <sssss> we ordered the biscuits & beer gravy , the breakfast flatbread , and the green chile pork carnitas . <sssss> i had the orange blossom beer by papago brewing company , while my two friends each got the hefeweizen by four peaks . <sssss> the biscuits and gravy is probably one of my favorite dishes on earth . <sssss> the bisuits are smothered in the the thick gravy , with massive chunks of sausage . <sssss> to top it off , they put a couple pieces of bacon on top . <sssss> the flavor was very savory , not too salty or overpowering in any sense . <sssss> the breakfast flatbread was very unique , turning a pizza into a breakfast it came with scrambled eggs , spanish chorizo , potato hash , caponata , and arugula . <sssss> the sweetness of the caponata blended perfectly with the chorizo . <sssss> the potatoes also helped balance the flavors quite nicely . <sssss> the green chile pork carnitas were also very good , but nothing groundbreaking . <sssss> it was probably the most traditional menu item . <sssss> it came with the carnitas , flour tortillas , and scrambled eggs . <sssss> it was fun though putting together my own little wrap with all of the ingredients . <sssss> as for the beer , i was very impressed with the orange blossom . <sssss> it was extremely refreshing , and the citrus flavor was not too overpowering . <sssss> there was some subtle nodes of vanilla , which i though was unusual for beer , but really carried the flavor of the drink . <sssss> my friends both said they enjoyed the hefeweizen . <sssss> we 've always been a big fan of four peaks ' beers . <sssss> we saw some other people drinking the monster mimosas , and they are huge ! <sssss> i would love to try one , but the acidity of orange juice does not sit well with me anymore , but i can imagine that they are excellent . <sssss> as for the service and atmosphere , i would still give it a perfect 5 stars . <sssss> the staff was very friendly and very knowledgeable about their food and drink list . <sssss> the layout of the restaurant is very unique . <sssss> it has the old style german bier-haus vibe , with a modern american twist . <sssss> each dining area has its own style . <sssss> i would definitely recommend this place for their brunch . <sssss> they also do bbqs on the weekends in the evening too . <sssss> if youre a foodie like me and want to find other great deals like ohso , definitely check out the whistl app on the app store . <sssss> it 's free to use , and i 've already found several new places in the valley that really rock ! 
5		we love this hotel and stay here whenever we visit friends in az. . <sssss> we always get a good rate : this last time we also got $ 50/day food credit . <sssss> perfect ! <sssss> the rooms are spacious and comfortable for our family of four - thank goodness . <sssss> also , no noise from surrounding rooms and fairly easy to keep a good temperature . <sssss> the main attraction at this hotel is the kid-sized water park and mini 18-hole golf course . <sssss> the kids could play here for days . <sssss> also , the pools in the hotel courtyards are nice too . <sssss> the hottub is always nice and hot , the way i like them . 
5		my wife and i recently rescued a 4 year old husky/lab mix -lrb- leo -rrb- and we needed an experienced dog trainer to work with right away . <sssss> two colleagues of mine recommended jimi livshitz as the best dog trainer in phoenix , hands down . <sssss> after speaking with jimi on the phone and then viewing his website -lrb- which has a lot of great info and videos -rrb- we were so excited to have found him ! <sssss> jimi was extremely knowledgeable and provided us with more information in our first session with leo than all the tips we had read or received from friends combined . <sssss> from the beginning we could tell jimi knew what he was doing and that he 's been doing this for a very long time . <sssss> most importantly , he made training a fun experience ! <sssss> within the first 15 minutes he had leo following several basic commands and walking around on leash without pulling . <sssss> he helped us understand the mistakes we were subconsciously making and how leo would interpret them . <sssss> much of the session involved having my wife and i take control of the leash and going through the proper motions and reactions which really helped build our confidence to keep up with training at home . <sssss> jimi 's philosophy is about building a strong bond between dogs and their owners and this really showed through his training techniques . <sssss> leo has come so far in just a few short weeks thanks to jimi and we really look forward to continuing to work with him . <sssss> thanks jimi ! 
5		when i first moved to phoenix in 2006 i was so moved by the exemplary service and high quality of mcdonald 's food at this location that i wrote an email letting them know how i feel . <sssss> i felt this was the best served , freshest tasting mcdonald 's food i had experienced and the staff was always great and professional . <sssss> because of my praising email , they mailed me two free extra value meal coupons . <sssss> very nice . <sssss> all mcdonald 's should be like this one . <sssss> i recognize it is weird reviewing chains -lrb- especially a mcdonald 's -rrb- , but this one i feel deserved it . <sssss> still do n't like it ? <sssss> tough . 
5		i would have written a 5-star review about spinato 's anyway , but after an experience this weekend , i had to yelp about it asap ... i drove from mesa just to pick up pizza for my family -lrb- yes , it 's that good -rrb- , and when i was getting in my car to leave , i was holding the pizza and the box caught the corner of my rear-view mirror . <sssss> the entire large pizza spilled in the front seat of my car , all over the console , gear shift , seat , floor , etc. . <sssss> it was a mess ! <sssss> i tried to clean it up , but i really needed soap and water , so i went in to ask for some napkins . <sssss> the manager , tim , overheard me ask and asked what happened . <sssss> when i explained , he immediately got me wet towels to clean up the mess and made me a new pizza , free of additional charge ! <sssss> he obviously did n't have to do that , as it was not spinato 's fault in any way . <sssss> plus , the place was packed -lrb- as usual -rrb- , but he bumped my pizza to the front of the line . <sssss> if i was n't convinced before that spinato 's is the best -- not just for food taste but for customer service -- i would be sure of it now ! <sssss> things to get : the sicilian pizza . <sssss> it 's thick and awesome . <sssss> order jalapenos on top . <sssss> they are a nice balance to the sweet sauce . <sssss> also , get the starter salad and the raspberry vinaigrette dressing -- it 's tart and perfect . <sssss> something unique : the spaghetti-filled calzone . <sssss> yep , you heard me -- carbs baked inside of carbs ! <sssss> :-rrb- the servers are great , the management is great , the location is great -lrb- easy parking and plenty of it , including street parking -rrb- , and the food is so wonderful ! <sssss> try one of their multiple locations throughout the valley -- you wo n't be disappointed . <sssss> tip : they do n't take lunch reservations , but if you get there earlier than your appointed time , they have no problem pulling together multiple tables for larger groups . 
5		the grill is the restaurant attached to the tpc stadium golf course and is run by the fairmont princess hotel . <sssss> it was formerly a steak house , but it 's theme was changed to chop and fish house to avoid direct competition with the other property restaurant , `` bourbon steak '' , a michael mina signature faux chic-dive that can barely get food out of the kitchen . <sssss> the princess closed the other property restaurants , marquesa -lrb- 5 stars -rrb- and la hacienda -lrb- 5 stars -rrb- to drive business to bourbon steak . <sssss> the grill easily and seemingly without effort beats the bourbon steak restaurant hands down in every category . <sssss> during the day , for lunch , the views of the golf course -lrb- # 18 -rrb- are restful and pleasing . <sssss> the golfers add a pleasant touch to the view . <sssss> at night , the view is inky blackness , which is ok by me . <sssss> i never understand how this place survives . <sssss> in spite of the princess hotel total lack of interest in the success of this restaurant , the grill continues to be a great place to get an if somewhat expensive , excellent dinner . <sssss> in fairness , in terms of cost , it 's no worse than mastros , ocean or any other high end restaurant , and certainly less expensive than bourbon steak , but the setting is much more intimate , the service much better , and the food every bit as good , if not better than those other `` must do '' places . <sssss> the staff is always knowledgeable , friendly and attentive . <sssss> i 've been many times and have never been disappointed . <sssss> the service is , in a word , professional . <sssss> our recent dinner of vermouth mussels , appetizer ravioli , fillet mignon , pan seared mushrooms and risotto was up to their usual standards . <sssss> the ravioli in particular was incredible , sparking a small battle for a access to the delicious pasta . <sssss> although we did n't have fish , the fish menu is pretty extensive and always done well . <sssss> the table next to us ordered the lamb and i could overhear them raving about how good it was . <sssss> i had the lamb last time and was pleased . <sssss> we were similarly happy with our choices on this occasion . <sssss> there is an extensive wine list and a good selection of by-the-glass choices . <sssss> bottom line : if you are looking for white linen tablecloth experience , the grill is the place to go . <sssss> good food , professional service , you will be able hear your dinner companions and you will be well taken care of . <sssss> update : the grill is only open for breakfast and lunch during the summer -lrb- june - august -rrb- months . <sssss> sill a great place to go for lunch until it re-opens for dinner . 
5		one of the best places to go in scottsdale . <sssss> absolutely perfect . <sssss> service , food , drinks ... everything . <sssss> do n't miss this one . <sssss> price is probably on the upper end but not bad . <sssss> i recommend this place to everyone . 
5		my sister came into town yesterday and i have been telling her i have been craving dim sum . <sssss> so when she landed at sky harbor , we went straight to china king . <sssss> there were only a few people that were in there but we still made it for the dim sum . <sssss> to my understanding it is typically packed over the weekend and i will try it over a weekend because i think they may offer more of a variety . <sssss> my sister and i got 5 different types of dim sum and a pot of tea which set us back 13 bucks . <sssss> which is not bad at all . <sssss> we also had some left overs but if i brought home chicken feet , i think my husband would freak out . <sssss> the only bad thing that i would have to say is getting someones attention for the pot of tea . <sssss> just to reiterate from other peoples review , drink tea while you are eating dim sum . <sssss> it helps with digestion and you do n't feel heavy after leaving the place . <sssss> do n't add any sugar and let the tea sit there for about 4 mins so the leaves have a chance to bloom , you will be able to taste the tea alot better . <sssss> overall , the food was good and i plan on going back during brunch on the weekend : -rrb- 
5		i like sprouts , though there is none too close to my house . <sssss> i do find them when i and out and about , here and there . <sssss> sprouts has a good price on everything . <sssss> we got wonderful lobster tails there and buffalo steak . <sssss> for a great surf and turf dinner . <sssss> both the lobster and the buffalo steaks were great ! <sssss> ca n't beat it . <sssss> lobster tails were only $ 6.00 a each ! <sssss> lots of good things to choose from here and .5 cents off your bill for every bag you in . 
5		as a vegetarian , i will tell you that this place is one of my favorites ! <sssss> i am in love with both their massage salad and their kaleidoscope salad . <sssss> . <sssss> both of these have kale as a base . <sssss> . <sssss> they also have ` heartier '' fare for my non-vegan/vegetarian boyfriend such as sandwiches and wraps my boyfriend loves the basil pesto focaccia . <sssss> unfortunately , the cafe is only open for lunch but i am holding out hope that they eventually extend their hours . <sssss> . 
5		i 've been wanting a breakfast restaurant like this in our neighborhood for years . <sssss> the wait was worth it . <sssss> i had the 5 egg white scramble with fruit instead of potatoes , and whole wheat toast . <sssss> there was no extra charge for the fruit , it was a good sized bowl with cantalope , honeydew , watermelon , strawberries , bananas and grapes . <sssss> everything was fresh , from the veggies in my scramble to all of the fruit . <sssss> the food is really good quality , certainly as good as scramble , over easy and liberty market . <sssss> even the bread used for toast was exceptional . <sssss> they did a good remodel of the place . <sssss> when it was gino 's coast to coast , it was dark and dingy . <sssss> they recovered the booths , redid the table tops , brought in new chairs and lighting , and gave the place a coat of light , fresh paint inside and out . <sssss> at last , we 've got a wonderful breakfast place , without driving all over town . <sssss> we will be regulars . 
5		i love echo coffee . <sssss> this is a great study spot with delicious lattes . 
5		big city burrito is downstairs of vista del sol , so right across the street from asu on apache blvd , close to rural . <sssss> i 've been here twice . <sssss> the first time i ordered the vegetarian burrito . <sssss> it takes a little longer than having a meat burrito , because they cook that to order . <sssss> it took only about 5 minutes . <sssss> so the wait was not long at all . <sssss> there are many types of tortillas to choose from . <sssss> there is white , spinach , tomato-chili , wheat , and more ! <sssss> there are also two sizes , regular -lrb- which i think is 10 in -rrb- and super -lrb- which i think is 12 in -rrb- . <sssss> then you can choose what salsas you want in your burrito , black or pinto beans , rice , and guacamole and sour cream for an additional cost . <sssss> the first time i had the vegetarian burrito , as i mentioned before . <sssss> it was very good . <sssss> i came around 9pm . <sssss> -lrb- they are open really late -rrb- . <sssss> the food was very good and the service was great . <sssss> the girl who works there is a vegetarian , so she recommended me to try the potato burrito next time . <sssss> when i went in there today , it was a complete different staff . <sssss> the service was still good , just not as great as the first time . <sssss> i ended up ordering the potato burrito on the tomato-chile tortilla , which was great . <sssss> i will definitely be coming back to this place . <sssss> pros : good food quick good service reasonable prices cons : if you do not go to asu , hard to find parking . 
5		i 've never actually been here -lrb- always had someone go and get it -rrb- and the only thing i can rate are their cheesesteaks because that is all i have ever had . <sssss> based on that alone , it gets 5 . <sssss> it is the most authentic cheesesteak that i have had in the phx . <sssss> shredded steak , melted cheese throughout , not just shredded steak on a slice of cheese , and the bread , oh the bread . <sssss> that 's all . <sssss> no cheese whiz , no lettuce , tomato , peppers ... just cheese and steak . <sssss> and it 's heaven . 
5		this place rocks , plain and simple . <sssss> these people know what they 're doing . <sssss> they have a special that i love - a croissant stuffed with rosemary lemon chicken with some sauce and omg , it is delicious . <sssss> it came with a spring mix side salad with feta and a yummy housemade vinaigrette . <sssss> i wish it was a regular dish because i 've been thinking about it for the past two months . <sssss> the macaroons are 3 bucks a piece , but they are worth it . <sssss> i 've tried almost all of them and the best ones are raspberry rose and caramel - buttery and oh so good . 
5		i love this restaurant . <sssss> you can get fast food , without being treated like you 're eating at a fast food restaurant . <sssss> there are live , growing flowers on every table , free wi-fi , impeccably kept restrooms and dining area , little cups of cheerios to keep small fry entertained while waiting for meals , the list goes on and on . <sssss> every wednesday is family night , with a different entertainer like a baloon artist -lrb- who wo n't accept tips -rrb- , a magician , and others . <sssss> they help out local schools with fundraising nights and accept any coupon , expired or not . <sssss> these are just a few of the reasons that this place deserves five stars . <sssss> amazing -lrb- they also do online ordering . <sssss> how cool is that ? -rrb- 
5		being a local , we always forget about some of the amazing restaurants at local resorts . <sssss> i 've heard many great things about ristorante tuscany , so we finally tried it . <sssss> so glad we did . <sssss> everything on the menu looked delicious , so we actually asked the staff for recommendations . <sssss> chef matt was spot on with everything he recommended . <sssss> his passion for quality comes through in every dish . <sssss> everything exceeded our expectations ! <sssss> we started off with an antipasti plate with assorted meats and cheeses . <sssss> amazing ! <sssss> next , we had the scallops atop sweet corn . <sssss> the scallops were cooked perfectly . <sssss> the sweet corn with the creamy sauce was delicious too , and i really wanted to lick the plate . <sssss> next came the main entrees : short rib risotto . <sssss> what fantastic flavors ! <sssss> nice and tender with great flavors . <sssss> veal saltimboca-cooked perfectly . <sssss> the sauce was fantastic . <sssss> glad we had extra bread , so we could soak up the bread in the delicious sauce ! <sssss> of course we saved room for dessert ! <sssss> tiramisu . <sssss> wow ! <sssss> whatever you do , save room this . <sssss> pure decadence . <sssss> it took a lot of will power , but i managed to save some of the dessert and brought it home to enjoy with my coffee the next morning . <sssss> thank god for leftovers ! 
5		this is one of the best restaurants in all of phoenix area , but you have to sit at the chef 's table . <sssss> my wife and i spend every birthday dinner with razz . <sssss> he is a character behind the bar and enjoys a good scotch while he cooks for you . <sssss> each course gets better and better . <sssss> most of the time , 80 % of the tastings are new , so it is always a fresh experience . <sssss> the food is amazing with some amazing sauces . <sssss> do yourself a favor and eat here , but call and request dinner at the bar with the chef . <sssss> he rocks and the food rocks ! <sssss> the wine selection is usually by smaller vineyards that are hard to come by and great price points . 
5		fry 's on thomas has a personable staff . <sssss> joey is especially conscientious and takes care of business . <sssss> peggy is a hard worker , as well a great store to shop . 
5		great custard just like back home . <sssss> their italian ice and cream ice are also great . <sssss> give them a try you wont be disappointed ! 
5		went to the gyro house for lunch today . <sssss> my sister has been telling me about this place for awhile . <sssss> i was n't disappointed . <sssss> family run business . <sssss> marlene -lrb- i hope i got your name right ? -rrb- <sssss> was awesome ! <sssss> the beef gyro was excellent . <sssss> the pita bread warm and so fresh it must 've been made this morning . <sssss> i used to by pita bread back in oxnard from a greek bakery so i know good pita bread ! <sssss> anyway , the gyro had just the right amount of meat with a great sauce , lettuce , tomatoes etc. . <sssss> it came with big fat fries cooked to perfection . <sssss> ordered the baklava to go and it was delicious ! <sssss> my only regret is this place is n't closer ! 
5		the best donuts every way thanks bosa 
5		you know super target is the greatest invention ever . <sssss> not only do i love target shopping , but now you give me a reason to go once a week . <sssss> thank you target . <sssss> this place is always clean and well lit . <sssss> there are never annoying intercom interruptions like at walmart and the people who work there are always helpful . <sssss> the food selection is pretty standard but they offer great prices that easily beat safeway and bashas . <sssss> i wish their produce selection was better but it 's still pretty good . <sssss> the `` stuff '' section of target is always the best . <sssss> i love their quality items and their great prices . <sssss> you really ca n't beat it . <sssss> the best thing about target is that they put money back into the community . <sssss> they are responsible for keeping the children 's museum open for free on first fridays and they donate part of their profits to local schools . <sssss> target you rock ! <sssss> also , you are on the light rail which , to say the least , kicks serious butt . 
5		dr. bass and her staff are top notch . <sssss> they are very friendly and most importantly , real . <sssss> they made me feel like i had been coming there for years . <sssss> dr. bass is by far the best o.d. i have been too . <sssss> she took the time to really evaluate my vision and when it came time to recommend a contact len 's , she picked the perfect one . <sssss> i would highly recommend dr. bass and excel vision to anyone looking for a doctor that is good at fitting contact lenses or just an over all great experience . 
5		i had my first pita jungle experience today and i was extremely impressed . <sssss> i 'm a socal guy , so i 'm not sure how far and wide this chain reaches in the phoenix area ... if the pita jungle owner happens to catch this post , please come to los angeles . <sssss> the food was fantastic . <sssss> we ordered : falafel pita philly chicken pita broiled chicken pita veggie garden wrap the chicken was perfectly seasoned . <sssss> i personally had the philly chicken pita and it was smothered in delicious melted swiss cheese . <sssss> generally , you might think something like that would be loaded with fat and calories , but a quick check of pitajungle.com shows the philly pita to only have 730 calories . <sssss> pretty much all of their offerings are below 1000 calories and relatively low in fat as well . <sssss> the open-kitchen concept is interesting too . <sssss> the bonus : you get to see how your food is made . <sssss> the negative : you get to see who makes your food :-p there was a beefy fellow with a neck full of tats and hickeys making the food . <sssss> classy ! <sssss> this place is awesome . <sssss> if you 're in the phoenix area ... get some ! 
5		my visit was on 9/28/2013 , and it was my first time there . <sssss> it was a busy saturday and they had plenty of staff working to meet the needs of the customers . <sssss> during my short 15 min visit there i witnessed 3 different customers come in with battery problems , and many more for others . <sssss> that time of the year i guess ... every employee was busy helping assist someone . <sssss> after they finished with one they would move on to the next . <sssss> on two different occasions i witnessed autozone employees go outside and help someone diagnose/treat somebodies problems . <sssss> all the while they seemed to be friendly about doing it . <sssss> no bad attitudes whatsoever . <sssss> i even witnessed good communication between the staff on where tools where placed last . <sssss> this place ran well . <sssss> i would like to thank carlos for his help . <sssss> he did an exceptional job . 
5		fantastic bakery !! <sssss> we have gotten macaroons here so many times and they are always delicious . <sssss> the chocolate is to die for . <sssss> where ever you are this is well worth your drive . 
5		this was the most awesome comic book store i 've seen . <sssss> they have some vintage toys and old collectible comic books . <sssss> the stuff is so well laid out and easy to access and the managers are so friendly and helpful . <sssss> i highly recommend this place 
5		we went here during happy hour . <sssss> we had the cashew calamari and the texas gulf oysters . <sssss> loved the calamari ! <sssss> gently fried and seasoned . <sssss> thank goodness the calamari was n't fried to the point of hard and nonexistent . <sssss> the veggies in the rest of the dish were perfectly seasoned . <sssss> the gulf oysters were obviously fresh , and had three types of condiments , which truly added and not over-whelmed . <sssss> the grey goose drink on the happy hour menu was the best i 've had . <sssss> because the food and drinks and service were so fabulous , i suggested our next gal pal birthday party event be at wildfish on the waterfront . 
5		hands down the best wine bar in phoenix . <sssss> great atmosphere , music , deals and wine . <sssss> this is the number one place on my list for those who have a sophisticated pallet . <sssss> it is busy there for a reason and definitely worth the wait . 
5		its not so much the coffee -lrb- its great -rrb- or the food/donuts -lrb- they are great as well -rrb- , its the service and the smiles they give you when you walk in the door . <sssss> every employee there is great , friendly , up beat and fun . <sssss> this is my place in the morning . 
5		to anyone who is hesitant , let me preach : 1/2 sandwich - get the turkey cranberry -lrb- only a fool would choose otherwise -rrb- 1/2 soup - all of them are grade a fancy to the max free cookie ?! <sssss> this chocolate chip cookie is more than a food article ; it 's an experience . <sssss> prepare yourself for the most mouth-watering , precious dessert god has graced this earth with . <sssss> and weep , dear soul , for now you are nourished with the greatest cookie in human history . <sssss> wipe away that single glorious tear from your face and smile , food warrior . <sssss> until you meet again . 
5		i stopped in hear some months ago because it was within steps of my old stopping grounds . <sssss> we walked in to a fun and energetic atmosphere that was simultaneously inviting and simple . <sssss> as i looked over the menu i was unsure which direction to take because of all the fantastic options presented before me . <sssss> finally , i asked the waiter for his recommendation for this lost patron , he steered me in the direction of the osso bucco which is presented on the house made spaetzle , i must say i can not remember the last time i had such a great meal , it was so tender it just fell off the bone and right into my mouth ! <sssss> truly amazing . <sssss> for desert we shared the smores that were accompanied with the chocolate bacon , my favorite two items , and together they create a ridiculous taste explosion in your mouth . <sssss> . <sssss> trust me you need to order this . <sssss> thank you beckett 's for a great dinning experience . 
5		i really like their bagels . <sssss> their bagels remind of panera 's . <sssss> -lrb- east coast -rrb- 
5		crankin ' it up to 5 stars after last night 's duck , my last few meals , and the last wine dinner - consistency of service has improved , which is what held me back from the 5 stars previously . <sssss> combine the improved service with last night 's to-die-for good dinner and i can no longer hold back number 5 . <sssss> i can not believe i 'd never ordered the thursday-only roast duck before . <sssss> wow . <sssss> the husband and i shared , and it was more than filling . <sssss> we started by sharing the burrata and heirloom tomato salad . <sssss> i tell ya ' i wished i had a whole one - utterly delectable . <sssss> we also ordered brussels spouts on the side -lrb- `` what ? '' <sssss> you say ? <sssss> `` anne ordered a vegetable ??? '' -rrb- <sssss> and even that was tasty . <sssss> all the butter probably had something to do with it . <sssss> i also had a nice burgundy for about $ 11.00 -lrb- post-happy hour -rrb- . <sssss> i still think they have the best selection and quality of wines by the glass i 've seen at any restaurant in the valley . <sssss> my first review mentioned a wine dinner . <sssss> last month we attended another one and the only problem was my stomach space could not accommodate everything my tastebuds were enjoying . <sssss> veal cheeks . <sssss> pigeon . <sssss> do n't scrunch your face up like that - have you tasted christopher 's pigeon ??? <sssss> the wines were excellent but i kept forgetting to drink , being so enthralled with the food . <sssss> hmmm ... maybe i 'll go back for lunch today ... 
5		i gave up coffee about 2 years ago . <sssss> . <sssss> most of the coffees i drink now a days make me jittery because its too strong . <sssss> the coffee shop has such good coffee , kind of like a mix between tea + coffee ! <sssss> i atmosphere is really nice and open . <sssss> we ordered their american breakfast and chorizo burrito . <sssss> american breakfast - eggs were cooked to perfection and the wheat bread was so good , not dry like most kinds . <sssss> chorizo burrito - overall really good but too much potato . <sssss> should opt for no potato next time . <sssss> i liked it so much i told my boyfriend we have to come for brunch this weekend ! 
5		trustworthy , thorough , quality work i 've been taking my car to advanced auto for over 10 years , and they 've always treated me right . <sssss> two weeks ago when i walked in and told mike i 'd made a last minute decision to drive my 1999 jeep across the desert to san diego later that day , he asked , `` how can i support you with that ? '' <sssss> what a perfect response ! <sssss> they fit me in to their morning schedule to change the oil , check tires , belts , hoses and water levels , told me that i was good to go , and gave me a heads up on what i 'd need to attend to in the next 6 months or so to keep my car running . <sssss> great , great guys and great service !! 
5		took my wife there for our anniversary and we loved it ! <sssss> great food and great atmosphere ! 
5		nice staff ! <sssss> great sandwiches ! <sssss> great coffee and drinks ! <sssss> free wifi ! <sssss> and great hours ! <sssss> 6am to 9pm or 11pm -lrb- fri. & sat . -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> nice local feel . 
5		called on a monday morning after a storm and they came out same day . <sssss> took a quick look at the unit and told me by ear what was wrong and it was the same problem i had suspected , so i did n't feel there were any antics . <sssss> he gave an estimate that was very reasonable and actually complete the work for less than the estimated price . <sssss> nice , friendly , professional . <sssss> could n't ask for better . 
5		green has the best vegan food in phoenix . <sssss> weather or not if you are vegan , there is something there for you . <sssss> very artsy inside , fantastic staff , amazing `` soynamis '' aka a vegan dq blizzard . <sssss> they have a small grocery area in the front as well , all vegan but all amazing . <sssss> i always get their special without even looking and have never been let down . <sssss> the spicy po boy , and the mexicali burger are my fav off the menu , you also get a side and i never stray from the delicious curry pasta salad . <sssss> on top of it all , they are very fair priced , 2 meals , 2 drinks , and 2 deserts , usually runs about $ 20 . <sssss> that 's great for in house made healthy food . 
5		this place never disappoints me . <sssss> this is the first time i went during their bloody mary bar for sunday brunch . <sssss> the service was immaculate , the food was awesome , especially the grilled pork my wife had ... it had excellent flavor . <sssss> i must say , i made a really good bloody mary . <sssss> their baked goods like the muffin i had and the cornbread my guests had were delicious . <sssss> the waitress was excellent as by brother-in-law asked if the burgers were messy and she picked up on the hint and brought him a `` messy '' burger with lots of bbq sauce . <sssss> to top it off , the hostess sat us under the flag of my home state ... texas ! 
5		great food and wonderful environment . <sssss> sat outside on patio ; very enjoyable . <sssss> i had the chorizo brizza , breakfast parfait and oj . <sssss> -lrb- yes , way too much food . <sssss> i 'm eating the rest of my brizza and parfait for dinner right now ! -rrb- <sssss> highly recommend the brizza . <sssss> so good ! <sssss> customer service was wonderful , too . <sssss> i went inside to get a to go box , and was looking around for about 10 seconds . <sssss> before i had the opportunity to ask for one , i was approached by someone who worked there inquiring how he could help me . 
5		my favorite pizza place in az. . <sssss> i got my usual sun dried tomato and cheese pizza . <sssss> as always it was great . <sssss> they cook your pizza in a brick oven with coal so you get a nice smoky flavor on the crust . <sssss> this place is amazing if you have n't been you got ta go . 
5		i started coming here when it was still called lion 's den and all i can say is that i absolutely enjoy going there almost every day . <sssss> sure , schedules and instructors have changed , but i am still pushed to my limits everyday and i truly recommend that everyone gives this place a chance and come to one of the best places to train in the valley . 
5		note : the earlier review -lrb- from 2007 -rrb- is when a different church occupied the building . <sssss> the newer review -lrb- from 2011 -rrb- is when new vision center was in the building . <sssss> lest anyone get confused making sense of the two previous reviews . <sssss> as ronney stated , it is a welcome , inclusive environment based upon universal spiritual ideas . <sssss> if you 're a fundamentalist christian , you 'd think they 're satanists . <sssss> if you 're catholic christian , you 'd think they 're satanists . <sssss> in other words , they do n't take the bible -lrb- or any sacred text -rrb- to be so word-for-word literal . <sssss> in fact , it 's not a christian-based teaching per se , though it is religious science , which is `` new thought , '' a spiritual lineage that has its roots in the early 1900 's . <sssss> sir arthur conan doyle , who wrote `` sherlock holmes , '' would have loved new vision . <sssss> new vision has classes and discussions about a course in miracles , eckhart tolle , `` the secret , '' stuff like that . <sssss> they have classes and workshops throughout the week . <sssss> sometimes , different groups in different classrooms . <sssss> however , and this is a big however worth noting , the congregation is 80-90 % baby boomers and seniors with maybe 10-20 % generation x'ers and young adults . <sssss> that leads to a not-very-exciting music ministry where you 'll typically hear the boomer-groovy likes of joe cocker , john lennon , even show tunes ... but you 're not likely to hear any of the guest artists covering `` true colors '' -lrb- cyndi lauper -rrb- , `` days '' -lrb- the kinks -rrb- , or `` i 'll be your mirror '' -lrb- velvet underground . -rrb- <sssss> that makes for a very weird experience at church : hearing your parents - and grandparents - favorite music at church . <sssss> not a good way to attract young people to your church . <sssss> good people , loving people , but if you 're not a baby boomer or a senior citizen , you 'll probably need to go a few times to get to know them . <sssss> otherwise , you 'll begin to feel out of place real quick . 
5		me and my wife tried thai paradise for the first time today . <sssss> i liked the decor walking in , they do n't play out the thai theme as much as thai basil , but it had a more contemporary look . <sssss> i was excited to try their thai iced tea as it is one of my favorite beverages , and i was not disappointed ! <sssss> i decided to try the spicy basil , i ordered it thai hot , and my wife had the yellow curry hot . <sssss> the presentation of the food was very nice and the smell is what really got me . <sssss> very fresh and you could really smell the spices . <sssss> i was used to thai basil 's hot scale , and i think they wimp it down , maybe because i 'm a white guy ... thai paradise definitely did not though . <sssss> my wife stated it was the only time she saw me sweat eating spicy food :-rrb- the owner was very nice and we received a coupon for our next visit . <sssss> overall i would say support thai paradise , they deserve your business ! 
5		hey this place is a classic down town breakfast joint . <sssss> they sure dont need a a + review from me , but what the hell . <sssss> this place is awesome.i love riding my bike to this funky little diner . <sssss> i always get the breakfast special ; this time it was scrambled eggs , ham , fresh jalapenos , and pepper jack cheese , with a side of home frys . <sssss> holy sh ** it was good ! <sssss> everything is super fresh , affordable , and clean . <sssss> the portions are big , so be mindful of spiting with a friend if so inclined . <sssss> also i would recommend getting your delicious food to go and sit in the park just to the south . <sssss> the wait to sit inside can be very long . 
5		this is the best greek restaurant i 've been to in arizona . <sssss> besides the food , the service is second to none , and the place is always very clean . <sssss> it 's well worth the drive , no matter what part of the valley you live in . 
5		sicilian style . <sssss> great pizza . <sssss> try the grandma pizza . <sssss> it is delicious ! <sssss> the lunch special is super cheap for pasta/pizza + soda + salad for $ 5.55 + tax . <sssss> family owned and operated business . <sssss> the patio is nice and shaded . <sssss> i enjoy sitting out there on my lunch hour . <sssss> good people ! 
5		hands-down my favorite quaint romantic dinning spot in tempe . <sssss> best ambiance , cocktails , and food is to die for . <sssss> my personal favorite is the seared ahi tuna salad , but i believe it 's seasonal . 
5		the ice cream is delicious and the new owner is usually in the restaurant when we go . <sssss> i have been coming to mary coyles since childhood and love that i can now take my kids to the same great stop ! <sssss> the sweet molar is out of this world ! 
5		this dentist is special ! <sssss> all of the staff were very kind and upbeat and the facility is ideal . <sssss> my four year old son had his first x-rays taken w/o any problem and had his teeth cleaned by jo . <sssss> dr cohen & jo were so kind by using such caring , sweet words and being gentle-especially while scraping the plaque off his bottom front teeth . <sssss> it was done in such a patient manor that he did n't even complain . <sssss> the tvs and sunglasses were great . <sssss> dr cohen has more md -lrb- medical -rrb- knoweldge about children than any other dentist i have known . <sssss> dr cohen spoke with my son which resulted in a serial thumb-sucker never puting his thumb back in his mouth . <sssss> priceless ! <sssss> many thanks ! <sssss> our son asks nearly on a daily basis if he can go back to the dentist . <sssss> i think he wants to talk with dr cohen about not sucking his thumb anymore . 
5		fantastic italian food . <sssss> simple elegant menu , consisting mostly of pasta , which in this case , is a good thing . <sssss> they claim to make the pasta in-house and it shows . <sssss> the pastas are delicate and delicious . <sssss> all of the sauces have a richness of flavor and complexity that seems to come only from the fine-tuning of several generations of family chefs . <sssss> there are many more elegant dishes , but i prefer the lasagna most of all . <sssss> it is melty and rich and hearty , all without being too heavy . <sssss> a classic soul-food done to perfection . <sssss> it is moderately expensive , with entrees that run from 16-25 dollars . <sssss> in any other city this would seem a little too expensive , but in scottsdale it 's practically a bargain . <sssss> the restaurant is very comfortable inside , but it is hidden in a strip mall . <sssss> do n't let the location fool you , the food really is fantastic , even if it 's neighbors are a dairy queen and a hair salon . 
5		dined here this evening . <sssss> the food was excellent . <sssss> the presentation was also excellent . <sssss> our waiter was very knowledgeable of the menu and very professional . <sssss> service was top notch . <sssss> we dined on the steakhouse side . <sssss> there is another part of the restaurant that is family style all you can eat . <sssss> that part was packed with people which tells me the food there is good as well . <sssss> i will definitely dine here again . 
5		amazing . <sssss> just a darn good burger . <sssss> got the arizona , pulled off half the jalapenos , de-lish ! <sssss> great service , manager was very nice and makes sure military is discounted all the time . <sssss> the place is clean and comfortable . <sssss> the smash fries are so so , not my thing , but i am glad i tried them . <sssss> going here will not save your soul , but you 'll be glad you tried it . 
5		went here for a birthday party , great atmosphere , and setting for dinner . <sssss> date night specials on sunday and monday for dinner do are a steal that include a bottle of wine . 
5		the first time i went i was n't impressed but i 've been back multiple times now and it 's become one of my favorites in arcadia . <sssss> the sunday brunch is one of the best deals around - $ 10 for a meal and either a beer or a mimosa . <sssss> the meals are all quite good and the mimosas are strong . <sssss> above average bloodys as well , two great porches -lrb- front and back -rrb- that are a little too comfortable . <sssss> also dog friendly so if you have a social pooch be sure to take him/her with . <sssss> and , of course , the beer selection is top notch , though twice now i 've settled on a favorite only to find them replace it in their cycle . <sssss> the price of keeping things fresh . <sssss> : -rrb- 
5		went to the ribbon cutting with the chandler chamber then promptly came back with the family the next night . <sssss> can you say the best creamed corn in the world ? <sssss> awsone brisket and great staff 
5		unique . <sssss> funky . <sssss> stylish . <sssss> accessories galore . <sssss> shoes , handbags , belts , jewlery ... and only the hardlest to find must have items of the season . <sssss> the best boutique in the valley . <sssss> trust me . <sssss> the store is small but packed . <sssss> you will feel like you are inside a 3-d version of shopbop.com . <sssss> if only this was my closet ... dare to dream ... 
5		fajitas is by far the best place for ... fajitas . <sssss> the homemade tortillas are some of the best in the city . <sssss> i am not sure if any of the other mexican food is even any good here because i have been going here for years and only order the cadillac and chicken combo platter of fajitas . <sssss> the salsa is very good if you like fresh tasting salsa that is very runny . <sssss> the guac is n't always very good but the meat and toppings go well with the dish . <sssss> the atmosphere is supper casual and the bar sits in the middle which isnt very large but this place gets super busy in the evening and there is alot of energy in the place . <sssss> i have been going here for years and i cant think of a single time the service was not fast and great . <sssss> i highly recommend trying it out if you are in the area . 
5		good old fashioned italian food their salad lasagna was excellent when i 'm back in az u will see me there lol but really 
5		i do n't drink beer but i love the food here . <sssss> everything on the menu , and i mean everything is great ! <sssss> i especially like that they have `` gardein '' vegetarian selections . <sssss> i have friends that are vegetarians so it is nice that we can go somewhere and they are not stuck with just a salad or a baked potato . <sssss> the service is spot on , and the wait staff is knowledgeable of their menu and can answer any question . <sssss> i make a stop here every time i 'm in the valley . 
5		love this place ... the atmosphere , drinks and food . <sssss> sam is god 's gift to bartenders , hands down . <sssss> rosie 's is a gem in the rough in the camelback corridor . 
5		by far the best mexican food i 've had so far . <sssss> their enchiladas rock ! <sssss> the best margaritas in town !!! <sssss> i never taste the tequila and all i need is one margarita . <sssss> i love their chips and salsa . <sssss> their servers are always nice and very attentive . <sssss> definitely try this place out ! 
5		had not heard about this little gem till i got a groupon for there . <sssss> it 's in a great location in old town . <sssss> the place is super cute like an old fashion ice cream parlor . <sssss> all the flavors delicious and you ca n't go wrong with any of them . <sssss> will definitely be stopping by here again 
5		i tried this place for lunch today and really enjoyed the food and the pricing . <sssss> the owners ' little girl opened up the door for my wife and i . <sssss> the whole family seemed excited to see customers and was very hospitable . <sssss> this place occupies the old meatballz -lrb- next to habanero 's -rrb- and is very modern and has pleny of tables and elbow room . <sssss> they cook the usual assortment of chinese dishes and serve sushi as well . <sssss> this place is fast food that is cooked to order . <sssss> they probably have over 30 dishes that they prepare . <sssss> i had the sesame chicken , which was served with fried rice and a vegetable egg roll . <sssss> there was a heaping portion of chicken and it was delicious . <sssss> my wife had an out of body experience with the shrimp lo mein . <sssss> she could n't believe how many shrimps there were plus she was raving about how tasty the noodles were . <sssss> all of this for about $ 8 per person -lrb- we had one soft drink -rrb- . <sssss> also they have diet dr pepper which is a major selling point for me . <sssss> needless to say , we will be back to try the rest of the menu . 
5		it 's been several months since my last visit and i still recall the flavors of the individual ingredients on my pizza . <sssss> amazing ! <sssss> -lrb- ummmm , especially after polishing off a bottle of wine or two while waiting -rrb- . <sssss> there 's a reason i wo n't go here more than once a year or so . <sssss> i refuse to wait several hours to be seated at any restaurant . <sssss> it makes no sense for the customer that bianco wo n't take reservations . <sssss> our only recourse ... follow the advice of others here and go find a better way to spend your waiting time than spending money on wine and appetizers . <sssss> but seriously , the pizza is amazing and memorable . 
5		this was by far one of the best places i 've tried , and i 'm always seeking good places to eat . <sssss> it was pretty much third time lucky when i ate there last week - one time , the girlfriend was too tired to eat out , at christmas we got there to find they closed early . <sssss> so it was pretty much a last attempt and boy ! <sssss> am i glad i persevered . <sssss> i do n't care if the logic of the theme fails , as someone noted humorously - the food is good , awesomely good . <sssss> add in friendly service and a pretty good wine selection and you 've got yourself a fun evening . <sssss> this is a small place and seating is limited . <sssss> but once you get your foot in the door be prepared for a gastronomical experience past compare . <sssss> i tried the risotto with chorizo and it was melt-in-your mouth delicious ; my gf reported equal delight in her gnocchi with vegetables . <sssss> to top it off we split a desert of chilli-flavored chocolate sauce with a pastry . <sssss> unusual to say the least and very , very good . <sssss> we had to sit on the patio so we missed out on one of their attractions - the open kitchen where you can see your food being prepared . <sssss> that would have been interesting to watch as well . <sssss> perhaps next time , and there most certainly will be a next time , though i have to drive from tempe to downtown for it ! <sssss> by the way , do n't forget to rub the stomach of the centurion by the door as you enter , you may get a free dinner !!! 
5		the food was execellent , love the shrimp scampi and the bizookie ! <sssss> the portions are big . <sssss> customer service was excellent i will definately be back ! 
5		love this place ... the wait can be a little long but there is a nice park next door so a great walk to kill some time and worth the wait . <sssss> the fresh squeezed juices are amazing -lrb- grapefruit is my fave -rrb- , great coffee and great food . <sssss> i 'm torn between the chicken sandwich and the burger ... i had the green chile chedder burger today and it was by far the best burger i 've had . <sssss> yum yum ... 
5		the pasty is in the corner of a pretty nondescript strip mall , and was tricky to locate the first time , but i am so glad that the cornish pasty and i found each other . <sssss> i love coming here with friends for a great beer and a pasty ! <sssss> the decor is a mix of traditional pub fittings and industrial touches , and there 's a pretty hip soundtrack on to match . <sssss> the atmosphere and the servers are casual , but i ca n't say that i 've had bad service here before . <sssss> the pasties are fresh and flaky -lrb- note : they can take time to bake up ! -rrb- <sssss> ; the bread pudding took me to heaven : warm , chocolatey and oh so rich ! <sssss> i also recommend the broccoli and cauliflower cheese bake . 
5		lives up to the local fuss . <sssss> quick , cheap , tasty and one of the few fast mexican food restaurants that utilize yellow cheese , which is my cardinal rule of good mexican food . 
5		best thai food in the valley and consistent from one restaurant to another ! <sssss> the thai basil house special sauté is one of my favorites . <sssss> the red green and yellow curries are marvelous too . <sssss> always super fresh ingredients . <sssss> we 'll be back . 
5		i love this barber shop . <sssss> other shops are charging $ 30 or $ 40 or more for a good hair cut/trim , but david nails it for only $ 13 . <sssss> he knows who i am on sight , he remembers my haircut , and he gets it done quickly . <sssss> to top it off , he shaves my neck with a straight razor and hot lather , and he even scissor trims my old-man eyebrows . <sssss> i highly recommend this barber shop if you 're in need of a quality cut for a great price . 
5		my mom lives near here and i stop by on occasion . <sssss> mom gets chile rellano a lot with cheese enchiladas . <sssss> i love chips , salsa and the refried beans with cheese . <sssss> i love cheese enciladas too . <sssss> they are clean . <sssss> i 've known places like this to taste/smell of pinesol . <sssss> glad that this one does not . <sssss> everything is flavorful and good . <sssss> i 'll go back for more . 
5		abel , victor , and especially ismael have been my barbers . <sssss> they are all great craft men and good to talk to and get to know . <sssss> i would definitely make a stop here if you want a good haircut . <sssss> i have actually been spoiled as a result of having these guys as a resource . <sssss> i could not find a good barber in austin , only in houston and now that i live in florida i think i finally found a good one here . 
5		rock n roll fingers is at least a weekly treat to myself . <sssss> as the other reviewers have already pointed out , their health department scores are no less then stellar , and the service is exceptional . <sssss> every time i have been there , i have been warmly greeted by the owner , and we are now on a first name basis , so the people claiming he is rude is somewhat odd to me . <sssss> back to the food . <sssss> this is some of the best fried chicken i have ever had . <sssss> its always juicy , tender , and freshly made . <sssss> i love buffalo sauce , so i always end up getting ranch and buffalo on the side , but the special sauce is also great . <sssss> i highly recommend this place to anyone that is looking for some of the freshest fried chicken around . <sssss> if you like buffalo chicken like me , its a defacto standard for great chicken and buffalo sauce . 
5		the vig has definitely become one of my very favorite spots , so i am doing an update . <sssss> you absolutely have to sit out on the patio for the best experience ! <sssss> especially this time of year -lrb- early spring -rrb- . <sssss> try the artichoke dip and the alfredo tortellini with a glass of the kung fu girl riesling . <sssss> i 'm serious . <sssss> if you do n't , you are making the worst mistake of your life ! <sssss> the service is always friendly and pretty quick . <sssss> pam , the manager , is normally bopping around making sure everything is running smooth . <sssss> i do n't mind walking across the street to park , and it is super cool that they have the vig rig ... a free van that will pick you up and take you home , all for a tip ! <sssss> i have never taken the rig , but i keep the card handy in my wallet should i ever have an insatiable need to visit the vig once i am already imbibed . <sssss> or without vehicle . <sssss> also , it is worth a trip to the bathrooms . <sssss> they are really cool and smell so great ! 
5		10/24/12 crust celebrated its 5th year anniversary today , and as it has in the past four years , it did so by offering 50 % off everything on the menu , dine-in only . <sssss> glasses of wine and and a handful of cocktails were also offered for $ 5 each . <sssss> we celebrated by ordering a strawberry salad , meatball sliders http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aphiz1xxenwjkp8mkre4dg?select=sklo5itlhcyc-7ktq097pq#sklo5itlhcyc-7ktq097pq , filet mignon sliders http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aphiz1xxenwjkp8mkre4dg?select=9nbwbmur1igaydraqyfp6w#9nbwbmur1igaydraqyfp6w , a rustica bianca -lrb- sub artichokes for the tomatoes , $ 1.50 extra -rrb- http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aphiz1xxenwjkp8mkre4dg?select=gbqv2d_ozeapawm7ih7eiw#gbqv2d_ozeapawm7ih7eiw , two glasses of mango moscato , and a glass of hey mambo , a red blend . <sssss> oh , and an order of warm chocolate chip cookies and ice cream sandwich http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aphiz1xxenwjkp8mkre4dg?select=85xw1x9f7gzbplarkjzehg#85xw1x9f7gzbplarkjzehg . <sssss> all were , of course , delightful , although the rustica was n't as crispy as mom and i wanted it . <sssss> no matter , as i pointed out that we can toast the leftover pizza at home and just enjoy the other items we ordered at the restaurant . <sssss> an hour and a half later , our stomachs full , my wallet $ 72 lighter -lrb- which included a $ 17 tip -rrb- , and my ears ringing from the deafening noise indoors -lrb- my second complaint , which i can overlook on this special date -rrb- , we left happy and contented . <sssss> thank you , crust ! <sssss> congratulations again to mitch , michael , and duke , and everyone else at crust , for yet another anniversary milestone , and we hope you have many more ! 
5		this place was , in a word , awesome . <sssss> for those who do n't know , one of my favorite places in the world is sammy 's roumanian steakhouse in manhattan . <sssss> this place actually reminds me a lot of that place , which is great to have right in my neighborhood -lrb- not to mention right next to my favorite strip club , but that 's another review -rrb- . <sssss> came here with a group of ladies on saturday night , and we had so much fun . <sssss> i mean , how many items need to be delivered to your table on fire before you start having a good time ? <sssss> hint : it does n't take many . <sssss> however , our mid-twenties asses were put to shame by the biggest party animal of the night , 90 year old mildred . <sssss> this chick was celebrating her birthday with 75 of her closest friends and was scooting around that place with a vengeance . <sssss> it was incredible . <sssss> according to the wonderful owners we chatted with , she e-vited her guests . <sssss> yes , a 90 year old woman learned how to e-vite specifically to invite 75 friends to bacchanal . <sssss> that may not be entirely accurate , but i would n't doubt it . <sssss> i had the veal bacchanal , aimee h. had the lamb skewer , and our two friends had the greek lasagna and the lamb shank . <sssss> my veal was very good , but the lamb shank that i tried was incredible ! <sssss> like fall off the bone tender . <sssss> but it was huge , and i was filling up on wine and ouzo , so i was satisfied with my bites . <sssss> really though , the experience itself is worth five stars . <sssss> yes , the food is n't inexpensive -lrb- around $ 15 - $ 20 for an entree ... but they have a gyro plate for $ 10 as well -rrb- , but they could have charged $ 5 at the door for the entertainment alone . <sssss> belly dancers , a live band , freaking throwing plates on the ground ! <sssss> obviously , the way to any girl 's heart is condoned destruction of property , so they did a great job recognizing that . <sssss> okay this is a long review , but go when they have the belly dancers and band , get the lamb and some ouzo shots , and throw some plates on the ground . <sssss> if you do n't have a good time , you should maybe re-evaluate your definition of `` good time '' . <sssss> that is all . 
5		i went to rustlers with my entire family last night for my grandparents 50th anniversary !! <sssss> i am an arizona native and personally have never seen the place i call home look so pretty and almost big ! <sssss> i personally enjoyed the food we had a set menu and the food just kept coming out everything from their biscuts to the cotton candy was excellent . <sssss> i thought it was never gon na end , everything was served family style but out of the 27 of us there not one of us had a single complaint , all of our main courses came out at the exact same time no complaints , we got the kids meals first which i found nice since kids can get restless in a place were your trying to actually dine ! <sssss> the casual attire is nice , kids love the slide , my daughter loved looking at the city lights also , workers are very hospitable all in all one of the nicest places i 've been to and i would love to go again whether its for another family outing or just my husband and i . <sssss> the only thing i would have a complaint about is the steep walking if you do n't do valet and its defanitly not easy if you have to carry a seven month baby up hill so i recomend getting a babysitter for the tiny ones but two and older i would say your good to go ! 
5		what ?!!! <sssss> i can now grab my favorite pizza any day of the week ! <sssss> whoo hoo !!! <sssss> seriously one of the best pizza pies in town . <sssss> i walked in knowing exactly what i wanted , but i am always up for trying more , and so happy i did ! <sssss> my meal included two mac n cheeses , the mushroom and the jalepeno with bacon -lrb- i always add bacon , it makes everything better ;-rrb- haha ! -rrb- <sssss> , both were creamy and flavorful , i highly recommend them ! <sssss> my signature pizza , the testosteroni , perfect as always with a crispy delicious crust . <sssss> spud fingers which were a nice surprise , as i 'm not always a huge fan of fingerling potatoes , but they were awesome and the ranch/dill dipping sauce was a great touch ! <sssss> and finally , the jalepeno poppers , mmmm . <sssss> that 's all :-rrb- proud to say , i finished everything ! <sssss> yep , this girl knows how to eat :d !! <sssss> on top of the delicious food , they have created a great environment with booths , couches , bar seating and tv 's if your watching a game ! <sssss> awesome spot , tasty food , super nice staff ! <sssss> you must go ! <sssss> i will be back ... . <sssss> a lot ! <sssss> : d 
5		this is it , folks . <sssss> this is the best brick-oven pizza in the country , contest over . <sssss> i now re-route and re-schedule to make sure this is on the travel agenda whenever i 'm out west . 
5		i love the duck ! <sssss> my mom has taken me here for years growing up and i always loved their sammies and pickles . <sssss> this last weekend a friend hosted a bridal shower for me on the patio and it was an amazing time . <sssss> i did n't know you could reserve a private patio and it had the perfect mix of sun and shade . <sssss> we had sammies and fruit salad catered and bought a few bottles of champagne . <sssss> what else do you really need for a good time ? <sssss> we ended up staying a little longer than our 3 hour reservation and never felt any pressure to hurry up or leave . <sssss> we still heard the live music and got the energy of the other patrons while having our privacy . <sssss> food was tasty as always . <sssss> fresh veggies , hearty bread and i love that pine nuts are in the veggie . <sssss> one of the best lunch spots ever ! 
5		a vegetarian reviewing a bbq restaurant ? <sssss> well here goes ... on a recent trip to visit some family , we were taken to joe 's real bbq . <sssss> everyone in the group was carnivores and all indulged in what smelled like some really good tasting bbq . <sssss> smokey pecan wood aroma filled the restaurant ... and surrounding neighborhood . <sssss> i ca n't speak for the meats that everyone else enjoyed , but the salad i had was really good . <sssss> bbq ranch dressing was very tasty ! <sssss> their bbq sauce is really good . <sssss> their mac n cheese was extremely good . <sssss> i had to go back for another serving of that . <sssss> their cornbread was really good too ! <sssss> fun atmosphere . <sssss> very friendly staff . <sssss> highly recommended , even by this vegetarian ! 
5		love this place !! <sssss> a little of everything !! <sssss> lunch , dinner , desserts , snacks , pan dulce , aguas , and it 's cleaner than most places that offer that much ! 
5		my favorite place to eat ! <sssss> bacon wrapped filet and twice baked potatoes with an amazing wine list ! 
5		if you want wine and have no idea what you 're doing , ask for help . <sssss> they truely know their stuff . <sssss> all recommendations have been great ! <sssss> they have wine classes and my favorite beer the optimator ! <sssss> coupons sometimes in newspaper or online . 
5		omg , their ice cream is soooooo good . <sssss> we had just visited superstition farm where we heard about this place and was curious to try it out . <sssss> glad we did ! <sssss> seriously , their ice cream was to die for and i wish there was a place i could get it in buckeye ! <sssss> at the farm , we bought their yogurt and for the past couple of days , i 've been mixing it with sprout 's granola and it is soooo good . <sssss> ship this stuff out to my side of town !! <sssss> please !! 
5		this is my regular coffee spot , even though it 's not even the closest starbucks to my home . <sssss> the employees are fantastic . <sssss> they always greet me and my grandparents by name . <sssss> they have all our drink orders memorized . <sssss> they make the best drinks by far of any location i 've ever been to . <sssss> if they do n't make it right they go above and beyond to make it right for you for free . <sssss> my only complaint is that they have n't hired me yet ! <sssss> ; -rrb- 
5		i was enchanted just upon entering this place -lrb- see pics -rrb- it only got better once i was inside even though it was a pretty small place , approx . <sssss> 10 tables . <sssss> it was dark for ambiance but brightly decorated , white linen tables , fresh flowers on each table , parrots mirrors etc.etc . <sssss> we started with the guacamole and tostadas with a salsa trio -lrb- see pics -rrb- pico de gallo , chipotle and the most divine fresh tomatillo salsa i have ever tasted , i was literally eating it with a spoon once the chips ran out ! <sssss> everything was so fresh and tasty ! <sssss> we also ordered a watermelon agua fresca which was so refreshingly delicious , even though i 'm not sure it was a good mix with mexican food -lrb- we took it to go -rrb- i ordered the enfrijoladas : homemade corn tortillas filled with chicken and topped with a black bean sauce -lrb- see pics -rrb- wow ! <sssss> this was so perfect i can even begin to tell you how much i loved it ! <sssss> my guest ordered the farolitos al carbon with chicken -lrb- see pics -rrb- the taco came with rice speckled with fresh veggies like corn and chiles along with a bowl of soupy pintos . <sssss> another amazing dish even though the tacos were pretty spicy overall it was all very fresh and flavorful . <sssss> unfortunately we did not have room for dessert , but that 's just one more reason to come back . <sssss> did i mention the waitstaff team ... . <sssss> . <sssss> impeccable service ! <sssss> my glass never emptied , in fact it never even got half full . <sssss> i ca n't forget the man on guitar , i mean who does n't love being serenaded during lunch ! <sssss> a definite must try folks ! <sssss> you do n't know what your missin ' ! 
5		cool vibes , good energy , and even better drinks . <sssss> if you are downtown , this place is a must ! 
5		we like to go to thai dressing -lrb- formerly thai pots -rrb- for lunch . <sssss> their green , red , yellow , and panang curry are to die for . <sssss> our favorite dish for takeout is baking seafood curry . <sssss> the food is very good . <sssss> the service is very friendly and authentic . <sssss> we love to support locally owned / run businesses . <sssss> thai dressing is one of them ! <sssss> note : they have moved to a new location in the same plaza -lrb- 2820 s alma sc hool rd , next to big 5 sporting goods -rrb- . 
5		beyond the nostalgia , i just really love this place . <sssss> i 've been with this library since i was in kindergarten - they were in another building then . <sssss> it 's grown into a brilliant place to find the books you need , or to get work done in one of the private rooms . 
5		delicious martinis half off on wednesdays !!! <sssss> tried the tickled pink and the fizz ! <sssss> yummm !!! <sssss> food is tasty also ! 
5		this place is so consistent without fail . <sssss> i come here to have brunch with my fam , before we head back to san diego . <sssss> we 're here strictly for the fried chicken and waffles . <sssss> the fried chicken is so delish and always , always , always juicy . <sssss> i ca n't complain about this place and ca n't dock a star for it because we always love dropping by here . <sssss> the staff is efficient and friendly . <sssss> service for food is pretty quick . <sssss> but , then again , we 're always here when it opens . <sssss> got ta love me so lolos whenever we 're in town . <sssss> i 'll even take some to go , thank you very much ! 
5		omg , this place is great . <sssss> its clean and organized . <sssss> the produce look delicious and colorful . <sssss> i found items that i would not have found any other store . <sssss> i wished i would have came here sooner . <sssss> i will not be shopping here all the time , but for specialty items i will visit this place . <sssss> well reading through a review from an employee that works there ... this place sounds like a terrible place to work . 
5		some of the best pizza i 've eaten . <sssss> ihadvery good cheese on top was great thank you very much for a great time the only bad thing is i have to fly home t san francisco tomorrow but i would like to thank michelle for being a great hostess she 's not michelle she 's from new jersey but i had a great time thank you very much 
5		my friend and i went on a 2 hour trail ride this past week and had a great time ! <sssss> nicole was our guide , and i do n't think i 've ever met someone so genuinely pleasant and sweet . <sssss> she was so knowledgeable , filled with cool facts about the area , personable and showed genuine interest in everyone in our group , and very patient with both us and the horses . <sssss> the owners and employees of this ranch clearly care for and personally know all 50 or so of their beautiful horses . <sssss> we 've taken a few other vacation rides , where we were just led slowly along the beach and back . <sssss> while the ride started with some simple wandering through the desert brush , nicole took us into a more mountainous area where we got to wind around , up and down amazing rock formations and massive saguaro cacti , spotting little desert creatures here and there -lrb- i think they only do this for the 2 hour -rrb- . <sssss> it 's so beautiful and rugged . <sssss> she even let us do a little trotting here and there when our group started to show some promise . <sssss> our group was small and the horses were really calm , great for all levels . <sssss> definitely wear long pants and closed-toe shoes because you 'll brush up against a lot of plants/shrubs , some very prickly . <sssss> todd , the owner , was also our transportation to/from our hotel and it was a treat to meet him as well . <sssss> we will definitely be back when we return to scottsdale - it felt great to support their business and i recommend you do the same ! 
5		this is my favorite ahwatukee restraunt ! <sssss> it 's damn good . <sssss> i 've been coming here since i was a kid , and i 've never even tried any of their plates ! <sssss> i only ever get a b-fast burro , # 12 with guac ! <sssss> their salsa is fantastic , i could eat it with a spoon ! <sssss> -lrb- and i have ... -rrb- dfinately give this place a try ! <sssss> mmm ! 
5		this is a rich mans taco bell , great food , family owned i think and since you got ta wait a couple minutes i 'm pretty sure at least some of the food is made to order . <sssss> they have a fantastic carne asada steak burrito but i mostly get the carne asada nachos with all the melted cheese , guacamole , meat and chips . <sssss> it 's not fast food cheap for one person -lrb- i never pay under $ 7 -rrb- but that 's why i go to the taco bell down the steak when i want to be cheap , but these guys ... ` looks right and left ' ... they got the good stuff man . 
5		one of my favorite dt phx joints ... ever . <sssss> i 've been here several times and have always had an amazing experience . <sssss> cute place , friendly staff , quick service , excellent food ... i mean , i could n't possibly ask for anything more . <sssss> the first thing you need to do is get the burrata as an app ... holy cow it 's creamy , yummy amazingness on a plate . <sssss> funghi pizza is one of my faves . <sssss> the capricciosa pizza is also delicious . <sssss> okay before i remake the entire pizza menu ... they 're all amazing , it just depends on what you 're in the mood for . <sssss> when we visit here for birthdays or other special occasions that are deserving of dessert , we always get one of the crepes that have nutella and other fun stuff in them so make sure you get one ! <sssss> they have pasta night on tuesdays and all of them i 've had in the past have been great . <sssss> each tuesday they feature two different pasta dishes , and it varies week to week . <sssss> they have a great selection of wine and are great at suggesting a certain type you 'll enjoy . <sssss> they also serve brunch and lunch . <sssss> i have n't been to either but plan to head there for brunch soon ! <sssss> : -rrb- 
5		this is seriously some of the best coffee around . <sssss> stopped by for a quick cup of coffee with a friend . <sssss> the staff was so nice and the coffee was so good , we now meet here weekly for coffee and to catch up . 
5		fabulous . <sssss> everything we had was great . <sssss> i had a southwestern omelet that was out of this world . <sssss> service is great . <sssss> if you are staying at the boulders resort , do n't waste your time and money dinning off the property for breakfast -- this place has everybody beat . 
5		these dudes customer service was top notch ! <sssss> needed repairs on my beach cruiser and these guys rocked it ! <sssss> -lrb- and they have some really cool bikes in there too . -rrb- <sssss> if you just happen to need one of those $ 6000 - $ 8000 dollar bikes , they got 'em ! 
5		the staff . <sssss> the staff made this facility , and our stay , five stars . <sssss> we have stayed in many nice resorts and the rooms , amenities and views are standard for a nice resort in a tourist area like scotttsdale . <sssss> but every single employee who came within speaking distance asked if we needed anything or if they could do anything for us . <sssss> there was a small delay at the oasis bar by the pool while the employees figured out a problem with their cash register . <sssss> we stood , unacknowledged , for a period of time waiting to get our kids some ice cream . <sssss> just as i was thinking that this is where the impressive service would break down , the smiling manager told us `` no charge , '' without a moments hesitation or any complaint from us . <sssss> i love organizations that empower their staff to provide excellent customer service . 
5		super big store which i love ! <sssss> employees are so nice and always ask if you need a bra measured or need help ! <sssss> dressing rooms are big . <sssss> semi annul sale is awesome here . <sssss> is farther from my house but thats not too big of a deal since i dont just go to scottsdale fashion square just for this store ! <sssss> is pricey thought which is sad because if it were somewhat cheaper i would shop here a lot more often ! 
5		i frequent this place for lunch since it is close to my work . <sssss> extremely glad i found it since there are not many decent and quick places to eat in the area . <sssss> i have to comment on how nice everyone is and they definitely make it a point to remember you . <sssss> i even forgot my wallet once and they just gave me the sandwich anyway , the owner said he did n't want me to waste my lunch hour driving back to the office to get it - i made it a point to go back the next day and pay for it . <sssss> they have the best wheat bread ; thick and soft slices . <sssss> i am a turkey sandwich kind of girl and they never disappoint . <sssss> their bakery selections are just like grandma used to make . <sssss> the soups seem to be pretty healthy because they are all homemade . <sssss> their hot sandwiches seem to be pretty yummy too - my bf always goes for them . 
5		super cute neighborhood , awesome atmosphere and decor with good looking people all in a great mood having fun . <sssss> excellent service , beautiful presentation and a menu you just ca n't decide on because there are so many great choices . <sssss> fun with a group , especially at the community table . <sssss> fun upbeat bar . <sssss> decor is cozy and dim but festive at the same time . <sssss> and on top of all this the good is excellent . <sssss> highlights we 're street corn with a special sauce that is reminiscent of thousand island but sweeter and zestier , yucca fries w tangy bbq sauce , caesar salad with a tex-mex twist , saucy short ribs , and pumpkin bread pudding to die for ! 
5		matt and erenia pool have done it again -lrb- finally -rrb- the proprietors fo matt 's big breakfast and the roosevelt have at long last opened their long-awaited coffee shop . <sssss> located just a block east of central and a few steps south of mcdowell ; giant coffee shares the ground floor with the equally lovely bunky boutique . <sssss> the space is wide open and amazingly designed by the architecture firm located upstairs -lrb- the merz project -rrb- . <sssss> as you might expect , if you have any experience with the downtown pool empire , the ambiance and the coffee are both exceptional . <sssss> for a space which seems so small from outside , the amount of seating is impressive . <sssss> the floor to ceiling opening front windows allow for an amazing feeling of expansive breathing room . <sssss> i have only gone once , -lrb- this morning -rrb- i had the honey0vanilla latte . <sssss> it was fantastic . <sssss> simple and sublime at once . <sssss> a more extensive menu of treats and goodies to nosh on is to follow soon . <sssss> bravo ... 
5		oh man , talk about guilty pleasure . <sssss> it 's basically snl 's `` taco town '' in real life , if you know that reference . <sssss> even the dessert fry breads are good . <sssss> and loaded . 
5		first time here , came on a sunday night for dinner . <sssss> the inside is fairly small , but cozy . <sssss> they have a large patio dining area with nice lights up , but it 's too cold for that so no one was out there . <sssss> they have some interesting menu items that i 've never seen before . <sssss> my husband and i got the fig and panela cheese salad , the hibiscus enchiladas -lrb- yep , the flowers -rrb- and the huitlacoche crepas which is apparently a type of mushroom , or fungus , that grows on corn . <sssss> sounds like we eat weird stuff huh ? <sssss> maybe so . <sssss> the salad had nice bite-size pieces of dried figs and cheese with a balsamic dressing . <sssss> the hibiscus enchiladas had a sweet/tangy flavor to them with a nice side of sauteed vegetables . <sssss> the crepas were soft and tangy with goat cheese and pomegranate sauce . <sssss> i was impressed by all three ! <sssss> they also bring out chips with two types of salsa . <sssss> good service as well ! 
5		if i could furnish my whole house in copenhagen , i would ! <sssss> my husband and i frequent this location often , and are slowly but surely starting to fill our home with copenhagen furniture . <sssss> the store is clean and well laid out , and the staff is always very friendly , helpful , and nice -lrb- unlike scottsdale -rrb- ! <sssss> the products are extremely high quality , and every so often they have some amazing discounts . <sssss> if you like modern european style furniture , this one of the few places in az that you can get it . 
5		i followed my stylist -lrb- aimee g. -rrb- here from another salon . <sssss> she 's amazing ! <sssss> i 've been going to her for about 6-7 years and i 've never been unhappy with a haircut/color . <sssss> the salon itself is very laid back and everyone that works there is friendly and helpful . <sssss> highly recommend ! 
5		took 5 bids , and their price beat all . <sssss> excellent price - excellent service on my entire house 's windows and sliding doors . <sssss> and when i had a problem with one of the sliding doors a couple months later the guy came out no problem . <sssss> excellent customer service , too . <sssss> great company ! <sssss> ok , let me be more honest ; i had the flu over xmas , but heard tax credits were to be had if you booked before the end of the year . <sssss> so , i druuuuug my ass out of bed , made calls and saw people -lrb- from a polite distance cause i 'm not that much of a pig -rrb- and chose c&c . <sssss> never regretted it and never looked back . 
5		great sandwiches ! <sssss> skip the chains and get the real stuff here for less ! <sssss> huge selection of bottled sodas . <sssss> do not miss rocket burger & subs ! 
5		great food and amazing service . <sssss> you have a line of guys standing at the front just waiting to serve you . <sssss> great chips and decent salsa . <sssss> i love the specials board , though i am still a little hesitant to break down and try the tripas . <sssss> the seafood can be pricey but that can be expected in the middle of the deserts . <sssss> amazing enchiladas and have n't had a bad thing yet . <sssss> the dining room is massive with a couple different sections , so you typically do n't have to wait , though there are a lot of people there . <sssss> it can be a little scary looking from the outside since it is right off the freeway in a fairly scarce neighborhood . <sssss> there is also a security guard in the parking lot to add some mystique . <sssss> however , once you get yourself in the restaurant you are put to ease by the comfortable seating and laid back atmosphere . <sssss> typically too stuffed for dessert , so someone else will have to clue you in on that . 
5		i love this place . <sssss> i come here a couple times a week for lunch . <sssss> fast lunch time service . <sssss> i get there when they open and i am able to get back to work in no time at all . <sssss> i have had several things on the menu and everything is great . <sssss> they make mine triple thai spicy for me and it is perfect . <sssss> a couple of my all time favorites are spicy eggplant with beef and pad kee mow . 
5		i started out on the suicide plate and i 'm still here . <sssss> i think i just have to accept it that i 've either burned out my palette or the general public ca n't tell really spicy from a hole in the ground . <sssss> it 's not a macho thing peppers are my anti drug . <sssss> :-rrb- you get the heart racing , cold sweats , paranoia that you 're never coming down . <sssss> so while this one is n't bava or choco the panda is still good shit . <sssss> the taste tour and instructions on filling out the menu are a very nice introduction to what one reviewer has called a food court fight . <sssss> i have to agree . <sssss> i came from scotland and in the afternoon the chinese restaurants opened , yep chinese food was an evening item . <sssss> the first time i say it in a mall at 10am i just had to have it , it just was n't done , not very . <sssss> . <sssss> british :-rrb- neither was mixing it with an order from the italian , i could have invented mamma bandidos years back :d keeping that history in mind i was so ready to love this place after reading the reviews . <sssss> after pollo diablo , jerk rice , jerk chicken and the black bean plate i will marry this store if prop 102 does n't mess that up too . <sssss> i 'll still cheat on her with pizza a metro but i think the italian part will understand :-rrb- ok the pollo diablo was crispy better than any buffet attempt , or most low to mid chinese eateries not tough in the middle , full of garlic and damn it 's good . <sssss> so good that i am glad the recipe for that is up on the food network site and plan to make this soon . <sssss> the rice and beans on their own are again better than i expected it . <sssss> they are doing better rice than most mexican , better stir fry than most chinese and better jerks than a team of jamaican weightlifters . <sssss> in short i do n't care about the canteen feeling , the cutlery or the tin dishes -lrb- hand to pop a lid on to take leftovers in . <sssss> . <sssss> should i ever leave any -rrb- the sum of these parts really adds up to a greater whole in the wall and my smile can , i believe , be seen from space . <sssss> j 
5		once again a fabulous breakfast ! <sssss> green flannel was amazing and my friend got the veggie hash which she said was delicious ! <sssss> while there is a wait , order a bloody mary -lrb- or a delirium which my friend said was light and crispy -rrb- and take in the great patrons ! <sssss> we sat at the bar which was fun and had the best service ! <sssss> oooh , and do n't forget the olive bread with whatever you order ; it 's so yummy ! <sssss> great service and great food ! 
5		as soon as you walk in you feel like you have arrived somewhere special . <sssss> we were there right before the holidays and had the pleasure of sitting next to what must of been a regular although he looked like a celebrity of some kind an italian looking new york actor . <sssss> he was eating the most incredible dishes and he recommended to us what to order the mussels are incredible , and be sure not to induldge on the bread it is addictive tasty , and the pasta fagioli soup just like in italy homemade the best . <sssss> be sure to save room for dessert , the cannollis are mouth watering . <sssss> we will return and hopefully the new york actor lookalike is there again . 
5		i am not a big sub sandwich eater . <sssss> i 've tried many of them - subway , quizno 's , jason 's deli , eegee 's ... . <sssss> etc. . <sssss> besides eegee 's -lrb- which is really good -rrb- , i just thought they were all decent sandwiches - some better than others . <sssss> but i have had jersey mike 's a handful of times now , and their sandwiches are much better than the others . <sssss> just get it `` mike 's way '' and enjoy the tasty food you receive . <sssss> but just as importantly , the customer service i have received at this store has been impeccable . <sssss> the people are always very friendly and patient and that makes a huge difference to me . <sssss> i must say that their sandwiches are a little pricier than others . <sssss> i get their `` giant '' size -lrb- ok - so i 'm a big eater ... -rrb- at it runs about 12 bucks ... yikes ! <sssss> but as delicious as it is , it 's worth it . <sssss> try it - you wo n't be sorry ... 
5		attention eagles fans !!!!! <sssss> if you do n't know already , this is an eagle 's bar during football season . <sssss> and it ... . <sssss> . <sssss> is ... . <sssss> awesome . <sssss> being a huge fan myself , imagine one sunday , rolling in to what i thought would just be another normal bar where i would catch the game but instead , stumbling into eagles territory with the flags , the jerseys , and the offical song ringing through the speakers . <sssss> i swear i blacked out for a little bit . <sssss> so since then this has become my fave sportsbar ! <sssss> the two-story layout is awesome and really gets the crowd into the game . <sssss> there are screens everywhere so there is n't really a bad seat in the house . <sssss> the food is good , above-average bar standards like burgers , wings , wraps , and nachos . 
5		my favorite store ! <sssss> very pricey even with a student discount i 've learned 2 pretend 2 be a ai student and get my windsors there @ the ai student store along with prismas . <sssss> ai student store is cheap on culinary kits as well & aaron brothers has better quality brushes 
5		went to lunch here today . <sssss> had the chicago dog with fries and a few bites of the steakburger -lrb- not that i wouldnt have eaten more -rrb- the fries are awesome here ! <sssss> i love the thin shoestring fries . <sssss> the dog was good , it was on a great bun . <sssss> no complaints at all ! <sssss> i had a few bites of the steakburger from my girlfriend . <sssss> she wouldnt let me eat it all ! <sssss> haha so i was done eating and was like oh what the hell lets get the custard ... i tried the brownie delight = delicious . <sssss> very smooth and probably the best frozen `` ice cream '' i 've ever tried . <sssss> i will be back and will make a special trip to try more stuff !! 
5		like no other place in the neighborhood ! <sssss> this colorful little restaurant really stands out in arcadia . <sssss> the patio is just plain wow !! <sssss> hanging out at the bar , sitting next to the fireplace and enjoying a coffee beer just ca n't be beat . <sssss> the food has been great , most recently i enjoyed the ragu , which was really great . <sssss> the sauce was tasty and the meat was different than i was expecting , but way better than anything else i have tried elsewhere ! <sssss> i have also tried a few of their pizzas and have always been very happy . <sssss> from food and drinks to a great staff , this place has really outdone themselves . <sssss> i am a fan and will be back . 
5		we loved the ambiance , loved the location , loved the food , enjoyed ourselves a lot . <sssss> we are planning on going back , and write a more in depth review , once we try more on the menu ! 
5		went on a date with my husband last night . <sssss> first off , the decor is beautiful , and the ambiance is fantastic . <sssss> this is one of the coolest looking restaurants in the valley , and i have to admit we were surprised to see something so beautiful in a strip mall . <sssss> we were a little early for our reservation and had to wait at the bar before our table was ready , but even though it was really busy , the bar staff was very helpful and attentive . <sssss> i ordered an ocotillo sunset which was like a martini with peach vodka and lime , and fruit juice . <sssss> it was awesome . <sssss> i ordered another one when we sat down , and i rarely do that . <sssss> i have to confess that artichokes are one of my all time favorite foods , and they have grilled artichokes as a special . <sssss> apparently , they are n't always on the menu , but they were last night , and they were amazing . <sssss> they were perfectly grilled , and they came with a dipping sauce that was the perfect compliment . <sssss> i figured that would be the highlight of the meal but i was wrong . <sssss> i ordered the sirloin steak with a baked potato , and my husband ordered the pork chop . <sssss> both were cooked exactly as we ordered them . <sssss> odd to focus on the side dishes , but my baked potato was huge , and i ended up finishing the whole thing because it was so good , and the cole slaw that came with my husbands pork chop was really good too . <sssss> it was an asian style slaw and it was very light with just a hint of peanut flavor . <sssss> however , the highlight of the night for me was the dessert . <sssss> we almost never order dessert when we go out , but i saw the peanut butter brownie on the menu and had to try it . <sssss> first let me say that my husband ordered the creme brulee . <sssss> it 's his favorite dessert , and he really like the one from chop . <sssss> it had a lemon flavor to it , and he said it was great . <sssss> however , we both agreed that the peanut butter brownie was the better dessert by far . <sssss> all in all , fantastic meal . <sssss> chop is a bit of drive from our house , but i 'm sure we will be heading down there again . <sssss> i would highly recommend it . 
5		we came to humble pie after seeing it featured in phoenix magazine -lrb- so sad that i can never find a place on my own ... -rrb- and we were blown away . <sssss> it was a weeknight and all i wanted was some pizza to go and veg out on a couch watching a movie . <sssss> well , after waiting on our to-go order we both wished we just stayed there ! <sssss> the restaurant is so incredibly inviting with its modern yet warm decor and a brick oven smack in the middle of the restaurant . <sssss> it was warm and smelled nice which was a bonus after walking from a car in 30 degree weather -lrb- crazy winter this year , is n't it ? -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> the staff were incredibly nice and we snacked on the `` butter '' mints that were placed by the exit while waiting . <sssss> i know they are for after the meal , but we were hungry ! <sssss> anyways , the pizza was fantastic . <sssss> one word : `` sourdough '' ! <sssss> well , it 's either sourdough dough or something that tastes like it , but i thought that the pizza was fantastic ! <sssss> it is not too thin and definitely not thick . <sssss> just perfect , on my taste buds . <sssss> we had parmesan chicken pizza -lrb- i think -rrb- and a margherita pizza . <sssss> both were phenomenal . <sssss> we also ordered some french fries that were likewise super yummy . <sssss> as an aside , i was raised in nyc , which is famous for its pizza . <sssss> i have to say that humble pie 's pizza is at least as good as new york pizza . <sssss> i will definitely come back , and i can not wait to try a date night -lrb- thursday after 6 pm : an appetizer , pizza , and two salads for $ 20 -rrb- . <sssss> also , apparently there are like 10 different food places in that general area on 7th street -- time to check them out ! 
5		this is easily the best airport food i 've ever had . <sssss> the kale salad was fresh , well-balanced , delicious , and filling . <sssss> i could barely even believe it . <sssss> if you have to get a meal in the airport , make the trek from whatever terminal you 're in over to la grande orange ! 
5		this was the absolute epitome of perfect date night spot ! <sssss> we heard about it from a good friend , and boy was she right ! <sssss> get the bruscetta to share -lrb- $ 14 -rrb- and it 's a meal ! <sssss> you absolutely must have the brie , apple , and fig sauce bruscetta ! <sssss> you will literally be licking the board , it is just so delicious ! <sssss> i am not usually one for wine bars -lrb- i do n't drink wine , but my boyfriend does -rrb- and the wine was almost expensive per glass as the food , but he said it was worth it . <sssss> if you are prepared to spend $ 9 + a glass , then it 's worth every cent . <sssss> it 's not much from the outside , which actually almost deterred us , but do n't turn back ! <sssss> it 's dark and romantic , but also edgy and hipster-ish . <sssss> they have $ 20 bruscetta and bottle of wine nights on monday and tuesday after close , and i can not wait to go back . <sssss> i live in mesa , but it 's worth the drive all the way to phoenix ! 
5		this place is worth the drive through the ` hood . <sssss> it 's mexican food the way that your mexican grandmother would have cooked it . <sssss> total home style ... but seriously super spicy . <sssss> i 'm a fan of spicy foods , so i love los dos , but if you do n't like it spicy , you 'd better stick with taco bell or macayo 's . <sssss> definitely 5 star food . <sssss> i frickin ' love this place !!! 
5		barrio raises the bar . <sssss> i feel ... like every other place that i gave 5 stars should be knocked down a star . <sssss> this is what real 5 stars is . <sssss> i do n't know what i liked better : the service , my enchiladas , my margaritas , or my churros . <sssss> i 'm totally serious . <sssss> i loved this place . <sssss> holy hell . <sssss> could you imagine if this place was closer to me ? <sssss> i 'd be broke as a joke and obese . <sssss> i loved this place . <sssss> i do n't know what else to say about that . 
5		i happened upon this store the day they opened a while back and thought it was great . <sssss> then went in again a few days ago and it really is going to be a great store . <sssss> i purchased quite a bit . <sssss> they have very good used clothing from designer things down . <sssss> i think that the owner has a great eye for what she is accepting on consignment . <sssss> i did consign some things too . <sssss> it is right next to a department store outlet but i do n't remember the name on scottsdale rd and frank lloyd wright . 
5		wife and i went with the in-laws as we wanted to explore a little of phoenix before we had to come back home to the cold . <sssss> this place was cool . <sssss> intricately built art exhibits surrounded by some of the most beautiful desert flora i 've ever seen . <sssss> several native american rebuilds of homesteads throughout the grounds helped give to the illusion of how things used to be . <sssss> military id got me in free , which is always clutch , and those who did have to pay , did n't pay a whole bunch . 
5		now this is what i 'm talking about ! <sssss> my boyfriend and i have been looking for a bar and grill type place to be regulars at and i think we finally found one . <sssss> due to the high ratings on yelp we decided to head on over for a friday night with food and music . <sssss> our server was very pleasant and helpful . <sssss> also when we told her her this was our first time visiting she let the owner know , who came over and introduced herself ! <sssss> we thought that was very personable and pretty cool . <sssss> it 's nice that the owner likes to keep herself present which probably makes for a better running establishment . <sssss> we did n't want to get overly full so we decided to share a few appetizers . <sssss> we ordered a dozen medium/honey wings , a basket of fried zucchini , and a basket of their fries . <sssss> the wings were wonderful ! <sssss> thinnly breaded and fried and then they even throw them back on the grill . <sssss> they had that wonderful grilled flavor to them . <sssss> the fried zucchini was a generous portion and they were so packed full of flavor . <sssss> i 'm picky about fried zucchini and these were awesome . <sssss> their fries are beer battered which are literally the best kind of fries your can possibly have . <sssss> everything came out piping hot and tasted delicious . <sssss> i had water with lemons -lrb- i had been drinking soda all day ... yikes -rrb- but my boyfriend enjoyed his huge beer . <sssss> also we found out they have 40c wings on tuesday 's ! <sssss> we normally go to native new yorker but i think we 're going to start coming here . <sssss> i just wish they had more flavors to choose from . <sssss> maybe they 'll start adding some ! <sssss> the restaurant itself was clean and so comfortable . <sssss> it 's a pretty good sized place with an outdoor patio , an area with bartop tables and a third area , where we sat , with booths . <sssss> the places is decorated with sports memorabilia and a lot of tvs . <sssss> i liked that they had a large variety of options playing so there was something for everyone ; basketball , boxing , snowboarding , golf , hockey , etc. . <sssss> . <sssss> at 9:30 pm a band came in to play , chuck e baby was the name i believe . <sssss> they were great ! <sssss> they kept the audience entertained between songs and took requests as well as played some of their original pieces . <sssss> ck 's website has a band schedules which is thursdays-saturdays and there is never a cover charge . <sssss> we had a fantastic time and ca n't wait to go back ! 
5		wow ! <sssss> the rumors are absolutely true.sooooo good !!! <sssss> first time to fez and i have wanted to visit for quite a while . <sssss> their happy hour prices are quite nice and the bottled beer was frosty-cold . <sssss> i had to have one of their burgers and was not disappointed . <sssss> i had the tangier burger with hummus , herb pesto , sun-dried tomatoes , and manchego cheese . <sssss> got this not in their delicious ciabatta , but on romaine lettuce . <sssss> so crisp , fresh , juicy , delicious . <sssss> side salad had a splash of their delicious homemade dressing too . <sssss> hubby and son had the fez burger with spicy honey molasses bbq sauce , cinnamon pears , feta cheese , lemon aioli , crispy onions , and cilantro . <sssss> they had theirs on the ciabatta bread and i had a bite or two for myself . <sssss> oh ... man - so good . <sssss> their sweet potato fries are the best i have ever had and i try them everywhere i go . <sssss> dear fez , we 'll be back again and again . 
5		my husband and i been going to malee 's for such a long time and really love it . <sssss> deirdre , the owner is such a warm and wonderful person . <sssss> we finally went to one of the cooking classes this afternoon which was bought for us a a gift from my daughter , andrea . <sssss> we really enjoyed it and it was well worth it . <sssss> learned so much about thai cooking . <sssss> we learned how to make crispy basil chicken , red thai curry paste , roasted chili reduction sauce & tom ka gai soup . <sssss> everything was so delicious . <sssss> anybody wanting to try some thai food need to go to malee 's . <sssss> their coco chili fish & drunken dragon noodles are favorites of our 's . <sssss> thanks deirdre , chis & meche for making our cooking lesson memorable . <sssss> we definitely will have to do it again . <sssss> erma 
5		just went to boa bistro/caffe boa today . <sssss> they have an awesome outdoor seating area that is great to enjoy this wonderful weather . <sssss> the caprese panini , so cal love salad , and voodoo penne vodka were all amazing . <sssss> no , i did n't order all of them in one sitting but i did do a bit of sampling . <sssss> :-rrb- i would highly recommend going because it does n't seem to be too busy and they have a huge list of wines i 'm looking forward to trying . 
5		love . <sssss> so great . <sssss> i had the secret bbq chicken sandwich - mock chicken with caramelized onions and peppers in espresso bbq sauce with vegan mayo and thyme fries . <sssss> hubby had the texas mushroom po boy . <sssss> both really great tasting , soft bun - messy , good stuff ! <sssss> we also had the crab puffs - very tasty . <sssss> i headed next door to nami to get some iced coffees and a oatmeal cookie sandwich and peanut butter cupcake to go . <sssss> also totally fabulous ! <sssss> will be back for sure . 
5		bronze bar rocks ! <sssss> i arrived on time and i did n't have to wait at all . <sssss> they were punctual which i appreciate . <sssss> my tan lasted longer than any other spray tan . 
5		i do n't think i 've ever had a better meal in all of arizona . <sssss> if there were 10 stars , shinbay would get them all . <sssss> mmm . <sssss> we did the tasting menu . <sssss> the starter was a halibut sashimi in a ponzu like sauce . <sssss> typically , you would n't think of halibut as being the go to sashimi , but it was prepared perfectly and ca n't think of a better sashimi dish . <sssss> the next course was a bento box with different small apps . <sssss> each one was better than the last . <sssss> we especially enjoyed the oyster and uni . <sssss> the third dish was a mushroom soup . <sssss> it was phenomenal ! <sssss> the fourth dish was a `` cook your own '' wagyu . <sssss> at first we were hesitant to do this , but once we realized how amazing this meat was we could n't get enough . <sssss> the final dish -lrb- and surprisingly the best -rrb- was a plate of nigiri . <sssss> every piece was perfectly done and so fresh . <sssss> this was the best nigiri we have found anywhere in az. . <sssss> for desert we had a custard with fruit that was the perfect ending to the tasting . <sssss> overall , the prices are very high , but extremely worth it . <sssss> alcohol prices are reasonable . <sssss> this is a truly perfect spot for any special occasion ! 
5		this place is awesome , had a small wreck and insurance totaled it . <sssss> i let zen fix it out of my own expense and the price was very reasonable and my bike looks sexy as hell . <sssss> they spent extra time trying to make it look real nice . <sssss> way better than other shops out there . <sssss> labor was lower than all other shops i checked out . <sssss> thanks dillon 
5		my husband and i had a great lunch here . <sssss> very tasty and interesting combinations of ingredients . <sssss> great service from brenna , too ! <sssss> looking forward to our next visit . 
5		i am 100 % for supporting little business , especially coffee houses . <sssss> i 've been to roots , lux , next , and elevate and this place can compare . <sssss> small , cozy and simply good coffee . <sssss> do n't forget to try their muffins ; i believe they are from a local bakery in sun city . <sssss> last visit i was able to spend a few minutes talking to the owner ... family style place keeping this location low-key . <sssss> i 'd suggest it for an after-date night hang out or a quick cup to go . <sssss> either way , get the chance to enjoy : -rrb- 
5		it seems to me that the last comment should have been more of a compliment than a complaint . <sssss> i sincerely doubt that michael h. never contacted this business , phone numbers and credit applications do n't just fall out of the sky . <sssss> if you applied for a loan and he made multiple attempts to follow up to your inquiry , i 'd say he 's doing great ! <sssss> i am a business partner of mike kortas and i can say that he has been nothing but outstanding in every regard to mortgage lending . <sssss> he has a true desire to serve his clients and serve them well . <sssss> if your only complaint online is that you 're too thorough i would say you 're doing something right ! <sssss> thanks for everything mike ! 
5		we had the best experience with moving team six . <sssss> they were cheaper than two men and a truck and most of the other main companies , and they did n't nickel and dime us with charges depending on the size/weight/number of boxes , etc. . <sssss> we just told them we had a three story place with two bedrooms and gave them a ballpark of boxes and big items , and they gave us a rate right away . <sssss> all the other guys wanted up to 48 hours to get back to us , after asking for a complete inventory of our stuff - with measurements , etc. . <sssss> they showed up right on time , moved very quickly , and were also very careful with our stuff . <sssss> they knew exactly how to wrap the items to protect them . <sssss> they were also very friendly and moved everything exactly where we needed it . <sssss> i never plan on using any other moving company ! 
5		ok , it 's time to admit it , this is one of my top 10 favorite places in phoenix and it 's a crime i have waited this long to give it the full 5 stars it deserves . <sssss> great staff , great atmosphere , and $ 5 pitchers and glasses of wine on sat and sun afternoons ... just imagine how all of this can improve your love life , social life , married life , life life ... are you imagining ? <sssss> i do n't think you are ... fine , do n't imagine , get on your cruiser , keds , vespa , pinto and get over to postino for the best bruschetta in town , top 10 wine selection , rotating beers , and top 5 patio . 
5		sad to see this place closed : -lrb- 
5		outstandingly -lrb- is that a word ? -rrb- <sssss> fantastic staff , -lrb- howdy phillip and gang -rrb- , great cupcakes , best peach ice tea eva , and from what i hear the sangria is to die for . <sssss> -lrb- i was done drinking for the night -rrb- i went to a yelp elite event and part of our tour was a stop here . <sssss> i have been wanting to hit their qc grove location for a while now . <sssss> i will definitely have to do that . <sssss> the shop part has the strangest , wonderful , and most delightful olives , oils , and beauty products . <sssss> chocolate or bacon olive oil anyone ? <sssss> lol 
5		went again last weekend with my husband . <sssss> had the same fabulous server - thanks michael ! <sssss> and they had changed the bun on the burger . <sssss> much easier to hold . <sssss> still have `` short '' fries . <sssss> guess it 's the belgian thing ... do n't know . <sssss> anyway , got to sit outside and it was really nice . <sssss> give them a try - i do n't want them to go away ... 
5		had my first short leash dog at the food truck friday a few weeks ago and i 'm hooked . <sssss> i had the special , the mac daddy - hot dog -lrb- i chose the spicy dog -rrb- with chili , and mac and cheese on warm nan bread . <sssss> damn ! <sssss> i will be frequently their brink and mortar store as soon as they open . <sssss> so many wieners so little time ... there 's a t-shirt in there somewhere : -rrb- 
5		if you were ever even questioning eyelash extensions . <sssss> . <sssss> the answer is yes . <sssss> layla creates the most beautiful set of lusciously long lashes , they literally change the way you view yourself . <sssss> i got my very first set a few months ago and am completely obsessed . <sssss> i wake up every morning feeling extra pretty . <sssss> not only is my morning make-up time cut in half , but the results are twice as nice ;-rrb- the lashes are soft and delicate , yet durable ; these heavy-duty beauties even hold up in the ocean and swimming pool ! <sssss> i am constantly receiving compliments on how precise and real they look . <sssss> it makes me giggle when people tell me how long and beautiful my lashes are . <sssss> . <sssss> although i sometimes find it slightly difficult to give up my little beauty secret , it is just too amazing not to share . <sssss> above all these exciting new things i have experienced after getting winked , i love the fact that my boyfriend compliments on how amazing i look every single day . <sssss> do yourself a favor -lrb- and a big ego boost -rrb- you wo n't be unimpressed !! 
5		great experience , randy and gary are great ! <sssss> my son , wife and i stopped in and picked up some scooter parts . <sssss> wheels , bearings and got a helmet.had a great time and got treated with great respect , randy even talked about how important it is for my 8 year old should be wearing safety gear . <sssss> we will definitely be back to buy more scooter parts . <sssss> thank you tom claire and jordan

5		we eat lunch here at least once a week . <sssss> excellent food and service . <sssss> best bets : elephant garlic chicken , chicken pad thai -lrb- hot ! -rrb- <sssss> and green papaya salad . <sssss> thai barbecue chicken is also very good . 
5		cell phone and pda repairs !!!! <sssss> wonderful lifesaver -lrb- and wallet saver as well0 . <sssss> i thought i was going to have to replace my 14 month old blackberry after the side-wheel gave out . <sssss> i was referred to sun cellular by a at&t sales person who knew that replacing my blackberry would run over $ 300 . <sssss> this place runs a brisk but dependable and reasonably priced business . <sssss> for $ 50 the proprietor fixed a problem that would have cost me over $ 300 -lrb- new blackberry , activation , accessories , etc -rrb- . <sssss> sun cellular fixed it in under an hour -lrb- most repairs are done on the spot though you can leave it for service -rrb- and during that time multiple customers came in and he was able to address most of their problems for $ 20 - $ 40 each . 
5		the best subs i have ever had going back before we leave for home . <sssss> when we get home open one up so i can get subs on the regular . <sssss> portland needs one sub shop to rule them all !

5		had breakfast here this morning against my better judgement as i have had a couple of bad experiences in the past at this location and took my business to the one on thomas . <sssss> however it was a nice surprise today the food was excellent and service was friendly and expedient glad to see the good egg showing this location some attention and turning things around . 
5		what can i say ~ i love ruth 's chris ! <sssss> from the moment i walked in i was waited on with the utmost attention . <sssss> i made a reservation for some friends and i. i arrived early so i sat at the bar and ordered some calamari -lrb- see pics -rrb- pj the bartender took very good care of me , he was funny without being obnoxious , we watched jeopardy together and he knew all the answers , he even gave me a wine tasting tour of the most expensive wines they have ! <sssss> i found a new favorite . <sssss> -lrb- whitehall lane cabernet -rrb- he was great company while i waited for my guests to arrive . <sssss> thanks pj ~ dinner was delicious as usual , although i did notice they increased their prices a bit . <sssss> i ordered shrimp cocktail , ruth 's chop salad , seared scallops and the broccoli augratin . <sssss> -lrb- see pics -rrb- i really do n't care for red meat anymore but their rib-eye is delicious if your a steak eater . <sssss> my guests ordered the filet and crab legs , tomato salad , house salad and a rib-eye and they loved every bite as well . <sssss> after dinner we relaxed for a bit on their patio complete with fireplace and the most comfy patio chairs i 've ever sat in -lrb- see pics -rrb- i spent nearly a $ 100 on my dinner alone but it was worth every delectable bite ~ 
5		riga tony 's has excellent food ! <sssss> baked riga tony w / sausage and meatballs ! <sssss> oohh yeah ! <sssss> wife and i are on our 3rd set of frequent diner cards ... -lrb- in just under 3 months -rrb- :-rrb- never had a bad meal there ! 
5		i love this place . <sssss> i have been coming here for years and they never disappoint . <sssss> the free chip assortment with your meal is always a hit . <sssss> the service is always quick . <sssss> the food is always done right and you can feed two people really well for less than $ 30 . <sssss> this is a win . <sssss> i ca n't get enough of the red sauce ontop of my burrito , so i usually get extra . <sssss> super smooth , smokey , and a nice slow heat . <sssss> this place does new mexican cuisine very well and is worth your time . 
5		five years ago i had stayed at this hotel and would have given it a wonderful review but i was not yet a member of yelp so i could not . <sssss> this time i can !! <sssss> i just got back from a 3 day stay here . <sssss> i booked my rooms directly on the marriott website so i could utilize my discount . <sssss> i returned to this hotel because it is one of the few in the area that i could find with the two bedroom two bathroom suite . <sssss> once again , this hotel did not disappoint . <sssss> they still have their free wired internet , free buffet style breakfast , heated pool and spa , and very nice rooms !! <sssss> they have done a total re-model since the last time i was here . <sssss> i did n't see anything wrong with the rooms last time but hey ... the rooms really stand out now ! <sssss> the full kitchen and living room are added bonuses . <sssss> location : this hotel is in a great location for just about everything in tempe and downtown phoenix . <sssss> it 's right across the street from the arizona mills mall ; leave your car at the hotel and walk !! <sssss> everything you could want to eat , drink , and be merry is at the mall or very close to it . <sssss> hotel is right next door to a cvs . <sssss> go there and get your bottled water and drinks . <sssss> note : do not drink the hotels bottled water or they will charge you . <sssss> across the street is a mcdonalds , wendys , home depot , 50 's diner and another 7 minute walk gives you carls jr , claim jumper & joes crab shack . <sssss> the phoenix international airport is 10 minutes away . <sssss> there 's a `` shortcut '' to the airport if you go down priest street to university but do n't use gps because it will keep trying to get you to go down i-10 ! <sssss> -lrb- which may be easier if you are prone to get lost like i am . -rrb- <sssss> employees : everyone was very nice and helpful . <sssss> housekeeping always gave me the extra towels i requested . <sssss> the woman that works the breakfast buffet was exceptionally nice . <sssss> even though the buffet closed at 9:30 am , she let me come at 9:45 to eat . <sssss> i made sure to tip her every day . <sssss> internet : free and fast ! <sssss> it is wired , yes , but to even be able to find free internet at any hotels in tempe and phoenix is amazing , especially in a suite !! <sssss> the other places i looked at wanted $ 9.99 a night !! <sssss> i did not mind one bit having to hook into the wired router . <sssss> they have a computer/printer set up in the lobby as well . <sssss> room : very clean and classy ! <sssss> tons of storage ! <sssss> -lrb- i believe all of these rooms were once apartments . -rrb- <sssss> i like the way they re-modeled everything . <sssss> clean fresh linens . <sssss> no bedbugs !! <sssss> living room and kitchen are a wonderful added bonus . <sssss> there 's also a fireplace but with it being 90º out , i did not need to use it . <sssss> the bathrooms are also very nice . <sssss> love the bow out shower curtain rods ! <sssss> the showerhead is a big ol' fancy thing ; water pressure is excellent . <sssss> tubs and sinks drained great . <sssss> lots of windows throughout the unit . <sssss> the room curtains are very good at keeping the room dark until you want to let the light in . <sssss> with the arizona sun , it was nice to open the windows but also keep the sheers in front to minimize the heat factor . <sssss> parking : free !! <sssss> yay !!! <sssss> late check out : yay !!!! <sssss> i will definitely stay here again the next time i am in phoenix . <sssss> it 's a no brainer !! 
5		its easy to get into an us vs them , west downtown vs east downtown , cibo vs bianco pissing match , but truly these places are so unique and valuable in their own way as to coexist in a culturally void downtown in a soulless metro . <sssss> cibo , however , does indeed take the lead by a very significant stretch over bianco . <sssss> first and very much foremost , the owners are absolute treasures . <sssss> they have never been anything less than engaging , charming , and overtly polite . <sssss> whether my gf and i eat there or take out , they always greets us as friends and seem to be genuinely appreciative of our business . <sssss> on one visit when i was with a large party of about 10-12 people we kinda had to squeeze into a small area in the front room , which was still quaint and comfortable , but i made an offhand joke after the owner looked concerned about my smallish seat , that she could `` make it up to me with a beer '' . <sssss> i was completely embarrassed as she really did bring me a celebration ale on the house . <sssss> she 's just an awesome lady . <sssss> their building itself is enamoring with a large patio for the pleasant autumn nights of phoenix and their interior is very cozy for a more subtle dinner . <sssss> the restaurant can be both romantic or merry . <sssss> their tiny bar is perfect for a short wait -lrb- never waited longer than 5-10 mins at most -rrb- , especially during take out where we like to enjoy their sangiovese chianti blend . <sssss> their pizza itself is delicious . <sssss> the rustica is my go-to and they tend to use generous amounts of meat and cheese -lrb- the prosciutto being my favorite -rrb- . <sssss> their portions are perfect for two people and are well-informed on how many pizzas will be ` just enough ' for your party . <sssss> also , their marscapone/nutella crepes are insanely good . <sssss> if you ever have a chance to host an event , see if they will let you use their carriage house in the back , where , come to find out after we used it for our own holiday party , had a `` recent tenant '' . <sssss> lucky dude to have cibo as a neighbor . <sssss> the back carriage house has a wine bar and a private server as well as a small patio for outside drinking/smoking . <sssss> cibo is a perfect little neighborhood pizzeria . 
5		slow but meticulously clean . <sssss> i would rather wait for something awesome than get something crappy quickly . <sssss> also great that you can get upto 5 bucks cash back when you pay with your debit card so you can tip the worker . 
5		update - first trip was a fluke , bad sandwich . <sssss> i would say steer clear of the patty melt . <sssss> we have eaten here a few times since and it has been stellar . <sssss> the custard is out of this world , the kids meals come with a free custard which is a nice touch . <sssss> i still like the burgers at in n out better , but i have definitely eaten here quite a bit more than i have there in the past couple of months so that may change . 
5		fantastic day saturday for lunch at central bistro . <sssss> the doors were all open and the breeze and light from outside were wonderful . <sssss> my lobster bisque was great and the burger hit the spot . <sssss> service was friendly and efficient . <sssss> i ca n't wait to come back . 
5		we stop by ramiro 's once a week . <sssss> the shrimp burrito and fish tacos are amazing . 
5		i 'm so glad to have this theater in my neighborhood . <sssss> great variety of films , great atmosphere , and very reasonable prices.i like that they often have a 5:30 pm movie which i can catch right after work and still be home by a reasonable hour , because i am an old person now . <sssss> and yet , they still let me in , even though i am old and creaky -lrb- 40 -rrb- and not young , hip , or hot . 
5		where to start ... fabulous smiles is conveniently located in mesa , arizona at the cross streets of brown rd. and greenfield . <sssss> the exterior is simply stunning , but the interior is even more beautiful . <sssss> the interior offers balanced combination of modern architecture and with beautiful dark colors . <sssss> the staff is very reliable and very welcoming . <sssss> as soon as i entered the rumored , `` scary dentist office '' and until the very end of my wisdom teeth extraction -lrb- i got all four pulled out at once ... it sounds scary , i know , but i promise it was n't at all -rrb- , i knew that i was in good hands . <sssss> no . <sssss> . <sssss> this is not a state farm commercial . <sssss> these people actually know how to take good care of you and your smile . <sssss> do n't take my word for it and head over to fabulous smiles yourselves .

5		i have used signature west multiple times over the past 5 years for both commercial use -lrb- a church property -rrb- and my personal residence . <sssss> i could n't be more pleased with the quality of service they provide nor with the professional manner in which they provide . <sssss> the church property i managed had the unfortunate experience of a flood - our hot water heater burst - on a saturday night ! <sssss> 1.5 inches of water across the entire facility . <sssss> they stopped the water flow , sucked up the water , cut out drywall , and got the building to a place where we could have church service by morning . <sssss> all the damage was completely repaired by the following week 's church service ! <sssss> fast ! <sssss> high quality ! <sssss> reasonably priced ! <sssss> call them ! 
5		wow ! <sssss> super busy today ! <sssss> i guess the rain drove everyone in to ikea for the day ! <sssss> per the usual , i grabbed a tasty frozen yogurt and my go-to lingonberry drink ! <sssss> we shopped the day away and made my wish list for the fall ! <sssss> ca n't wait to go back and refurnish my apartment ! <sssss> their prices are always reasonable and the staff is friendly . <sssss> have fun ! <sssss> i love ikea !

5		i 've been coming here for years - dating back to when it was in an old coffee shop on scottsdale road before they moved into the current bat cave - and the food never disappoints . <sssss> the stacked enchiladas are my favorite , complete with the fried egg on top to make everything better . <sssss> the carne avobada is always tender , and all of the dishes pack plenty of heat . <sssss> service is friendly . <sssss> you ca n't come to scottsdale and not eat here at least once . 
5		they really do a great job , and you will really pay for it . <sssss> i do n't have incredibly pricey clothing , so getting my $ 50 blouses dry cleaned here just does n't make sense - but i would absolutely trust them with very important articles -lrb- nice sport coats , lined trousers , wedding gowns , blood soaked mattresses ... haha , kidding -rrb- . 
5		okay being from maryland and loving seafood i have been on the hunt for many many years in the phoenix area for a great place for seafood . <sssss> my husband and i had a date night here this past weekend . <sssss> they did not disappoint us !!! <sssss> he had a 1/2 dozen oysters that were amazingly fresh , i had the crab cakes and let me tell you they are definetly my favorite from anywhere including back home in maryland . <sssss> for our entree we decided to split the special of the evening a seafood trio and boy am i glad we did because the portions are big and considering i had to try the crab n lobster bisque soup which i wish i had some right now . <sssss> our side we choose the crab fried rice and my husband said to me on sunday next time lets get an order of the rice to go . <sssss> desert well it was just down right sinful . <sssss> service was exceptional from the time i made the reservations to the end of our date . <sssss> tony our server was very knowledgable , and friendly . <sssss> must must try if you are in the area !!!!!

5		brand new ! <sssss> huge courtyard with amazing pool ! 
5		wife found pappadeaux on yelp , and boy am i happy she did . <sssss> we have been watching a lot of duck dynasty , and after watching mrs. k cook up a whole lotta squirrel brain jambalaya , my cajun taste buds kicked in . <sssss> we started with the frog legs and lobster egg rolls . <sssss> the frog legs were incredible , i could not believe how juicy they were . <sssss> for an entre , tasia got the scallops , and i got the blackened catfish with the dirty rice . <sssss> i loved this dish , but could barely finish half of it . <sssss> we will be back for sure 
5		i 've never finished my review for this place ... and yet i 'm here almost once a week for over a year now . <sssss> lol . <sssss> sorry david !! <sssss> the food is consistently stellar and i 've had nearly everything on the menu and a few special items off-menu as well . <sssss> the staff is very friendly and always attentive . <sssss> great for lunch and a good date spot in the evenings too . <sssss> quality drinks as it has mostly a full bar and just overall a wonderful restaurant . 
5		fantastic ! <sssss> i love this place . <sssss> good drinks , great appetizers , good atmosphere , great salads , fantastic butter cake . 
5		oh fez how i miss you ! <sssss> i have been to fez numerous times and this review is long overdue . <sssss> their scrumptious and delectible dishes are down right amazing . <sssss> the fez benedict is my all time favorite , followed by the breakfast kirsa , panini , and french toast . <sssss> but trust me everything on their menu is fantastic ! <sssss> during brunch they have $ 3 drinks which are all delicious . <sssss> the gspot is soooo good , a concauction of grapefruit vodka , ruby red grapfruit , and soda . <sssss> i also love the belini as well which is quite refreshing . <sssss> in all this place is worth a visit whether you are near or far with their mouth watering dishes and gulpable drinks ! <sssss> you wo n't be disappointed and that 's a promise ! 
5		we are hooked ! <sssss> this place is awesome . <sssss> the gelati with italian ice and frozen custard is delicious . <sssss> i highly recommend it ... 
5		atmosphere : very cozy , great for family or groups , but they have a small seating area . <sssss> service : very courteous & prompt . <sssss> food : this is now my favorite pizza place ! <sssss> we started off with some bruschetta . <sssss> it was crunchy & full of flavor . <sssss> the pepperoncini rings gave it a little kick ! <sssss> for pizza , we got the mama spinato 's `` signature '' fresh pizza . <sssss> i love the way they cut the pizza for you . <sssss> it was n't the traditional big triangular slices . <sssss> they were cut into small squares , which made it so much easier to share , and to portion yourself . <sssss> the crust is thin , so it was n't overwhelmingly doughy . <sssss> my sister ordered the same specialty pizza but gluten-free . <sssss> the crust was n't as sweet , but still good for being gluten-free . <sssss> definitely beats picazzo 's gluten-free crust in terms of taste . <sssss> i am addicted ! 
5		this is the best pan-asian supermarket i 've ever been to . <sssss> it 's a massive labyrinth of goods from korea , japan , indonesia , and other countries that will overwhelm the senses in such a good way . <sssss> lee lee is an adult toys r ' us for us asian food aficionados . <sssss> do check out their huge fruit and vegetable selection , a massive frozen foods aisle with yummy exotic ice creams and frozen breads , spices a go go , and more types of noodles and rice than you can shake a chopstick at . <sssss> one of my favorite sections in lee lee is the cooking gear aisle . <sssss> here you can find vietnamese coffee makers , ladles , pots , pans , woks , bowls , plates , and every kitchen implement imaginable . <sssss> all very affordable . <sssss> my secret fantasy is to rent out the attic of lee lee 's and move in permanently . <sssss> lee lee 's rocks ! 
5		seriously the best dinner i 've had in a very long time . <sssss> three of us dined this past monday night and it was a bit slow so we rec 'd extra special attention from the waiter . <sssss> we had the fried burrata and crisp pancetta wrapped prawns . <sssss> so yummy and succulent . <sssss> let me talk about the baby beet salad . <sssss> ohmygawd ! <sssss> i will dream of this special salad forever . <sssss> i 've never seen orange beets but simply de-lish . <sssss> also , we had the scallops , salmon , and claim pasta . <sssss> just gorg food and ever so good . <sssss> i absolutely love this place . <sssss> go . <sssss> there . <sssss> now . 
5		our other restaurant changed their egg foo recipe . <sssss> bad . <sssss> then we found tottie 's ! <sssss> good ! <sssss> this place is beautiful , the staff is happy -lrb- always a good sign ! -rrb- <sssss> and you can feel the good vibes in the air when you come in . <sssss> the ambiance is soothing and comfortable for chillin ' with friends or meeting with whomever ... really classy place . <sssss> i do n't eat sushi as i 'm a veggie , but they 've got a sushi bar that my neighbor could n't stop raving about . <sssss> he 's the reason we tried tottie 's and we are so glad we did ! <sssss> also , be ready for a sweet surprise after dinner ! <sssss> save some room , you will not be sorry ! <sssss> mmmm ...

5		stopped by on a saturday to grab a bunch of storage boxes for the office year end ... they had 2 10 packs left ... after asking if they happen to offer a rain check on the great sale price , i was quickly offered a substitute , better brand at the same cost ! <sssss> kudos ! <sssss> i got what i needed with no trip back ! <sssss> : o -rrb- 
5		i can see why this place has so many awards . <sssss> its a very well run choice brand hotel . <sssss> the hotel itself constantly has this pleasant aroma from the moment i walked in to the lobby to the room itself . <sssss> i have been checked in by different multiple front desk clerks and each time they all have been excellent . <sssss> the staff here makes sure you feel welcome and that you have anything you need . <sssss> the rooms itself all have microwave and fridges all in a built in work desk with a flat panel television . <sssss> one big plus in my book is there are plenty of outlets everywhere . <sssss> there are two outlet plugs in each lamp , with three lamps total in the room . <sssss> this is helpful so i can have my laptop and phone plugged in at the work desk while my ds and other work phones can be plugged in by the bedside . <sssss> there are plenty of restaurants just right down the road . <sssss> in the afternoon , they had cookies available in the front lobby . <sssss> there is always ice cold water available right by the elevators . <sssss> the breakfast is 6am to 9am and is the standard breakfast items such as sausage patties , eggs , bread selections , waffles , yogurt , milk , juice , etc. . <sssss> they do have express checkout so you receipt will be under your room at night to make check out a breeze . <sssss> summary front desk : 5 check in/out process : 5 room overall : 5 bathroom overall : 4 breakfast : 4 internet : 4 
5		going back to lagrande today to buy their famous english muffins to take to family in texas . <sssss> know that this place is very busy , but the food is certainly worth the wait . <sssss> i especially like purusing their gift and foodie department !! 
5		i love this place they have the best prices for the quality of food they serve and when you go there you feel welcomed . <sssss> maria and george run the place they are great super friendly , and you will always see them with a smile ! <sssss> the best for last best prime rib in town by far keep it up guys ! 
5		this restaurant really lives up to its name by being -lrb- in my opinion -rrb- the best vietnamese pho restaurant in arizona ! <sssss> i 've been to a couple of other pho joints in az that were either hit or miss , but this one sets the bar pretty high by balancing quality , flavors , cleanliness , and let 's not forget , remarkably fast & friendly service ! <sssss> i 've been to numerous pho restaurants over the last decade in both california -lrb- where i 'm from originally -rrb- and arizona to be able to decipher the difference between `` quality '' or lack-there-of . <sssss> what sets un-pho-gettable apart is that they 're able to achieve the level of deep flavor in their pho broth without the use of msg -lrb- which a lot of cheaper pho joints do to compensate for lack of quality ingredients -rrb- . <sssss> i 'm not going to knock msg for being the bad guy , because i personally feel that a little does n't hurt -lrb- it adds flavor -rrb- . <sssss> but let 's face it , if you can create a good savory dish without it , i 'm all for it . <sssss> imo , the use of msg is like cheating -lrb- adding flavor to subpar food and sometimes disguising what they do n't want you to taste -rrb- . <sssss> the owner was kind enough to give us a little background on his restaurant and how they stand behind quality ingredients and how they choose better cuts of meat , take care in preparing the pho broth -lrb- which when done right , takes a long time to infuse the flavors -rrb- , and how this is all orchestrated without the use of msg . <sssss> now , our assessment ... as soon as our food came to the table and we had our first bite , my gf -lrb- who is vietnamese by the way -rrb- agreed with me in delight that we found our new pho spot in az ! <sssss> we were just too spoiled in la , and just could n't find the right spot to fill the void in az. . <sssss> but let me tell you , the broth was full bodied and robust -lrb- the way pho broth is supposed to be -rrb- , the meat was tender and delicious , and the noodles were on point ! <sssss> we also had an order of egg rolls -lrb- cha gio -rrb- and compared to other places where i sampled this dish , you can tell the wrapper was top quality because of the crisp and texture . <sssss> sure the prices are a bit higher than some other pho restaurants , but it is well worth it to know you are paying for good quality and pho done right . <sssss> if you 're looking to try vietnamese pho for the first time or you 're -lrb- like us -rrb- just trying to find a new pho restaurant , do yourself a favor and give them a try . 
5		great honest shop . <sssss> i 've been coming to srd for almost 10 years and they always take amazing care of my cars . <sssss> in addition , their prices are more than reasonable and the staff is friendly . <sssss> if you are looking for a shop for any kind of car or truck you should come by this one . <sssss> plus they also do sandrails now ! 
5		i 'm really digging this place ! <sssss> if you like escargot and blue cheese them you will love this appetizer ! <sssss> they even give you bread to sop up the extra garlic butter ! <sssss> it will make you want to slap yo mama ! <sssss> the patio is beautiful and their margaritas are awesome ! <sssss> luv it ! 
5		the staff are very friendly and remember you when you visit repeatedly . <sssss> beautiful open dining area inside and umbrella tables outside for when you want to enjoy the view of the mountains or take in some fresh air . <sssss> pastries are just as delicious as anywhere else you will find and even have sugar free or low cal options . <sssss> i 'd highly recommend supporting this local bakery and coffee shop . <sssss> i have to edit this because i ca n't express enough how fresh the baked goods are ... i `` reverted '' to a `` popular coffeehouse '' once and was instantly reminded why i like brubaker 's ... the muffin was cold and had that `` just thawed out '' feeling . <sssss> spend the same amount at brubaker 's and get 300 % better product in the baked goods . 
5		just a heads up , do n't go here with the expectation that you 're getting authentic mexican food . <sssss> all of us zonies know that a really great authentic mexican restaurant almost always begins with a mexican woman 's name :-rrb- this place is very good for what it is , it 's a modern mexican joint . <sssss> i like the fish or carne asada tacos . <sssss> they have lemonade of all sorts , the sour kind that tastes homemade , and oh-so good if you ask me . <sssss> the creamy rice is my fav -lrb- do n't look up the ingredients , it will ruin the fun in eating it -rrb- . <sssss> the salsa is so-so . <sssss> my bf is not a fan of az mexican food , he is more of a tex-mex kinda guy , and he likes this place - great for me , since it is close by . <sssss> the decor is fun and the employees are perky . <sssss> it is also low-key place that is easy and you can go as you are . 
5		i was hungry to try a good new buffet for lunch on this monday , & my experience has been that the one 's at casinos are always excellent , so i wheeled down to harvest buffet , within harrah 's ak-chin casino , to give it a try . <sssss> upon arrival i joined the player 's club -lrb- as you should always do -rrb- . <sssss> at times this might get you the buffet for free , but at this time it only saves you a dollar but puts you on the mailing list for discounts & freebies later . <sssss> the casino is nice though , & i headed into the restaurant with lots of positive anticipation ! <sssss> the layout of the food tables reminded me of eagles buffet at casino arizona , except that this one is lighted more brightly , & has a higher , very artsy ceiling . <sssss> in fact , the entire restaurant is built with a lot of `` indian '' style , and i found it to be a completely comfortable place to eat . <sssss> i started with a tasty seafood soup that i ca n't remember the name of , salad , and then started trying the different hot choices . <sssss> the selection is large , and today there was a thai section , a mexican section , an italian section , & an american section . <sssss> there was also vegetarian fare , seafood , & more ... & everything i had room to try , about half of the main items out , was just great ! <sssss> there were lots of beautiful desserts out too , but i did n't have room for them this time . <sssss> i 'm a diner , not a gambler , but just fun , on the way out , i stuck my new `` total rewards '' card & $ 20 in a slot machine , to show a little appreciation . <sssss> as unexpected , a few minutes later i cashed out with $ 68.89 ! <sssss> needless to say , i love this place , & plan to return next monday for another terrific meal ! <sssss> the hotel & pool look inviting too , so i might just make it an overnighter . <sssss> lunch 9.99 = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = monday 6/29/09 - today it was back to harvest buffet , my favorite of all buffet restaurants in the valley ! <sssss> gadzooks it was good !! <sssss> even though i was returning on the same day of the week as last time , the food was mostly not a repeat , & it was just terrific . <sssss> yes , it 's a bit of a drive for many of us down to maricopa , but i think it 's worth it . <sssss> p.s. . <sssss> this is a good-sized place , but the secret is out about how good it is , & it pretty much fills up by about 11:30 am . <sssss> be there at 11 if you can . <sssss> = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = thu 1/14/10 - have been here several more times ... still totally 5-stars ! <sssss> the cream of mushroom soup today was soooo the best i have ever tasted !! <sssss> that 's how it goes with this place . 
5		i have gone to matt 's for lunch several times as i work nearby . <sssss> do n't be afraid to order lunch - it 's as great as breakfast . <sssss> i enjoyed both the blt and the tuna sandwich . <sssss> i go a little after 1pm and have no trouble getting a table . <sssss> do n't get me wrong - their breakfast rocks . <sssss> but do n't be afraid to go for lunch . 
5		if i could give jared blake entertainment 10 stars i would ! <sssss> jared delivered everything he promised and more ! <sssss> all of his entertainers/musicians were prompt courteous , professional and most importantly they rocked our wedding and made it an event to remember . <sssss> he made the planning and execution of my wedding entertainment a breeze . <sssss> al of our guests from ny , italy , boston , atlanta , and la raved about how amazing our wedding entertainment was and how spectular jared blake entertainment is . <sssss> i will definitely use jared blake entertainment again . 
5		i have nothing but great experiences at cork , and today 's brunch was no different . <sssss> we held a birthday brunch with 21 guests this morning there . <sssss> the service was wonderful , the food absolutely amazing . <sssss> and i do have some very picky guests ! <sssss> they do not hesitate to tell when they have a less than stellar experience , yet every one of them loved the food and loved the restaurant . <sssss> to the servers , chefs , and owners , my hat is off to every one of you for making it a perfect occasion . <sssss> to all of you reading this , get in there and have what is in my opinion the best food in the phoenix metro ! <sssss> i have eaten dinner here more than once as well , and the dinner is astounding . <sssss> i had never had the brunch before , but the brunch was amazing , and a lot more food then i was actually expecting ! 
5		amazing gym ! <sssss> coaches are great ! <sssss> their open gym and summer camp are great programs ! <sssss> hands down best place in az for gymnastics ! 
5		my hair was cut to perfection as i requested . <sssss> i will definitely have scottsdale barber shop as my new barber . <sssss> great place , quick and a terrific neighborhood feel . 
5		last night was the grand opening of sit ... stay the sit down restaurant for short leash hot dogs . <sssss> i have only had short leash one time before this at a uye that jon h. hosted . <sssss> from first bite i was in love . <sssss> so much more than just a regular hot dog . <sssss> then i heard that this restaurant was opening , i was super excited . <sssss> had to show up for the first day . <sssss> so did a lot of other people but that is a good thing . <sssss> when i got there i muscled my way inside and got my name on the list . <sssss> i was told the wait would be about an hour and a half . <sssss> that is understandable . <sssss> first night . <sssss> ton of people . <sssss> the place is not that big . <sssss> nice cozy spot . <sssss> so many people it took me awhile to realize there was a bar as well as tables . <sssss> i thought it was just a bunch of people standing in one corner . <sssss> the wait was awesome . <sssss> best wait for a table at a restaurant i have ever had . <sssss> the owners were also running around handing out hot dog pops . <sssss> little corn dogs on sticks some with jalapeno cheese in them . <sssss> it was a surprise as to which ones did . <sssss> also the nicest girl was handing out waters and refilling them for those standing around . <sssss> she had the best attitude , i think , ever for someone filling up water glasses . <sssss> as busy as it was she was super happy and excited to be refilling water . <sssss> plus she was genuinely happy that you had shown up . <sssss> the owners were very nice too . <sssss> everyone was . <sssss> so after my awesome time of waiting i finally got called . <sssss> felt like i won something . <sssss> got seated at a table with several other people in various stages of their meals . <sssss> again understandable with so many people . <sssss> waiter came over , also very nice , took drink orders . <sssss> nice girl with the water showed up again . <sssss> the menu is changed slightly from the food truck menu . <sssss> all the regular dogs are there and you can build your own . <sssss> plus they have new entrees and salads . <sssss> you can also order pitchers of beer which is great and they have kilt lifter on tap another plus . <sssss> had a little trouble picking which dog i wanted . <sssss> so many great choices . <sssss> finally got the bear . <sssss> which has the oddest list of ingredients that you would think would not work at all but it just does . <sssss> peanut butter , cracker jacks , smoked gouda cheese , bacon and bbq sauce . <sssss> crazy right ? <sssss> but soooo good . <sssss> the fact that all of their dogs are served on naan bread pushes it over the top . <sssss> drinks took awhile coming out . <sssss> again no problem . <sssss> i love the little tin trays they bring the food in . <sssss> all dogs are served with chips or a garden salad . <sssss> it was one of the best meals i have had in a long time and the hot dogs were really good too . <sssss> this place is awesome . <sssss> if you go here and just get a plain old mustard and sauerkraut dog you are doing yourself a disservice . <sssss> also do n't miss out on mamma toledo 's pie shop . <sssss> hidden in the corner . <sssss> turn left instead of right when you head towards the bathrooms . <sssss> they will shut your pie hole . <sssss> did n't try the pies but the cookie bars were really good . <sssss> if they are any indication the pies should be great . <sssss> i had an awesome time . <sssss> no one else can have as awesome of a time here as i did , it is impossible , but you will get a great hot dog though . <sssss> the best around . <sssss> even if you have to wait for it trust me it is very worth it . <sssss> there is a reason there is a wait . <sssss> they are that good . <sssss> your mind might just be blown . <sssss> it is possible . <sssss> this place has the possibility of becoming very special for me but that is just me . <sssss> only me . <sssss> i do n't want to build it up too much for everyone else . 
5		i 'll be honest . <sssss> my recollection of this place is a bit vague . <sssss> my visit was preceded by several hours of lounging by the pool , sipping homemade limoncello cocktails . <sssss> no , i did not drive . <sssss> for the record , it was early -- say , 7-ish -- on a saturday night . <sssss> what i do remember is this : the scene was casual , the folks were friendly , the jukebox rocked . <sssss> we blasted bad religion , misfits , beastie boys , and even a lil james brown . <sssss> i played pool against many strangers -lrb- and lost -rrb- . <sssss> i would go back in a heartbeat . <sssss> while rogue west shares the same name as the one in scottsdale , they are no longer affiliated with one another . <sssss> i 've been to that other one a few times before , and i must say , west is best . <sssss> and i 'm not just saying that because it 's in my neighborhood , and that i was half-cocked when i went there . <sssss> it was just ... more my speed . 
5		i must say , i will look for spring-hill suites wherever i go next time for good clean hotel at bargain price . <sssss> i was surprised at the condition of the room which was spacious with 2 queen size beds , sofa with living room area , 2 flat screen tvs , mini kitchen with microwave oven . <sssss> free breakfast -lrb- scrambled egg , canadian bacon , muffin , waffle , yogurt , very good for free breakfast -rrb- , free wifi -lrb- even though the speed is bit slow -rrb- . <sssss> with tax , one night 's stay came out to $ 85 . <sssss> excellent staff , friendly service and excellent location as it is close to many restaurants and shops . <sssss> 10 miles to phoenix , very nice area . <sssss> i would stay here again any time . 
5		great place - friendly staff , great live music , love the couscous & chicken . <sssss> i keep saying i 'm going to try something else but then i know i 'll miss this tasty dish . <sssss> best to order it & share w someone who orders a pizza . <sssss> such a gem . <sssss> love it ! 
5		there hummus is to die for !! <sssss> yum : -rrb- 
5		oh cowtown boots , i love you . <sssss> you get five stars . <sssss> you get five stars for no other reason than that you had my red boots , the red boots i could n't find anywhere around san francisco -lrb- duh , self , did you really think you 'd find an extensive selection of cowboy boots in san francisco ?? -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> you get five stars because i could n't even get those boots through the manufacturer for like a year , no joke . <sssss> backordered . <sssss> you get five stars because you had two pairs . <sssss> `` do you have them in a 6 1/2 ? '' <sssss> `` um ... yeah two pairs . '' <sssss> oh that 's ... wait what ? <sssss> two pairs ! <sssss> vs. a year ! <sssss> two pairs wins ! <sssss> f * ck yeah !! <sssss> you get five stars because you are a boot warehouse ... a boot country ... maybe even a boot continent . <sssss> you made me want to be a cowgirl . <sssss> you made me want to be a redneck . <sssss> you made me want more boots -lrb- but not your gross cowboy clothes -rrb- . <sssss> i 'm probably like , the youngest , least conservative person to ever shop there , but you had my red boots . <sssss> and now iiiii have them . <sssss> and i am so pleased . <sssss> and for that you get five stars . 
5		omg !!! <sssss> when i heard about this place i had to try it ! <sssss> i was so excited and it is in a great location right in the heart of old town scottsdale ... i sampled different flavors ... i tried the jack daniels chocolate ... the one with southern comfort ... i tried the chocolate beer flavor and after just trying those i was hooked ! <sssss> omg omg omg !!! <sssss> this place is heaven on earth for adults ... they have non-alcoholic flavors too ! <sssss> it has just enough of the liqueur flavor without tasting overwhelming ... but at the same time you can taste it and you know its in there ... the place is decorated to cute ... i love the pink and brown and the mirrors on the walls ... its perfect ! <sssss> the owner was the one that was there and she was so sweet and patient because i did not know what i wanted ! <sssss> i asked her about how she thought about the concept of this place and she said she would always make ice cream for friends and she would infuse it with alcohol and then she decided to open up this place ! <sssss> she did a very smart thing ! <sssss> i want to order some for myself at home ! <sssss> remember when you go you can combine the flavors and have half one flavor and the other half another ! <sssss> that is what i did ! <sssss> delicious !!! 
5		i love coming here . <sssss> the staff is knowledgeable . <sssss> stewart was amazing and knowledge about the power bars and other items in the health section of the store . <sssss> the meat department will let you taste the meats before buying . <sssss> bakery is awesome at explaining flavors and making cakes look awesome ! <sssss> this place might be pennies more then winco but the service is well worth more then a few pennies . <sssss> love this place . <sssss> it 's also 24 hours and allow dogs in . <sssss> as long as their in carts during the summer . <sssss> which is a huge plus !

5		this is one of my favorite music venues in the valley . <sssss> it 's an outdoor grass venue that is big enough to get good bands but small enough to feel intimate . <sssss> it 's all open so you can get right up there next to the stage . <sssss> i saw modest mouse here last year and am looking forward to seeing death cab for cutie this december . <sssss> keep your eye on the concert schedule . 
5		you could drive past here several times & still miss it . <sssss> tucked away , little sign . <sssss> but , when you do walk in , be prepared to find your favorite wine at way less than you 've purchased it previously . <sssss> this is especially true if it is a high end wine or if you special order by the case . <sssss> tom , the owner , will be happy to try to accomodate most any wine request . <sssss> i think if he ca n't get it , no one can lol . <sssss> so do n't be shy , ask ! 
5		it is always a pleasure to dine at the vu ! <sssss> this location is the best view in the state ! <sssss> the great food , service , live music and atmosphere make this restaurant one of the best around . <sssss> a great place to enjoy dinner or just a glass of wine . <sssss> i highly recommend the vu ! 
5		still the best vietnamese food in town . <sssss> for that matter , the best asian comfort food . <sssss> always a good meal . <sssss> my wife and i had n't been in almost six months -lrb- stupid diets -rrb- took a friend from out of town last night , and it was amazing ... just like we remembered it . <sssss> john -lrb- the owners son -rrb- and his wife ha , remembered us , and asked us where we had been ! <sssss> love this place . <sssss> this is a must try restaurant ! 
5		we just got back from having our honeymoon week at this resort . <sssss> simply amazing ! <sssss> relaxing by the pool in the casitas was very relaxing . <sssss> the attendants at the pool were very helpful with the pitchers of chilled water with fruit slices and the free snacks of chilled fruit , fruit smoothies and dibs ice cream were awesome . <sssss> the first night we arrived we had dinner in the outside area by the onyx bar . <sssss> the food was great and the views at night of pinnacle peak and the city lights of scottsdale far beyond were awesome ! <sssss> the staff was so friendly and helpful . <sssss> anything you asked for , they delivered . <sssss> we told the front desk at check-in that we had just gotten married and when we had dinner the first night the server brought us an amazing dessert that had `` congratulations '' written in chocolate on the dish ... on the house . <sssss> while we were at the pool , the attendants brought us champagne in honor of our honeymoon . <sssss> we came back to our room on the second day to find a bottle of champagne and strawberries with ganache as well . <sssss> we are already making plans to return again next year ! 
5		burrito bowl ! <sssss> yummy !!!! 
5		best eggs and biscuits i 've had . <sssss> definitely worth the trip . 
5		this review is just for the golf course . <sssss> looks like some people have already reviewed the course under resort listing , so i 'll just put it here . <sssss> i just love playing at the legacy . <sssss> something about the place leads to a great day for me and my friends every time we 're out there . <sssss> as other reviewers mentioned , the course is in great shape year round . <sssss> the course itself is fun , no gimmicky stuff , but still has lots of character . <sssss> very playable , but the bunkers can really get to you . <sssss> the practice facility is one of the better ones in town , too . <sssss> overall , it 's a great golf facility . <sssss> good staff , good f&b , great course , and very good practice area . <sssss> the rates get high in season , but good deals can still be found via golfnow.com . <sssss> i 've scored some $ 40-50 rates in peak season as a twosome . <sssss> summer rates go for about $ 30 on golfnow . <sssss> some may not see the legacy as a 5-star facility , and that 's understandable , but it 's consistently a great time out there and i feel it deserves it . 
5		the bruschetta here rocks ! <sssss> hands down . <sssss> . <sssss> ive never had anything like it . <sssss> . <sssss> all of the bruschettas are great . <sssss> . <sssss> my least fav is the tuscan bean . <sssss> . <sssss> im just not a fan . <sssss> . <sssss> the fig & mascarpone is more of a ` dessert ' than a app ... :--rrb- i havent had a bad wine there yet , either . <sssss> postino is always trendy and fun ... great date place ... :--rrb- always crowded ... 
5		you know i 'm an avid hiker - so when i was in az for the weekend - the opportunity to hike on saturday morning was amazing - all hungover as can be as well ! <sssss> bad choice ! <sssss> so my friends and i decided to go hiking . <sssss> . <sssss> yippee ! <sssss> super excited ... i did n't know i was going on the trek of a lifetime ! <sssss> holy cow - echo canyon - this was an amazing and challenging hike ! <sssss> you should first of all come really early - unlike most people we did n't arrive early and waited to find parking for about 45 mins ... but well worth it this hike is not for the faint of heart - sure there 's fencing - probably too many accidents - i would n't doubt it because when i was there the fire trucks and ambulance came great 360 views at the top , rock climbing more than hiking there ! <sssss> i luved it - next time i think i will go again with the proper gear ! 
5		love the fast service when too lazy to cook . <sssss> the food is great . 
5		i have been going to chino 's for 15 + years , i do n't remember when i started there . <sssss> a good friend ran a paperback book store just south and chino 's was a regular stop for us for lunch or for dinner afterwards before spending an evening gaming or watching movies . <sssss> the 19th ave location has expanded twice since i started going there . <sssss> chino 's is an amazing place , and has been featured on food network 's diners , drive-ins , and dives . <sssss> the owners , eve and frank , are great people . <sssss> in fact , meeting eve for the first time was an interesting experience : she started staring at me and asked `` do you have a brother named rick ? '' <sssss> i replied yes . <sssss> `` did you go to sunnyslope ? '' <sssss> i replied yes . <sssss> i did n't think i looked that much like my brother that she could identify me through him . <sssss> it was amusing , unfortunately it 's been quite a while since i 've seen her and frank , i heard they 're mainly working in the chandler location . <sssss> chino 's is restaurant with an interesting structure . <sssss> if you 're new , walk up to the counter and tell them that you 're a newbie and they 'll give you samples of all of their meats . <sssss> you then choose to have your meat with a rice & beans bowl , or in a quesadilla or burrito , or you get a combo plate where you can get two meats , by themselves or in burritos or quesadillas with rice and beans . <sssss> the beans are refried or black , the rice can be white , fried , chicken fried , pork fried , or jerk fried . <sssss> it 's just great stuff . <sssss> myself , i prefer the jade red chicken and frequently get it in a burrito with black beans . <sssss> eve was very skeptical every time i ordered my burrito , then one day she made one for himself and decided it as pretty good . <sssss> one thing that 's been cool is their weekends . <sssss> on week days , you get a snickerdoodle cookie for dessert , on the weekends they have specialty cookies like a lovey chocolate bomb called a volcano cookie . <sssss> they also do butterscotch cookies , and probably one or two that i ca n't name . <sssss> the weekends also have on offer black bean tostadas , which are awesome . <sssss> and you can buy the cookies by the dozen to take for later consumption . <sssss> i would n't say that chino 's is infinite diversity in infinite combinations , but pretty darn close . <sssss> well worth the time , but expect long waits if you go there at dinner time friday or saturday . <sssss> lunches can also get slammed by engineers from honeywell -lrb- or whatever they 're called this week -rrb- , your best chances for fast service is in off-peak hours . <sssss> they also are frequently closed on holidays , so plan accordingly . <sssss> it can also be quite noisy when it 's full , so do n't be surprised . 
5		this restaurant find made our day . <sssss> we just walked in to this appealing looking restaurant and found the best of surprises . <sssss> from the beginning , the service could n't have been better , hostess , waiter , busboys . <sssss> then the food : kale salad , brussels sprout salad , smoked burrata , lamb pasta , and scallops . <sssss> the burrata was the only thing that seemed as if something was missing . <sssss> not much smoky flavor , and without that the cheese was just cheese . <sssss> but the other dishes were great , especially the scallops , not something i expected to find and enjoy so much in the middle of the desert . <sssss> overall , a great experience , great food and great service . <sssss> would recommend this place to everyone . 
5		truly great pizza , truly truly great . <sssss> the pork belly appetizer and the chicken are just ok , but the pizza is awesome . <sssss> i got goat cheese and speck , i have been here several times and would recomend the pizza to anybody . 
5		as far as asian buffets go , i think this place is as good as it gets . <sssss> it 's in an old claim jumper restaurant and except for the very large buffet stations , they 've left pretty much everything as is . <sssss> it 's comfortable seating and feels most upscale than most other buffet places . <sssss> the food is fresher ; it 's served on platters in smaller batches as opposed to dumping a huge pile of food into a stainless trough . <sssss> there is much more variety and the food is better quality ! <sssss> some of my favorites , the calamari - lightly breaded in a sweet sauce , the tempura - huge shrimps and veggies fried just right , the dishes with beef had nice cuts of meat , tender and not fatty/gristly , and the snow peas and green beans were slightly crispy and very tasty . <sssss> they also have a better than average selection of salads , sushi , fresh fruits and yummy desserts . <sssss> the custard was awesome and tasted just like creme brulee . <sssss> the service is also 5 stars , they were quick to remove our dirty plates and kept my iced tea and water filled without having to ask . <sssss> they also set extra napkins on the table and wet naps , without us having to ask ! <sssss> as rand h said , this is the wandering horse of asian buffets ! 
5		let me just say , jade red trifecta ! <sssss> that includes jade red chicken , jade red quisadilla , jade red burrito . <sssss> to answer your question , no i do not eat all of this . <sssss> i do know of a few people that do . <sssss> if you have n't tried this place you have to . <sssss> it definitely has some character . <sssss> put aside the bad decor and you have got a one of a kind restaurant . <sssss> hopefully you will be there on a volcano cookie day . <sssss> happy eating ! 
5		this is probably the best burger bar in az , possibly the west coast . <sssss> el diablo burger is out of this world , by far the best i 've had in years . <sssss> on their opening day it was really spicy , but has n't been that spicy since then . <sssss> either way , they will try to scare you , but really it 's not all that hot . <sssss> they picked such a great location and i suspect this place will continue to be as packed as it has been in the past few days since opening up . <sssss> i love the decor and ambiance they got going there . <sssss> the fries are great as well . <sssss> very fresh and not overly salty . <sssss> the only negative thing i have to say about this place is that they do n't have traditional simple desserts . <sssss> who has room for a shake after a burger ? <sssss> i never understood that trend . <sssss> also worth mentioning is the truly awesome customer service . <sssss> i do n't know if it 's because they just opened , but it seems like they have a lot of people working there . <sssss> which is great , they 're all nice and eager to help you out . <sssss> next i plan on trying other burger combinations as well as their grass-fed patties . 
5		i highly recommend nice nice dental office ! <sssss> if you want your teeth to sparkle go here ! <sssss> dr. cooke is amazing ! <sssss> you can tell he loves what he does and takes extra time and care with his patients ! <sssss> the staff there is so sweet and friendly ! <sssss> and by far the most gorgeous dental office i have ever been too !!! 
5		one of the best donuts i 've had in my life ! <sssss> apple fritter is to heavenly . <sssss> addicting ... check . <sssss> fatening ... check . <sssss> is n't part of my neanderthal diet ... check . 
5		wow ... just ... wow . <sssss> there are some angry people on here ! <sssss> i originally came here looking for mr. troncellito 's phone number to provide my mother to refer her to his office . <sssss> i dealth with him in early 2011 and i was originally referred to him by a friend . <sssss> i can honestly say i did not have any issues with mike or any member in his office . <sssss> he took my small claims case , was very friendly , charismatic , not aggressive , quick-witted , did not use any off-beat analogies -lrb- i mean , who really enjoys sour milk ? -rrb- <sssss> , and did a great job overall . <sssss> also , his office was very clean , nicely set up , and his staff members are efficient -- they get the job done . <sssss> if you have any questions or want proof that he helped me out with a case in time of need -lrb- i.e. this is not spam -rrb- , feel free to message me directly . 
5		best bagel and breakfast sandwich i have had in phoenix area . <sssss> scrumptous . 
5		i love the staff at this store . <sssss> they are the reason i keep coming back . <sssss> this store is usually very busy - however the employees take the time to talk to you , get to know what 's going on and really build a relationship with their customers . <sssss> any starbucks can make you a drink - this starbucks is more about the experience . 
5		wonderful sushi , top notch . <sssss> the octopus came with a sweet sauce that complimented the octopus very well . <sssss> service was prompt , the server pleasant . <sssss> did n't have any alcoholic drinks , so ca n't attest to the bartender 's skills . <sssss> would recommend this place to anyone . 
5		i have nothing but great things to say about this place ! <sssss> i have been to both locations in the valley -lrb- biltmore and the scottsdale quarter -rrb- and not only is the food mouth watering . <sssss> . <sssss> the atmosphere is so great ! <sssss> i ca n't wait to go back again ! 
5		going to laser 4 less was one of the best decisions i made ! <sssss> i used to shave every day but now after my laser treatments i do n't remember last time i had to shave . <sssss> it truly works !!! <sssss> the staff is super friendly and professional . <sssss> the technicians will give you the best advice before you start with sessions . <sssss> i love laser for less , it is amazingggg !!! 
5		i feel like a broken record , but just when i thought the international supper club uye 's could not get any better ... boom , the first isc uye of 2014 turns out to be the funnest event yet ! <sssss> yelper shout-outs : whoopie kate k and drew c made it to their first isc uye ! <sssss> how cool is that . <sssss> i hope that we did n't scare them off !!! <sssss> these yelpers get their own paragraph : the best part of the night was the fact that marisa and joe s brought 5 bottles of wine from their oregon wine club/collection . <sssss> i am pretty sure it is why i really got to see joe 's personality come out !!! <sssss> whoot whoot ... thank you everyone for attending . <sssss> thank you villa peru for having us and serving everything so quickly and promptly ! <sssss> i think villa peru did an excellent job in their small restaurant catering to 18 + people . <sssss> all of our food came out quickly and we were all able to eat at the same time ! <sssss> awesome for a small restaurant . <sssss> i have been to villa peru before with my lunch club http://www.yelp.com/biz/villa-peru-peruvian-restaurant-tempe#hrid:cetxhmslxcwohjft3nmj5a . <sssss> so , when i knew we were coming here , i decided , i would not order the same thing i had the last time . <sssss> what do i do when i get there ? <sssss> i ordered the exact same thing ! <sssss> wth ! <sssss> really ? <sssss> i should have read my yelp review . <sssss> i had the most delicious shrimp soup -lrb- chupa de camorones -rrb- . <sssss> the flavor was amazing last night . <sssss> the soup is chock full of veggies , rice and these medium poached eggs . <sssss> the shrimp is not as plentiful as i would have liked , but where it lacked in shrimp it made up for in a flavor explosion in my mouth . <sssss> becca h sat next to me and i kept staring at her lamb ... she clearly enjoyed it becuase she ate all of her lamb . <sssss> i may go back there to try that lamb , it smelled and looked amazing . <sssss> ca n't wait for next month 's event . <sssss> until then , syoy #iscuye #yelpphx 
5		cool bar with no signs . <sssss> dark lounge feel with great music . 
5		we had our condo 's carpet done in november , and we are still getting compliments on it . <sssss> i was ready to pull it up and start over , now i believe we can wait at least three more years . <sssss> they did an amazing job . <sssss> i will be using them at least once a year from now on ! 
5		okay , i 'm not sure about anything else on the menu yet , but the chinese chicken salad is something else !!!!!!! <sssss> it 's a little expensive for a salad , but its huge and well worth it . <sssss> make sure you ask for an extra salad dressing . <sssss> there 's so much salad that you may need it ! 
5		great pizza and awesome wings ! <sssss> the staff is friendly and funny . <sssss> the food is always good and very reasonable . <sssss> even during the busy days/nights , you never have to wait for very long . <sssss> they also have good deals on pizza and wings . 
5		great gelato !! <sssss> if you do not know anything about gelato you need to check this place out !! <sssss> it is some of the best gelato / ice cream / frozen yogurt i have had in a long time ! <sssss> if you go on the weekend night you are going to have to wait in line ! <sssss> last time i went it the line was out the door ! <sssss> we waited for 15 minutes , well worth the wait ! <sssss> do not be turned off by the line ! <sssss> you will be happy you waited ! 
5		lovely little restaurant , terrific food . <sssss> i had the soup/salad combo with chipotle chocolate soup and the sunflower salad . <sssss> the soup was divine , with a blissful mini corn-muffin as garnish . <sssss> the salad was pretty and just the right size . <sssss> i splurged and got dessert , caramelized bananas over rice pudding which had luscious burnt-sugar bits floating in a buttery , sugary sauce poured over a not-overly-sweet rice pudding . <sssss> mmmmmmmmmmm . 
5		very fast , super helpful looking for a juice that helps with detoxing after drinking . <sssss> plus the juice taste great ! <sssss> i am a regular juice drinker and i would rank this one higher than most . <sssss> plus it is connected to true food a great restaurant with a great concept ! 
5		the tonkatsu i have been searching for . <sssss> so good it seriously brought a tear to my eye . <sssss> such friendly service as well . 
5		for a fast food burger , this place is tops ! <sssss> far superior to in 'n' out , which seems to be what a lot of people choose to compare it with . <sssss> i guess it 's like the whole coke vs. pepsi thing , except with burgers . <sssss> and my choice is obvious . <sssss> tons of choices for toppings and condiments , fries are crinkle-style and tasty , and the selection of deserts is almost too much ! <sssss> fresh food , friendly service , clean dining room and restrooms . <sssss> food takes a little longer than say , mcdonald 's , but it 's well worth the extra minute . <sssss> give it a try , i think you 'll be impressed . 
5		my fiance and i are all about our chicken wings , and atl is as good as it gets . <sssss> the honey habanero and garlic parmesan are our top picks . <sssss> the spicy tator tots are a must have . <sssss> they 're some magical combination of tator tots and jalapeno poppers that i have to order every single time ! <sssss> also , bonus points for carrying cans of cactus cooler . 
5		stopped in here after reading previous reviews on yelp . <sssss> you guys did n't lie ! <sssss> this is a great little place . <sssss> we were nicely surprised to find they had dine-in seating . <sssss> everything was clean & neat , despite the fact that it was the lunch hour . <sssss> our waitress was quick , efficient , & friendly . <sssss> we had crab puffs which were small but so tasty that size did n't matter . <sssss> i had kung pao chicken which was delicious , diced into just the right size bites & had a lot of peanuts . <sssss> the sauce was spicy but not overwheming or too much . <sssss> my son had szechuan beef which he devoured , declaring it the best he 's eaten for a long time . <sssss> our tea glasses were never empty , even on a 105 day . <sssss> and all the food came out of the kitchen with steam rolling off it . <sssss> prices were very reasonable . <sssss> we will def be back ! <sssss> you ca n't beat this for a quick neighborhood-ish bite or take out ! 
5		is this narnia ? <sssss> . <sssss> . <sssss> no ? <sssss> oh just an antique wonderland ! <sssss> this place is huge . <sssss> i love antique malls so much , although a lot are quite disorganized and you could come across a lot of overpriced `` junk '' - like who collects unopened cans of pepsi from 1984 ? <sssss> this antique mall has those things , but is really organized and nice . <sssss> it 's one of the only malls that i 've seen a great vintage clothing selection in . <sssss> there 's only a few sections -lrb- towards the front , left end of the mall -rrb- , but a lot of the clothing is from the 50s-70s and is in great shape . <sssss> there 's also great vendors for jewelry and kitchenware-totally unrelated things , but that 's kind of what i 'm into . <sssss> i could spend hours in this place . <sssss> i highly recommend to anyone who 's a lover of antiques and treasure hunting , just make sure you have enough time to look through the place . 
5		i love manuel 's !! <sssss> my family and i have been coming here for years . <sssss> i 've now turned my boyfriend onto them too ! <sssss> we always go on a monday or tuesday when they have the beef taco and cheese enchilada on special for $ 6.99 and the house margaritas are only $ 4.00 . <sssss> the food is consistently good and so is the service . 
5		this place is great ! <sssss> i had the uptown salad and it was almost as big ad the tray it came on . <sssss> we hit the place on a saturday at 11 am and we were the only ones there . <sssss> the gal behind the counter treated us like royalty . <sssss> 5 of us ate for around $ 45 , drinks included . <sssss> the food was tasty and fresh and i really could n't ask for better service . <sssss> the music they were playing was a mix of modern alternative and retro classic rock -lrb- late 80s -rrb- . <sssss> the place is clean and open and homey . <sssss> i would definitely come back here when i 'm downtown . <sssss> beats the bars and overpriced bistros anytime . 
5		one of the best restaurants i 've had the luxury of dining at in decades . <sssss> i could n't in good consciousness deny my worst enemy the opportunity to eat at such a wondrous venue . <sssss> the short ribs were melt-in-your-mouth finger-licking fantastic . <sssss> the signature cocktails are so fanciful they almost command you to lift your pinky as you daintifully sip your way into alcoholic bliss . <sssss> the oversized/giant lamps at every turn make you feel as if you are walking in a land of giants or that you have found yourself in a ` honey i shrunk the kids ' situation . <sssss> the cherry on top would have to be the free chocolate chip cookies upon your departure . <sssss> they soothe the restless ` fat kid ' inside of us all and make the terrible act of leaving cheslea 's kitchen a bit more bearable 
5		i do n't know how a pizza place that that been on tv stayed such a west-side secret but this place has and it 's amazing . <sssss> i love not having to wait long for easily the best pizza in the valley . <sssss> the wood fire grill helps create what can only be described as the best crust ever ! <sssss> i will back up some of the other statements that the pizza can be somewhat inconsistent and it appears they are really at their best when the owner is cooking . <sssss> but even the `` bad '' pizzas are still better then most anything else you 've had in the valley so there is n't much room to complain . <sssss> also , one of the few places you can still get bottle coke with real sugar . <sssss> i 'm not sure if it 's much different then normal coke , but some people go crazy for that so i thought i would throw that in too . <sssss> have fun and enjoy ! 
5		i love this place ! <sssss> good food and even better service ! 
5		rocket burger offers a variety of choices that you probably wo n't find at larger food chains . <sssss> :p pretty much everything there is delicious . <sssss> and , and , aaaand -lrb- look how excited i am -rrb- they have a huge selection of bottled sodas . <sssss> seriously . <sssss> there 's just a wall of carbonated , fizzy , goodness ~ . 
5		dropped in here one morning to get a latte and a sparkly blueberry muffin at about 8am on a week day and it was dead . <sssss> but i bet this place is happenin ' at night on the weekends . <sssss> there are a ton of seats , checkers games , books , magazines , comfy chairs ... and it 's huge so there 's plenty of room so you are n't in someone else 's space when you just want to friggen write a report . <sssss> i got the toasted marshmallow latte ... yummy . <sssss> i kinda wanted it to be a little creamier , but it was still tasty . <sssss> i also had a sparkly blueberry muffin . <sssss> they get their muffins from someplace in tempe who puts sparkles on their baked goods ... and it really was good . 
5		this is a place that the food is exquisite and the workers are very friendly . <sssss> simple restaurant but the taste millionaire :-rrb- i love it 
5		as a former us airways passenger , i have to tell you . <sssss> there is no comparison . <sssss> southwest out classes them hands down !! <sssss> they have employees who actually smile , talk to customers , shake their hands . <sssss> they even give you a snack with the complimentary beverages . <sssss> for about $ 100 less for my short flight , i will take less attitude , better service , and a crew who actually likes to get along act as one company not two that merged several years ago and their employees still have not gotten over it . <sssss> i have taken the phoenix to san diego route several times . <sssss> on us airways , they stop service to passengers at the slightest turbulence . <sssss> would not be so bad if it was truly an emergency but you know it is pure laziness when us airways cuts service and then they all stand around talking . <sssss> kudos to crystal on flight 1011 san diego to phoenix 625pm on 4/4/2013 for being so nice ! <sssss> i really think before any merger takes effect , us airways should send their employees to southwest so they can learn how to treat their passengers and each other . <sssss> btw , you may hear stories about passengers getting out of hand sometime on southwest but they are so much better than us airways passengers . <sssss> very polite , they wait their turn , and they are not rude and demanding . <sssss> although some of that may stem from us air 's employees and trickle down do not let anyone fool you ! <sssss> southwest is a great price airline with great employees and passengers . <sssss> so do not pay more to be ghetto . <sssss> get onboard with southwest and outclass those who think they are better ! 
5		every bite of every tapas here are just pure bliss ! <sssss> yellowtail and grapefruit , pork belly buns , oyster uni , japanese pancakes ... how can you not be salivating right now ? <sssss> i am looking forward to trying the other tapas dishes . <sssss> i may just have to push back visits to sens. 
5		feels like home ! <sssss> very welcoming and relaxed . <sssss> great worship and biblical teaching . <sssss> also serve donuts and coffee between services to create a relaxed environment and a bbq at noon ! 
5		ahh ! <sssss> i went here one day and took a whole 2 hours to go back again ! <sssss> this place was great ! <sssss> i found curtains for my house for a whopping 12 bucks !! <sssss> -lrb- for both panels -rrb- and books , games , the whole shebang ! <sssss> yeah , i agree with jessica on wanting to save this little secret of mine . <sssss> . <sssss> but man oh man ! <sssss> i spent so many hours at antique stores and totally neglected the real deal ! <sssss> definitely recommended . <sssss> . <sssss> or not recommended ... if you 're going for any size 6s ! 
5		amazing eccentric dishes with gluten free , vegetarian , options ! <sssss> price is right and will certainly be back . <sssss> we were in town for one night , found this restaurant on yelp with my family of 7 , and walked out extremely satisfied . <sssss> will recommend to anyone in phoenix !!! 
5		we got wonderful service here after being totally turned down at the verizon company store at tempe market place . <sssss> our salesman michael was very helpfuland went out ofhis way to help us save money and work us through a complicated purchase.we have bought phones fromthis location and have always had a great , personal experience . <sssss> the phones were also cheaper than the quotes we got at the company stores . <sssss> michael also was more than willing to discount tradtional high dollar add-ons . <sssss> great experience all around . 
5		ah , the go-to place for day drinking and ditching classes with my classmates in medical school . <sssss> future doctors of america , right here , baby ! <sssss> the menu offers standard americanized mexican food fare , but there 's just enough variety to have something for everyone . <sssss> on the days i thought it inappropriate to return to class smelling of beer , i would turn to the horchata -- fresh and delicious , every time . <sssss> like fricking clockwork . <sssss> the food is fresh and , magically , not heavy . <sssss> the salsa bar lets you dump on as much diarrheaogenic hot sauce as your asshole can tolerate , and the chips must be made fresh because nothing that good comes out of a bag . <sssss> regretfully , i am virtually never in the northwest valley anymore , and have enjoyed the caramba experience maybe once since graduation . <sssss> this is tragic . <sssss> why ca n't caramba force mi patio out and set up shop there ? 
5		i absolutely love fry 's marketplace ! <sssss> it has everything you could ever want from a grocery store . <sssss> i enjoy the deli station where i can place an order for all of my deli meats and cheese i need . <sssss> it is ready in 15 mins and sometimes is even quicker . <sssss> i shop for my produce and by the time i get to the deli my order is waiting for me . <sssss> another amazing quality about fry 's market place is their bakery . <sssss> it is amazing . <sssss> they can pretty much make you anything you need . <sssss> i have worked with kathy the baker on many occasions . <sssss> kathy is always very nice , helpful and so creative . <sssss> i have order about 10 delicious cakes from her over the past 8 months . <sssss> we just keep coming back ! <sssss> i can find everything at this store and everyone is so friendly . <sssss> also , i have the fry 's app and i am able to download digital coupons straight to my card , track my gas points and make grocery lists . <sssss> check out is always quick and easy . <sssss> i highly recommend shopping here ! 
5		my husband and i stumbled upon this place while looking for a place to eat one evening . <sssss> i 'm more adventurous than he is about food , but even he was thrilled with the food and the service . <sssss> a couple of times , we have been served by the owner who is wonderfully hospitable and charming . <sssss> my husband consistently orders the daily special and has never once been disappointed . <sssss> i usually order the gyro , which is truly the best gyro i have ever had . <sssss> i just ca n't help myself - i crave it now . <sssss> we have been back half a dozen times already and i was also inspired to try their other location when i was in the neighborhood recently . <sssss> so thankful to have something that is not a chain restaurant to chose from in the area . <sssss> we 'll be back many times . 
5		best sushi in the valley ! <sssss> do n't let the hole-in-the-wall facade fool you . <sssss> this place is a class act . <sssss> friendly and speedy service , all-day happy hour , fresh , authentic , inexpensive , and delicious . <sssss> will now be my go-to for sushi . 
5		i like this store a lot ! <sssss> it has a good selection of dvds and music in stock and if it 's not in , it generally can be special ordered . <sssss> rather interesting shirts can be had there it seems . <sssss> the incense smells wonderful , i might add . <sssss> the staff is the other bonus . <sssss> i do n't recall ever having bad service there . <sssss> the staff is usually rather nice . <sssss> my last visit was over the top with first rate customer service and fun conversations . <sssss> before a few days ago it would have gotten a 4 star rating but my last experience was so good , i felt the need to add that 5th star . 
5		i 've been coming here since i was in college at asu 15 years ago . <sssss> i now live in surprise and make the hour drive just to eat here about twice a month . <sssss> best deli ever ! <sssss> friendly staff , casual atmosphere and amazing food . <sssss> my favorite is the dilly bird on rye with cheese soup . <sssss> eat here , you wo n't be disappointed : -rrb- 
5		bought a google offer this past weekend , $ 20 for $ 40 worth of food . <sssss> stopped to pick up lunch for me and a friend and wow , $ 40 went far ! <sssss> and it was good !!! <sssss> we had sushi , rolls , tempura veggies , and the monkey brains . <sssss> way too much food for two of us and it was all out of this world . <sssss> i 'm a huge sushi fan and the fish was sliced perfectly and so so fresh - like butter ! <sssss> the rolls were great too , not too much rice and a perfect bite size . <sssss> we will definitely be back ! 
5		i am so sick and tired of writing sub par reviews , i totally forgot i have n't yelped von hanson 's yet . <sssss> i 've been here three times . <sssss> i am proud to say i live so close to it . <sssss> the meat here is amazing . <sssss> the butchers are friendlier than disney world employees . <sssss> so far i 've had the ribeye 's twice and filet 's once . <sssss> what 's great about this place is they do n't pre cut a bunch of filets and sell them . <sssss> they ask how big you want it and go in the back and cut it . <sssss> the sausage selection is out of this world but i have n't had the time to make them . <sssss> they come frozen . <sssss> i 've tried the bacon wrapped jalapenos stuffed with cream cheese and i was impressed . <sssss> what was strange about them was out of the 6 i bought , 1 ended up being one of the hottest things i have ever eaten . <sssss> in fact , i had to wait about 20 minutes before i could eat my dinner in order to enjoy it . <sssss> if you love cooking meat and have some extra money to spend , come out to von 's . <sssss> it 's amazing . 
5		at one yoga took my level of practice up a notch . <sssss> the number of classes a week and the times makes it easy for anyone to work into their weekly schedule . <sssss> the different types of classes gets me in the door no matter how i feel that day . <sssss> if i 'm tired , the basic class is perfect or if i feel like i am wanting to challenge myself with a new pose , the power or astanga class makes me feel like i have accomplished a pratice . <sssss> i also see quick results with the workout . <sssss> the teachers are fantasic and are willing to help you with poses . <sssss> i love it there ! 
5		beyond obsessed with the chocolate chip scone here ! <sssss> when i am craving a sweet treat , this is what i want/need ! <sssss> i love to meet friends here and sit outside . <sssss> my favorite meal is a cup of potato cream cheese soup and the blt plus -lrb- i sub cucumber instead of the tomato , ask them to leave the mayo off and sub brie for the cheddar -rrb- . <sssss> it is perfection ! <sssss> my son ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes with the blueberries and a side of bacon and he was completely raving about his meal . <sssss> that 's saying a lot ! <sssss> service is friendly and helpful , the restaurant is always inviting and clean and we always leave with a few shortbread cookies `` for later '' . <sssss> i will be back to try the chopped salad with salmon ~ it seems that every person around us was enjoying one last time we were there . 
5		this was a great dinning experience food was fab . <sssss> great service . <sssss> cooks wore gloves friendly staff . <sssss> . <sssss> manager was the nicest man . <sssss> . <sssss> we will be back . 
5		i am sorry unphogettable . <sssss> i am sorry it took me so long to get here . <sssss> i was told by many about your greatness , but i still took the longer route . <sssss> at least i got here and now i am here to stay . <sssss> your service is awesome . <sssss> our waitress , who i think owns the place , was so helpful . <sssss> the food was delicious . <sssss> i had an amazing thai tea that was not too sweet , which they usually tend to be . <sssss> the vermicelli chicken noodles tasted great . <sssss> even the dessert of fruit and coconut was great . <sssss> i had a wonderful time and will be coming back soon ! 
5		we love this place and ca n't get enough of it . <sssss> this is right across from chandler high school along az avenue , and during lunch times the line is out the door . <sssss> i like enchilada-style burritos . <sssss> they are so yummy , and the drink cups are totally huge . <sssss> i just wish their hot sauces were better . 
5		for me nothing beats a great hot dog and that what ted 's is all about . <sssss> the charbroiled dogs there are the best in town and keep me coming back over and over . <sssss> the onion rings also will knock your socks off if you 're into fried tasty goodness . <sssss> the burgers are legit too , but get a dog and you 'll never forget it . 
5		this is the first review i have taken the time to write but wanted to after what i felt was above and beyond customer service provided to me by tom and oxford cleaners . <sssss> this location i have used for three years since moving to the south chandler area . <sssss> recently i had taken a really nice dress shirt to oxford . <sssss> upon getting the shirt back i noticed one of the metal buttons was damaged and pushed in . <sssss> i brought this up to tom and asked if there was anything that could be done to salvage the shirt . <sssss> under my own admission i had not asked for the shirt to be handled the proper way . <sssss> tom took the shirt and told me he would have his people take care of it and instructed me on how shirts like these need be sent in moving forward . <sssss> upon receiving the shirt back , not only was the button repaired , but he took extra steps to clean the shirt and remove some dry cleaning soil to the point where the shirt looked like when i originally purchased . <sssss> i so appreciate the level of customer service provided and felt like a valued customer . <sssss> there was no liability to correct what could have been perceived as my error and them doing what i asked them to do . <sssss> i would recommend this business to anybody . 
5		update : i was back in the area again today -lrb- on my way to pick a friend up from the airport -rrb- so i stopped in and i was pleased to find out that nothing has changed . <sssss> still great food and service , and low prices . <sssss> they even remembered who i was and asked how i 've been , despite the fact that i have n't been a customer in over a year -lrb- i moved out of state , then back , and now i 'm working across town -rrb- . <sssss> i still highly recommend this place ! 
5		wifey and i have been dining here for 4 years now , and we really like it . <sssss> its too spicy for some , and we have tried nearly everything on their menu , with only one or two disappointments . <sssss> price is right , the salsa and chips are great , decor is funky and colorful , service is just ok sometimes . <sssss> best stuff on the menu - white sands chimichanga is great ! <sssss> the fundido cheese appetizer is fantastic as well . <sssss> chili colorado is spicy and one of my favorites , as well as the grande nachos . <sssss> breakfast on weekends only is a killer bargain , and the new mexican eggs benedict is a winner ! <sssss> very , very cheap as well . <sssss> i am not sure why this place has received such mediocre reviews , as its not generic & boring mexican food such as macayo 's , garduno 's , manuel 's , or garcias ! 
5		always a first class experience when you come to souvia tea . <sssss> the owners are as welcoming as the the tea is delicious . <sssss> great atmosphere . <sssss> this award winning business has a great story . <sssss> really enjoyed my experience here . 
5		tried this place for the first time tonight , and was impressed with absolutely everything . <sssss> well-lit building in a decent location in the arcadia area . <sssss> i drove here from the garfield neighborhood and it was well worth it . <sssss> juicy chicken and awesome cafeteria throwback crinkle fries , along with one of the best slices of toast i 've ever had . <sssss> all three of these foods were still crispy when i got home , which almost never happens with fast food . <sssss> i wish i had gotten the girl 's name who took care of me . <sssss> she was cute as a button - very enthusiastic and happy to answer my questions . <sssss> i 'll be back here soon ! 
5		i met a buddy here for dinner last night . <sssss> here is the lowdown : location : 5/5 food : 5/5 service : 5/5 do n't miss the cornbread , it 's fantastic . <sssss> we started out by splitting a bowl of chips and salsa . <sssss> the salsa is fresh and very good . <sssss> the chips were crunchy and not too salty . <sssss> i had the green chili enchilada with black beans . <sssss> not normally a big black bean fan i was surprised how good these can taste when they are very fresh and well prepared . <sssss> the rice was nice and fluffy and delicious . <sssss> the waiter was cheerful and helpful with suggestions . <sssss> the service was very prompt without hovering over us - not an easy balance to strike . <sssss> a nice bonus is that they will valet your car for free . <sssss> just get your ticket validated by your server . <sssss> the location is right off mill ave. so you are right in the heart of the action . <sssss> the prices are very reasonable as well . <sssss> most of the entrees are $ 10-15 . <sssss> this place is great , give it a try . 
5		i hate that i love this store . <sssss> every time i come to the mall i like to check out what they 've got . <sssss> i usually end up leaving with at least a few pieces because they always have new stuff . <sssss> the tall sales guy is pretty chill and honest about how the clothes look on me . <sssss> he 's never sold me anything i was `` iffy '' about . <sssss> seems pretty low pressure when selling me their crap and he turned me on to the arc jeans which are nothing less than sickening on me ! <sssss> overall im totally satisfied with all my purchases from this place . 
5		it is seriously all about the diet lemonade . <sssss> i have purchased gallons for my house , it is that addicting and delicious ! <sssss> at first the cashiers would give me strange looks , but now they accept and embrace me ! 
5		took my two miniature schnauzers here and i have nothing but good thing to say ! <sssss> my dogs get a full shave -lrb- no schnauzer cut -rrb- but do get keep their beards and eyebrows . <sssss> after a simple explanation , i felt in good hands . <sssss> and when i came to pick them up , their trim was exactly what i wanted . <sssss> the ladies here do a great job and i ca n't wait until my dogs next trim ! 
5		great staff , beautiful room and nice & quiet . <sssss> good breakfast . <sssss> not far from pir . 
5		love the way my skin feels after visiting with lorna . <sssss> she uses many techniques and customizes your facial . <sssss> her prices are also great ! 
5		great food and friendly service . <sssss> i ordered the chicken pita w tzatziki and greek fries and it was sooo good !! <sssss> the greek fries came in a large bowl and could have fed the family . <sssss> the herbs on the fries were delicious ! <sssss> we were there on mother 's day and the owner , i believe , have the mom 's a complimentary piece of baklava which my daughter devoured . 
5		cool coffee shop . <sssss> great food . <sssss> live music was great . 
5		my wife and i found four peaks by chance . <sssss> we got lucky . <sssss> the food was great , service was great , and all thr beers rocked . <sssss> my wife 's fav was the heff and the arizona peach . <sssss> we got a beer glass to remember the occasion and plan to swing by on the way out and grab a growler . 
5		being new to phoenix , i wanted to check out the downtown cityscape area . <sssss> after looking at menus of the restaurants nearby , this one was the only one that looked delicious and fairly inexpensive so i made a reservation on the patio on a saturday night to go with friends . <sssss> we had an awesome experience . <sssss> our friends were late so my fiancée and i ordered a few drinks and waited at our table . <sssss> the waiter was super cool and did n't seem to mind at all that our friends were 20 mins late . <sssss> he gave us food recommendations and was everything a great waiter should be ! <sssss> needless to say , service was excellent ! <sssss> and the food ! <sssss> since we were sitting on the patio , we could order off the patio menu ... everything $ 6 ! <sssss> between the all of of us we got an order of nachos , chicken tacos , and several bbq pork quesadillas . <sssss> everyone loved the food . <sssss> especially for the price ! <sssss> i am a super fan of nachos with melted cheese and that can be surprisingly hard to come by , but these nachos had it . <sssss> sooo good . <sssss> they even brought us out a complimentary dessert . <sssss> . <sssss> key lime pie . <sssss> yum ! <sssss> i definitely would recommend fuego to anyone looking to grab dinner down in cityscape . <sssss> oh and they are dog friendly on the patio ! <sssss> i always love that ! 
5		lil moes is a whole new league of mechanic shops . <sssss> paul and paul got our 1985 winnebago back on the road so we could make it back home after traveling around the country in it . <sssss> they are incredibly knowledgeable , honest , and hilarious . <sssss> they thoroughly check possible causes of whatever problems you are experiencing and logically think through issues before diagnosing problems . <sssss> they work quickly and efficiently and take pride in the quality of the work that they do . <sssss> we have been to a lot of repair shops around the us and can say without a doubt this father/son duo is truly the best out there ! 
5		everything about this restaurant is great . <sssss> scottsdale vibe without all the attitude . <sssss> good wine and great food at reasonable prices . 
5		i have n't been to a soda shop like this since i was a kid in the 1970 's . <sssss> the atmosphere is a throw-back to the 1930 's or 40 's , and it was , indeed , a great pleasure to sit in the ambiance , view all the eclectic antiques/nostalgia both in the restaurant and its attached stores , and have a wistful memory of the `` old days . '' <sssss> the waitstaff was quick , well-versed in the menu , and very helpful and pleasant . <sssss> having read all the reviews of the food , we ate before we arrived , desiring only ice cream . <sssss> boy , they have a selection . <sssss> i mean items i have n't seen in 40 years . <sssss> my wife and i each ordered 2-scoop sundaes , figuring that one scoop would not be enough . <sssss> when a concoction as tall as my arm is long ended up on the table , i immediately remembered how it was `` back in the day '' when people actually gave you a hefty helping , rather than skimped/chinced on portion size . <sssss> the rocky road was the best i 've ever had . <sssss> this sundae was the `` real deal , '' packed with toppings , whipped cream , sauce , etc. . <sssss> here , they make them like they `` used to '' and boy was that a pleasant surprise . <sssss> truly a great and delicious experience . <sssss> i 'll be back for more ice cream items . <sssss> ca n't believe how much treat you get for your $ !!! 
5		one of the most fun places with really amazing food . <sssss> always love the veggie chicken tikka masala pasty . <sssss> the tomato soup and banoffee pie are excellent too . <sssss> big fan ! 
5		i 'm not sure why i keep putting off reviewing joe 's bbq , because it 's definitely one of my favorite restaurants in town . <sssss> i guess i have too many good things to say ! <sssss> here are just a few of them : the service is always friendly and fast and the food is cheap . <sssss> even though i 've never made it in on my birthday , i love that they offer a free complete meal on your day ! <sssss> in general i 'm not a big fan of bbq . <sssss> in fact , the only thing i ever get at joe 's is their chicken breast sandwich , but i 'm hooked for life . <sssss> the mac & cheese is amazing and i 've been known to get two portions of it because it is so good . <sssss> i recently discovered their cornbread , and it is also a winner . <sssss> the root beer cake was intriguing but not as good as i was hoping for , but the lemon cake is great . <sssss> oh and the chocolate chip cookies are the best i 've ever had . <sssss> my only little complaint , and it 's not even something that can be fixed because of the restaurant setup , is how it is difficult to get drink refills when there is a long line . <sssss> i always feel awkward trying to maneuver my way through the line up to the drink area . <sssss> it 's probably a good thing i do n't live closer to joe 's because i 'd be in every single day . <sssss> no joke . 
5		i love this place ; i have been here several times . <sssss> the first time i walked in , i felt i was on the set of scarface so i was immediately intrigued . <sssss> i have had a lot of calamari fritti , and i have to say avanti 's is the best . <sssss> not overly greasy and very crispy . <sssss> their gnocchi and risotto have also been amazing . <sssss> the owner , angelo , will make it around to you if he is there . <sssss> i have also sat at the bar with friends and had some good conversations with john , who has been there for the long haul . <sssss> the service is great , but a little different from what people are used to -lrb- servers dropping off the check at their convenience , etc. -rrb- . <sssss> avanti 's servers want you to have an elegant dining experience , and they are mindful of your experience . <sssss> they will not clear your plates until they are absolutely sure you are finished or give them a signal -lrb- napkin on plate or even a nod -rrb- . <sssss> if you have wine to finish , they will stand back and let you enjoy it and the company you 're with , even if they have locked the doors and want to go home . <sssss> my party and i have been the last to leave on a couple of occasions , and they are greatful for your patronage and do not act at all put out for being there a little later . <sssss> they are attentive without being pushy or intrusive . <sssss> that is class . <sssss> yes , the prices may be higher than what you would pay at some other italian restaurants , but i believe you are also paying for the experience and great service on top of the delicious food . 
5		if you like sushi , go here . <sssss> yup . <sssss> the big five stars . <sssss> and they deserve every single star . <sssss> i have tried quite a few sushi places , comparing them to my `` home '' sushi restaurant , and every single time , that restaurant had n't compared ... until we came here . <sssss> we were intending to go to rubio 's for a quick dinner after a party and then go hang out at home . <sssss> we have wanted to come here for weeks -lrb- since they opened this surprise location -rrb- and they had always been closed , and when coming up on rubio 's tonight , they were still open , so we switched to sushi mode . <sssss> walk in and you are visually greeted with a wide open room of maybe 10 tables and 3 booths on the side , and of course your sushi bar . <sssss> we asked to be seated at the bar . <sssss> we like to watch the sushi chef make their creations and check out the care of the fish . <sssss> i was originally turned off by how the chef left the doors to the cooler with the fish open . <sssss> it concerned me ... it 's arizona ... we are hot , and i do not want my sushi at room temperature since it 's so easy to get sick from meats at that temperature . <sssss> we received the first of our standard first fare with a new sushi restaurant - salmon sashimi and yellowtail sashimi and i actually said , out loud , `` wow . '' <sssss> now , mind you , i am used to large portions of sashimi and used to fairly large steak slices of fish in my sashimi . <sssss> these were huge steaks of fish !! <sssss> we got like 6 steaks of salmon and 5 steaks of yellowtail and they were so thick and barely out of frozen -lrb- this explains why he left it open ... he wanted them to thaw -rrb- ... i bit into it and the yummy goodness of these fish was just perfect . <sssss> i was greatly happy and looked forward to getting our specialty rolls . <sssss> the first to come out , perfect timing after finishing our sashimi , was the godzilla roll . <sssss> the roll was very nice looking , large pieces , and an even number of pieces . <sssss> took a bite ... holy ... crap . <sssss> these guys know taste !! <sssss> i might have to put these guys up on par with my home sushi restaurant ! <sssss> i do n't know about you , but the guilt of saying that someone else has the same amount of skill with the sushi knife and taste in comparison to the restaurant you have been so loyal to for 5 years ... it 's rough . <sssss> so i was thinking , `` ok . <sssss> let 's try the next roll . <sssss> if they meet expectations then ... i 'll cross that bridge when i get to it . '' <sssss> ... dammit , now here 's the bridge . <sssss> we got the arizona roll . <sssss> very tasty ... an excellent mix of sweet , spicy , and bold . <sssss> the sauces were incredible . <sssss> i purely expected a clash to occur considering the three sauces that were on top of this roll , but oh my god . <sssss> i 'm in trouble . <sssss> next roll ... the baked scallop roll . <sssss> i love scallops . <sssss> they are my favorite ... raw , grilled , sauteed , or baked . <sssss> these were even better baked on top of a california roll with the unagi sauce . <sssss> very good , not too much , but very sweet . <sssss> so , being the foodie i am , i 'm discussing this quietly with my partner at the bar . <sssss> it 's like the staff there psychically understood how we were rating them and they approach us and ask what we think . <sssss> i told them it 's excellent and explained why . <sssss> the chef offered us some cold chopped oranges to cool the palate after our intense meal with our beer and sake . <sssss> a perfect topper ! <sssss> i feel i ca n't even express how surprised i am that they were so excellent . <sssss> i purely expected these guys to be normal ... like takamatsu or ah-so ... and was blown away by their incredible `` taste '' abilities . <sssss> the people were very nice . <sssss> take out is available . <sssss> we are going back . <sssss> we were watching the chef make other rolls ... we have already decided what other rolls we are getting . <sssss> if you like sushi ... go here . 
5		you have to like total wine . <sssss> why ? <sssss> because if you are coming there you want booze and you want it for a cheap price . <sssss> i used to go to other places but i will go out of my way to come here because i know i will save overall . <sssss> yay for alcohol ! 
5		i have been going to desirable skin since it opened ... so about 4 years . <sssss> franchesa is a wonderful esthetician . <sssss> she is knowledgable and uses great products . <sssss> also , she does n't push products . <sssss> she has plenty products for sale but does n't push you into buying anything . <sssss> i have had all sorts of treatments from franchesa . <sssss> i use her for laser hair removal , peels , eye lash tinting , facials , derma plaining and waxing . <sssss> i also see barbara for botox . <sssss> she is great . <sssss> i am very happy with the results that both franchesa and barbara give me . 
5		my husband to be and i had a great date night here . <sssss> we made a reservation using open table and were seated promptly when we came in . <sssss> our waiter gary was fabulous and provided great recommendations on the menu . <sssss> he was fun and knew the menu well . <sssss> we had great drinks and great food . <sssss> we tried the crab cakes and mac n cheese both to start with . <sssss> my hubby to be got the filet and i got the meatloaf and everything was super yummy . <sssss> definitely will go back and bring friends ! 
5		so , i have mostly been to the little grocery store and not the actual farmers market -lrb- as i usually am at work when the peeps are peddling their wares . -rrb- <sssss> i was fortunate enough to hit it on saturday , however , and man oh man , wow !! <sssss> there were so many people and dogs and everything ! <sssss> there was much to take in : multiple small farms with their veggies and fruits -lrb- and most of them were selling their seedlings , too ! -rrb- <sssss> , pickled things , salsa and hummus and other dips , breads , sweets , hand-made soaps and lotions , house plants , tamales , live music , food trucks galore , voter registration -lrb- which i totally did and you should , too ! -rrb- <sssss> , grass-fed beef , eggs , crafts , house items , and more ! <sssss> i loved walking around and seeing what everyone had to offer . <sssss> people seemed in such good spirits there and i had a blast . <sssss> ca n't wait to go back and actually buy some stuff -lrb- i was too awestruck to know what i wanted -rrb- . 
5		i just received my chairs back from giovanni , and i could n't be happier . <sssss> i had two mid century arm chair reupholstered . <sssss> his service from beginning to end was very professional and i will be using him again in the future . <sssss> one thing that i really liked is that pick up and delivery are included with his services . <sssss> i own my own business and with my crazy schedule this was a huge help . <sssss> highly recommended ! 
5		well ? <sssss> how deep is the well ? <sssss> not shure but i 'll be happy to share another update about this gym . <sssss> i 've mentioned that i 'm very happy with my boot camp style gym but now that i 'm training for my first full marathon , it 's way too hot for me to complete long runs . <sssss> if i do n't manage to get out and start at a certain time in the mornings , it wo n't happen . <sssss> so today , i went in to tangible to start up again . <sssss> zumba classes are now offered at no cost to members -- i 'll be willing to shake my g ` donk g ` donk and give it a try . <sssss> for $ 25 a month and no contracts , this little gym is perfectly located not far from where i live and i could get back into upper chest work in the weight room . <sssss> i love that the owner , chris , does n't run this place like a typical big name gym . <sssss> overall , i 'm happy to be back . <sssss> cheers *** ps ... if only there was an easier way to maintain my size 4 figure ... 
5		hands down , the best cheese steak in the valley . <sssss> i pretty much order the same thing every time i go ... the regular cheese steak with wiz , omg -lrb- onion , mushroom , green pepper -rrb- and sweet potato fries -lrb- and you get the drink for free when you order a side -rrb- . <sssss> you have to try their fry sauce ... i could drink that stuff straight ! <sssss> this is one of the few places that i get cravings for . 
5		just tried their sushi for the first time and the crunch roll was very good ! <sssss> impressive for a grocery store . 
5		one of the best lunches i 've ever had was eaten at the capital grill . <sssss> sure , it might have been because it was free and i was able to order anything i wanted . <sssss> plus , we got complimentary apps and the dessert of our choice , but even then , the food was excellent . <sssss> trust me , `` excellent '' is not a word i throw around very often . <sssss> it was a business lunch , but i could n't help but admire the wine list and imagine coming back here for dinner sometime . <sssss> it would make a really great date place , especially if you splurged on the valet out front . <sssss> after all , it is the biltmore . <sssss> and , let 's face it , even i like getting dolled up every once in a while . <sssss> back to lunch . <sssss> i sampled the jumbo shrimp in the shrimp sauce , along with some really perfectly breaded calamari , which was the best calamari my lips have ever come across . <sssss> i ordered the crab/lobster burger , which was presented as a seafood mix between a whole grain bun . <sssss> every bite was better than the last . <sssss> i delightfully ate the entire thing . <sssss> then , it was time for dessert . <sssss> i chose the flour-less espresso cake . <sssss> unbelievable . <sssss> it was so thick and rich , though , that i left half behind . <sssss> then again , who really needs to eat the entire piece ? <sssss> granted , it was packed with so much sugar , i immediately began to droop into a mid-afternoon coma . <sssss> but , i did n't care . <sssss> i just had one of the best lunches of my entire life . <sssss> sometimes i remember that lunch and i shake my head . <sssss> never mind it was for business . <sssss> never mind i did n't have any wine . <sssss> never mind i had to go back to work after wards . <sssss> i still rate that lunch and this restaurant at 5 stars . <sssss> imagine how wonderful this could be if you order a glass of wine and go for a special occasion with a special someone . <sssss> wow . <sssss> talk about needing more stars for that ! 
5		best mechanic shop ever . <sssss> extremely helpful employees . <sssss> the place is clean as a whistle . <sssss> phil was very helpful on explaining what my car needed . <sssss> i respect honest mechanics that are there to help fix a problem and not sell you something you do n't need . <sssss> the repair was going to take a while so kelly gave me a ride home while my car is getting fixed . <sssss> very friendly guy . <sssss> all in all , i will be coming back again for the customer service and the quality work and parts . 
5		we 've loved the classes we 've taken there . <sssss> we started taking classes before our wedding over a year ago , and we got hooked . <sssss> we were able to work privately with one of the instructors to prepare for our wedding in addition to taking weekly ballroom classes . <sssss> as beginners , we did n't feel out of place , and the others in our classes were very friendly . <sssss> after taking a hiatus for a while , we returned to find the studio had been expanded and renovated . <sssss> there 's so much more space now , and more class offerings at a variety of levels . <sssss> we started taking one of the swing courses , and the instructor is outstanding and makes the class enjoyable . <sssss> it 's affordable too . <sssss> such a fun mid-week activity and social opportunity . <sssss> glad we found this place . 
5		very nice neighborhood spot . <sssss> the mussels are great and both pork dishes we tried were outstanding . <sssss> the bacon-cheddar biscuits make the meal and fig pecan pie is the perfect finish . 
5		i recently visited az 88 and ventured away from my typical chicken sandwich route . <sssss> ok , so i did n't venture incredibly far , but i like to think it was a tad healthier route . <sssss> i ordered the az 88 chicken salad which is like the az 88 chicken sandwich sans bread . <sssss> it 's huge and topped grilled chicken marinated in buffalo sauce and accompanied with veggies -lrb- including avocados -rrb- and a bed of lettuce . <sssss> it could easily be shared , was delicious and did n't even need to blue cheese dressing that i asked for on the side . <sssss> definitely worth getting your next visit ! 
5		love the drive-thru . <sssss> trucked it on thru tonite and rolled out in less than 4 minutes with my super cheap carton of marlboros and a smile on my face . <sssss> the lady at the window was awesome and funny . <sssss> why pay more for name-brand cancer ? 
5		this place is simply amazing ! <sssss> i wish every breakfast place would model themselves after az bread co ! <sssss> this place is ultra bright and cheery , which is so perfect for the morning . <sssss> there are tons of tables and chairs , so you 'll be hard pressed to not find a seat . <sssss> the ordering system is perfect for breakfast , you place your order , get a number , and sit down . <sssss> the drinks are self serve so it 's really nice to not have to wait for any servers when you are starving like i always am at breakfast time . <sssss> everyone who works here is quick and efficient , running like a well oiled machine . <sssss> now the food ... do yourself a huge favor and get over here on the weekend ! <sssss> they advertise a pecan waffle , pancake , or french toast special here on yelp . <sssss> i decided i would have that . <sssss> best decision ever ! <sssss> it was so amazingly good . <sssss> the waffle was fluffy and sweet and the pecan compote was dreamy . <sssss> just imagine loads of caramelly sweet crunchiness covering an already perfect waffle . <sssss> are you in heaven now ? <sssss> you should be . <sssss> i promise it will be mind blowing . <sssss> i kind of love this place , as if you could n't tell already . <sssss> i am going to be trying to find excuses to make our way down here more often ! 
5		great haopy hour deals good vibe 
5		i am amazed at the new lux , which will more than likely come to be my favorite hangout . <sssss> i went there with a couple of friends last night , and we plan on going back every sunday night ! <sssss> what i love ... - huge space , with numerous rooms - yet it still manages to maintain a cozy atmosphere . <sssss> feels like you 're hanging out at some cool friend 's house . <sssss> - they play etta james ! <sssss> - excellent chai . <sssss> excellent coffe . <sssss> and the enormous cups & saucers are fun . <sssss> - sublime dessert ... mmm ! <sssss> i love their protein bar - i ca n't even finish the whole thing . <sssss> - creative , fun decor . <sssss> - they serve dinner -lrb- braised escarole ! <sssss> omg ! -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> - ample seating - various table/chair/sofa configurations . <sssss> - not your `` average joe '' , run-of-the-mill customers . <sssss> good place for people-watching -lrb- which , as an ex-nyer , i miss very much -rrb- . <sssss> chummy atmosphere ; a charming , older couple sitting next to us , for example , were raving about their dinner , and one of them insisted that my friend try a bite of her pork loin . <sssss> easy to talk to strangers here . <sssss> - a positive , uplifting vibe . 
5		delicious ! 
5		i 've been a fan of port of subs since i moved out here to phoenix back in 2005 . <sssss> i love everything about them , and last night was no exception . <sssss> it was friday night and i was hungry !!! <sssss> but , of all the port of subs , this ones open nice and late . <sssss> 9pm during the week !!! <sssss> in other port of subs reviews , i have openly complained about the horrible hours that the hold , such as closing early -lrb- like 6pm on week nights -rrb- and some are closed on sundays ... others close at 4pm on saturdays . <sssss> really ? <sssss> lunch only ? <sssss> you ca n't do like 7pm ? <sssss> so this one 's my favorite just due to the hours alone . <sssss> i came here with my friend after hitting up a few other places . <sssss> it 's located right next to lowe 's in a little strip mall . <sssss> i went with the turkey and pastrami 5 inch sub as i always did , and really enjoyed it . <sssss> staff was friendly , and food was prepared quickly . <sssss> i will be back , and enjoy myself every time i 'm here ! 
5		the weather is cooling down , and wearing a long sleeve shirt is about to be the norm . <sssss> what goes better with cool weather than a hot bowl of soup ? <sssss> a hot bowl of pho with meatballs and brisket from this place ! <sssss> this was the best pho that i 've had in arizona ; the broth is flavorful , meat cooked to perfection , vegetables fresh and green . <sssss> the staff was incredibly friendly , offering small cups of soup as a sample , and even offering my girlfriend the opportunity to change her order if it was not to her liking . <sssss> -lrb- she was a bit braver than i and got a more traditional vietnamese bowl , which she loved -rrb- the restaurant was clean , bathrooms were nice , and they even had the uofa football game on the tv ! <sssss> i highly recommend this place over any other pho restaurant in town . <sssss> check it out ! 
5		defalcos is great , i had the chicken alfredo and my lunch date had the cheese steak sandwich . <sssss> both were absolutely wonderful ! <sssss> i had no problem with the wait because i knew that the food would be worth it , as i read from other people 's reviews . <sssss> the service was friendly , and it had a real down to earth atmosphere : -rrb- 
5		this is the best hooters location i 've been to in az ! <sssss> server : desiree time & date : thursday nov. 27th at around 6pm environment : very clean , and the outside patio has the comfiest seats too ! <sssss> service : i 've been to several hooters before , and being a woman it can be a little awkward at times . <sssss> i have either encountered the stuck up servers who ca n't remember or get an order right to save their life and i 've also had the servers who try to invade my personal space while calling me `` sweetie '' or `` hun '' for a better tip . <sssss> finally i have arrived at a place where they treat you like normal human beings ! <sssss> my waitress was so kind , she opened conversation not by `` what do you want to drink '' and rushing away but by approaching me with a smile and a `` how was your day '' . <sssss> and i can tell you that after a long day at work that was really refreshing to see and that kind of customer service goes a long way . <sssss> she was also very attentive , checking several times to make sure our food was hot and to our liking and that our drinks were always filled . <sssss> the manager even stopped by to see how everything was . <sssss> great service and i will definitely be back ! <sssss> thank you ! 
5		i was on yelp looking for a good pizza joint in my new area and found something so much better `` the parlor '' my boyfriend had mentioned this place before and i said something snarky like `` the parlor of what ... what is it a massage parlor ... '' my deepest apologies to the parlor !!!!! <sssss> this place is awesome . <sssss> our first visit we ordered a selection of cheese and meats , the beet salad , the veal ravioli and the cherry zeppole . <sssss> the atmosphere is comfortable and casual , there were all ages and kinds dining . <sssss> nummy cheese and meat ! <sssss> beet salad was good and fresh , the veal ravioli was bowl licking good . <sssss> -lrb- and yes he did it twice -rrb- the desert was soo good . <sssss> gorgeous little round nuggets of sweet , tender , fluffy , light , cherry goodness . <sssss> i ca n't say enough about this place . <sssss> you have to go and see for yourself . <sssss> we will be back and we will eventually order everything off the menu ! <sssss> oh yea and we were out the door for under fifty dollars ! 
5		no longer a korean cuisine virgin ... and even though i have nothing to compare this place too ... it was fabulous . <sssss> first the service ... seating quickly and our drink order was taken immediately . <sssss> when the waitor return with the drinks , he walked us through their menu ... pointing out his favorite dishes ... but more importantly ... helping us decide between the two dishes we were interested in ... this is great since at that point i was still a korean cuisine virgin . <sssss> my choice ... with my wiater 's recommendation ... nakji dol pan ... octopus stir fried in a spicy sauce and served on a sizzling stone plate . <sssss> second the food ... the food came quickly and was unbelievable ... though spicy , not too spicy ... however , the spiciness does grow on you over time . <sssss> the octopus , was cooked perfectly and almost melted in your mouth ... and the side enhanced the overall taste of the dish . <sssss> i will now definately try other korean restaurants ... but it will be hard to surpass the experience i have here at hodori restaurant . 
5		fantastic ! <sssss> i love this place , quick and delicious 
5		awesome food , never fails at all . <sssss> just do n't be in a hurry to be anywhere ! 
5		ate dinner here tonight . <sssss> fantastic atmosphere and food . <sssss> the happy hour specials are fantastic and the food is perfection . <sssss> good wine and a good time ! <sssss> also , there was a live musician , cameron , playing on the patio and he was the perfect addition to the atmosphere . <sssss> highly recommend ! 
5		al-hana makes me sad for one reason : i am so in love with the falafel that i still have n't had a chance to try their world-famous cheese pizza thingies . <sssss> for the uninitiated , al-hana is the restaurant that occupies one corner of baiz market , the amazing middle eastern grocery at 20th and roosevelt . <sssss> if you want amazing food , period , you got ta eat here . <sssss> the pitas are baked in-house and they are amazing . <sssss> flavorful , soft , just chewy enough , and perfect . <sssss> the falafel is seasoned perfectly and fried to a crunchy perfection . <sssss> the babaganouj is impressive , as is the hummus . <sssss> the only thing i am not 100 % in love with is the tabbouleh , which is just a tad short on lemon flavor for my taste . <sssss> if you 're feeling like a salad , i would recommend the fettoush salad instead , as it is an unexpected delight . <sssss> the set up is a bit on the disorganized side : the menu board is an incomprehensible mess , so you 're better off asking for a menu , or even better , describing what you want to the helpful staff . <sssss> the food does take a bit of time , so feel free to explore the market while you wait . <sssss> al-hana is a great place to take people who think that phoenix is just a city full of macaroni grills and cheesecake factories . <sssss> they will be surprised at what unique , authentic spots we have here in town ... but you might want to warn them about the whole goat in the butcher department first . 
5		i came here for the first time for their late night japanese fare and i would first like to say : a. i 'm furious with myself for not trying sooner . <sssss> b . <sssss> in an unprecedented first for me in the state of arizona , i am temporarily suspending my ongoing bitch that there is no good asian food in phoenix . <sssss> their menu consisted of three ramen dishes : miso , soy and i ca n't remember the other one . <sssss> i was fortunate to be among the first to arrive because i was able to order a fourth offering not on the menu which consisted of ramen in a miso-like broth that was darker , bolder and with a hint of ginger . <sssss> i have never liked miso but this was outstanding and exactly what my palate needed . <sssss> my dish also contained shrimp , calamari and other seafood . <sssss> i washed this down with two orion lagers for okinawa ... delicious !!!!! <sssss> and talk about a deal : the dishes were $ 10 - $ 12 each !!!! <sssss> i was still in shock that i was in arizona and was enjoying my meal so much and i was so lucky that i got there early because the seafood dish and the japanese beers were gone shortly after 10:00 pm . <sssss> i ran into bao h and wound up having a great evening with him and some other great people for a wonderful evening . <sssss> my girl ursula d was also there so it was great to run into some fellow yelpers . <sssss> i received a warm welcome from josh as i sat at the bar and i love the atmosphere here with the modern minimalist decor , sexy candlelight not to mention the great music that they play . <sssss> ieft a very happy camper and only a $ 35 dent in my wallet . <sssss> i 'm told that they are going to be doing the late night japanese fare one wednesday a month ... sign me up !!! <sssss> word of advice for this : get there early !!!! 
5		this is my favorite haunt . <sssss> whether it be st. patricks day , before a sundevil game or just a place to meet some friends for a quick drink . <sssss> gavin and the rest of the peeps are great . <sssss> the food is the good , whether out on the patio eating bar food or inside the dining room indulging in dinner . <sssss> this place will always be the primary place to grab a guinness for me . 
5		i was there today and the service was awesome . <sssss> the coffee was terrific . <sssss> it was a great place to hang out and get some work done ! 
5		i love bertha 's . <sssss> i love bertha 's sandwiches so much that i occasionally choose to ignore the fact that i am allergic to gluten and i order a real , gluten-infested bread sandwich . <sssss> the rest of the time i get salads , and they are so good that i do n't even feel bitter about the fact that i am eating a salad only because i ca n't eat bread . <sssss> they also make the best iced mochas i have ever had . <sssss> i 've watched them being made and i just ca n't figure out why -- i see the plain old hershey 's syrup going in , but there has got to be something else in that bottle . <sssss> the staff is always friendly and helpful , and they never even bat an eyelash when i ask for my salad in a to-go box and i 'm not to-going -lrb- because i like to put the yummy balsamic in it , close the lid , and shake it -rrb- . <sssss> glorious . <sssss> i only wish it was open on sundays -lrb- because nothing would be better than bertha 's when you 're hungover -rrb- and that it was open right now . <sssss> i ca n't wait for the grand re-opening ! 
5		another visit to my still - favorite spa stop in arizona . <sssss> i would compare this place to a fast-paced moroccan bazaar ... other than stopping in the circular rooms to clear your negative energy and make wishes on your way into the spa , it is all hustle and bustle of sometimes more than 20 people waiting for spa services in the lounge , and a packed spa terrace pool filled with people who do n't whisper . <sssss> this is the type of place you would do a girls spa party ... rent a cabana or spa suite and do it up right ! <sssss> gorgeous views of camelback mountain make up for the lack of peace and quiet ... i remembered to bring my ipod to block out chatter and noise for my return visit , which is perfect for my day-long lounging by the terrace pool . 
5		excellent food , a relaxed atmosphere , large portions , and outstanding desserts . <sssss> for those of you that need someone to come along and tell you where to sit , how to order , how to sit , what to eat , etc. on your `` date night '' ... go to starbucks and get yelled at ... . <sssss> leave the seats for someone more appreciative . 
5		sexy meets casual meets deliciousness meets something new that scottsdale was missing . <sssss> from the upscale look and dim lighting , it fits right in with the scottsdale crowd . <sssss> but the best part is , you can go here to just relax too . <sssss> they have lots of great seating whether it is intimate or larger group . <sssss> the music is playing , the game is on , and there is lots to look at . <sssss> did i mention the food is incredible ? 
5		i had the pleasure of living across the street from this treasure for about 6 years . <sssss> i 'm still lucky enough to work close by . <sssss> let me be clear . <sssss> i 'm reviewing haji baba as a grocery store first . <sssss> then i will give you some insight into the prepared food for take-out or in-store dining . <sssss> this is one of the few stores in arizona where you have several choices for pita bread -- it 's also the only place i 've found for whole wheat pita . <sssss> there are several choices for feta cheese . <sssss> danish , french , greek ... same with olives -- there are choices . <sssss> i always buy my tahini here . <sssss> all the prices are very inexpensive . <sssss> need spices ??? <sssss> they have them all . <sssss> at about 25 % of the price you would pay anywhere else . <sssss> the best way to describe haji baba is that it is a real grocery store , with real prices , for real people . <sssss> it is not a `` specialty store '' with trendy items and inflated prices . <sssss> they sell food items that you will actually use . <sssss> the bonus here ? <sssss> you wo n't find a 10 year old can or jar of something . <sssss> on to the `` restaurant '' portion . <sssss> haji baba is better if you think of it as a take-out joint that happens to have places to sit and eat . <sssss> they do have tables and they do perform table service , it 's just got zero charm . <sssss> you go for the food , that 's it . <sssss> okay , food . <sssss> the lamb tongue sandwich is to die for . <sssss> let me repeat . <sssss> the lamb tongue pita sandwich . <sssss> get it ! <sssss> their baba ganouj is also darned tootin ' tasty . <sssss> actually , i sometimes dream about their baba ganouj . <sssss> i 'm not crazy about their hummus , maybe because making hummus takes 5 minutes and mine is bomb ? <sssss> but it 's not bad . <sssss> gyros are good and not greasy . <sssss> greasy gyro meat is a pet peeve of mine . <sssss> chicken shwarma ? <sssss> yup , that 's good too . <sssss> i 'm sure i 've had something to eat here that i was a little disappointed in , but i honestly ca n't remember what , or when . 
5		totally loved it ! <sssss> it 's so quaint and charming . <sssss> i have been to some of the best hotels in the world , and this place rocks ! <sssss> here we go : - charming and professional . <sssss> not uptight like the ritz cartlon . <sssss> very , very personable staff - amazing food and will do special meals like vegan and gluten free . <sssss> breakfast served at 6am and coffee bar open . <sssss> so nice to be served early as some hotels have client wait till 7am - wonderful conceirge who helped me w local restaurants and hiking - amazing spa . <sssss> it 's like you have the place to yourself and the staff knows what they are doing - really nice gym w great equipment - little nocks and crannies of fireplaces , fountains and outdoor spaces . <sssss> i want my house to look and feel like this ! <sssss> i hope i get back to phoenix just to stay here again . 
5		i love how this place is so unassuming and i hope it is able to make it in phoenix . <sssss> i decided to do lunch there as i 've passed by it a million times and also tried stopping by there during business hours and it was n't open ! <sssss> well i know hippies and sometimes they lose track of time ... anyway , the parking was easy to find as i pulled into the alleyway just west of the building and squeezed my way into a space behind the building . <sssss> the smell of cooking beef hit me square in the face as i stepped out of my car and i observed people eating burgers on the back patio . <sssss> so far so good ! <sssss> the menu was easy to read and i tried the lunch special of a specialty burger of my choice -lrb- excellent to get to choose ! -rrb- <sssss> , fries , and a shasta -lrb- creme soda for me -rrb- for $ 5.25 . <sssss> the cramped lobby was filled with people waiting for their food and i noticed many people coming in and out , thinking this must be a good take out place . <sssss> i sat outside and hoped to attract more passerbys to the restaurant as many people gawked as they drove by at the businesses at that busy stretch of indian school . <sssss> got my bag of food and ate outside under the fans and shaded patio - wonderful ! <sssss> juicy guacamole burger with nothing needed to be added to it and crispy shoe string fries made for a meal i could n't even finish . <sssss> loved it ! <sssss> will be back very very soon ! 
5		absolutely delicious , a must try spot !! <sssss> fresh oj or lemonade for $ 3 , beer for $ 5 , add chicken to a salad for only $ 2 , and all the ingredients are farm fresh new orleans style . <sssss> lot 's of flavor , i had the portobello mushroom burger and it came on this great focaccia bread and was cut in quarters so easy to eat . <sssss> the brisket sliders are also quite good but a tiny bit heavy on the bbq sauce for me . 
5		went in to my first bike store to start shopping around and realized i did n't need to look any further ! <sssss> great help from adam , made us feel like we were the only ones in the store . <sssss> great honest service and a fun atmosphere , i would recommend this place if your are looking for a bike ! <sssss> ill be back soon to continue buying things for my bike !! 
5		hillstone is my new favorite ! <sssss> i almost always sit at the bar with friends to eat and watch what ever game is on . <sssss> jill is usually my server and she is wonderful . <sssss> the food has always been perfect . <sssss> i 'm a huge face of all their sushi as well as the japanese ribeye . <sssss> saturday is their chili and it is also exceptional . 
5		great customer service ! <sssss> the manager was great when my girlfriend wanted to switch the fallout : new vegas from the 360 to the ps3 , by telling him our situation , he was able to change it for us . <sssss> our 360 gave us the three-rings-of-death , so that 's why she decided to switch to ps3 . <sssss> i 've always received great service from them !! 
5		the stuffed quesadillas are simply amazing . <sssss> i love that you can watch them grilling the meat . <sssss> smells great , tastes delicious , wonderful service and very clean . <sssss> we 'll be back again and again !! 
5		so much cool stuff from uranium glass -lrb- did you know it glows under black light ? -rrb- <sssss> to mid century modern furniture to turquoise jewelery to the kooky or the rustic . <sssss> compared to other antique malls the prices are surprisingly low . <sssss> i keep finding the most oddball stuff that looks great in the living room . <sssss> check it out ! 
5		love going in here . <sssss> staff is always so helpful and i always end up finding more than what i came in for . <sssss> i must say that this is my favorite store of them all , , but overall i get very consistent helpful customer service at every petco that i go into . 
5		just bought my first bb suit at the new scottsdale quarter location . <sssss> the store is beautiful and the sales rep was awesome . <sssss> she was infinitely patient with me while i tried on at least 10 suits . <sssss> i finally picked one and sandals to match . <sssss> the bikini 's are pricey but are worth it when you see how unique they are . <sssss> i forget the sales girls name that helped me but she had bright red hair . <sssss> just want to give her a big thank you and commend her on the great customer service i recieved . <sssss> i 'm already planning my next purchase . <sssss> i hope bb is around for a long time ! 
5		i come here too often to write a unbiased review :-rrb- it is good food , great service -lrb- 80 percent of the time -rrb- and just a great place to bring friends , family , and out of town folks to . <sssss> i believe they would prefer the originality and creativity of the creations found here over a bunch of other chain breakfast places . <sssss> especially their omelette creations , which can go anywhere from a classic denver omelette to the new princess . <sssss> also check out their lunch sandwiches and burgers . <sssss> i had their chicken tortilla soup , and it was good . <sssss> i hear good things about their burgers too :-rrb- if you got a sweet tooth , check out their bread pudding for dessert . <sssss> its moist and warm , and just so very tasty . <sssss> read the other great reviews for more details , i need to focus on my food now . 
5		so , i 've been hearing about bosa donuts at work for awhile now , but as i do n't consider myself a donut person and typically try and watch my girlish figure , i have n't given them a whirl ... until ... now . <sssss> the hubs and i happen to be in the glendale area saturday afternoon and pass by . <sssss> as we did , i said , `` bosa donuts ... i hear those are good . '' <sssss> he practically insisted we stop that instant , as they really are that good . <sssss> ok , so it was saturday around 2pm . <sssss> not sure they had their typical selection out , but i got a coconut cinnamon topped donut and the hubs got a twisty one . <sssss> as soon as we got into the car we opened the bag and started stuffing our faces . <sssss> holly moley ! <sssss> the airy , sweet , fresh , goodness permeated the car . <sssss> it took everything in my power to save a piece to enjoy later . <sssss> these babies were so awesome ... thank god this place is n't closer to our house ... that would be disastrous to my aforementioned girlish figure -lrb- which would be nonexistent if i had access to these gems regularly -rrb- . <sssss> in one word , go ... you will not regret it -lrb- unless you live nearby -rrb- . 
5		everything about this place rules the bakery , my fav is the pan dulce and they have never ending varieties of everything , the kitchen part is great food to order great prices , the refresco cold drink bar with fresh fruit yummm . <sssss> it is a huge place and has lot 's of elbow room . <sssss> if you are into meat you will love their meat dept. it is muy gigante ! <sssss> fun fun place for everyone for sure !! 
5		yes yes yes everything was great my husband had pumpkin french toast that he still hasnt stopped talking about and i had great fluffy pancakes , didnt wait on any line probably because it was july and durning the week but i would wait a line i really love how clean it was and how great the food was we will be back 
5		going out to breakfast is something i love to do because i love eggs and corn beef hash . <sssss> i basically order the same thing at every breakfast restaurant i go to -lrb- it makes it really easy to form an opinion -rrb- . <sssss> i 'm pretty sure my small cholesterol issue can be blamed completely on my obsession on over medium eggs ! <sssss> if you like corn beef hash order it here , it will not disappoint ! <sssss> the service is fast , friendly enough , the food is cheap , and tastes great if you are looking for a traditional diner breakfast . <sssss> many people before me mentioned again love it 
5		come to mama , pretty precious little drops of heaven . <sssss> and i 'm just talking about the packaging . <sssss> what 's inside the package is the real treat . <sssss> first off , do not eat your chocolate in the store . <sssss> buy it and have them wrap it all up and put it in the bag . <sssss> go home and sit down and eat your chocolate in at least 2 bite -- you hear me ?!! <sssss> two bites at least . <sssss> savor the taste and feel your heart skip a beat . <sssss> ** note : in the summer , go home right after the purchase and crank your a/c up on the floor board and place the godiva bag down there -- do not let it get ruined by the heat . 
5		since my friends kept raving about this new `` phenomenon '' called shaved snow / snoh , i had no choice but to try it out . <sssss> and i did try it for the first time yesterday and thoroughly enjoyed it . <sssss> i had the green tea shaved snow topped with red beans -lrb- a bit sweet , so i would ask for less red beans next time -rrb- and taro topped with an abundance amount of fresh mangos . <sssss> there 's a variety of asian inspired toppings for you to select from . <sssss> the consistency was pretty smooth . <sssss> to me , it was creamy between a mix of ice cream & yogurt . <sssss> the shaved snow was not too sweet , just the way i like it . <sssss> i opted out of getting condensed milk topped . <sssss> seemed like a general question they asked any shaved snow ordering customer , so if you do n't like super sweet stuff , i would opt out . <sssss> after sitting in the food court devouring the shaved snow , i came back and purchased an order to go for my sister . <sssss> since it takes about 20 mins for me to get to my sister 's place , i asked the lady at the counter if she can put my order in a bag with some ice so it wo n't melt and she did so without hesitation . <sssss> she even double bagged it in case the ice melts ... and of course it did . <sssss> so nice of her ! <sssss> i also purchased the mung bean milk tea with grass jelly for my brother-in-law and as picky as the man was , he liked it . 
5		best chinese food in central phoenix . <sssss> it 's more expensive , but it 's totally worth it . <sssss> high quality ingredients , friendly service , and lots to choose from . <sssss> we ca n't go back to average chinese takeout after discovering this place . <sssss> you can order some dishes sauteed vs. breaded and fried . <sssss> healthier menu items than most local chinese options . 
5		wow ! <sssss> we were just there and i 'm thinking about going back again tomorrow . <sssss> seriously , they had a squash blossom stuffed with dungeoness crab , shrimp , sausage and manchego cheese . <sssss> it must be laced with something addictive , because i ca n't wait to get my hands on more . <sssss> equally as delicious was the duck breast with lingonberry sauce . <sssss> wow ! <sssss> done to perfection . <sssss> hubby had the short rib special and it melts in your mouth . <sssss> we actually had a groupon , but we will go back for sure , because even at full price , it 's worth every penny . <sssss> service and wine was impeccable too . 
5		very good ! <sssss> probably best to get there early , it 's a small establishment and can get quite busy . <sssss> the calamari and bruschetta were excellent ! <sssss> i had chicken marsala which was very tasty , but a humongous portion ! <sssss> i had a taste of the marinara sauce and italian ice cream and both were quite good . <sssss> definitely recommend it ! 
5		awesome vegetarian pho , summer rolls and thai iced tea . <sssss> i crave this food ! <sssss> it 's my favorite vietnamese style ... with lots of other options too . 
5		i 've been here twice now . <sssss> we went for my birthday and the ravioli was amazing ! <sssss> the bread was good , the vegetable beef soup was good . <sssss> our waitress was amazing . <sssss> normally when a waiter or waitress comes to your table , they ask if everyone 's doing okay , ours came asked how we were doing , my husband said we were okay , she made sure to turn to me and ask me as well , something i thought was really professional of her to do . <sssss> i am absolutely going back ! 
5		my favorite steak house chain and i have experienced them all . <sssss> as i travel around the country , i always check out the local high end steak place . <sssss> this is as good as it gets . <sssss> hedonistic . <sssss> tammy at the bar is a true service excellence professional . <sssss> highly recommend . 
5		like i ever would have doubted a chris bianco inspired concept . <sssss> evidently we ate at a different restaurant then the ones who have peppered yelp with their 3-star statements . <sssss> i found no tarnish on our five star experience . <sssss> the ambiance is comfortable and cozy just like he envisioned . <sssss> you do feel like family , especially when chris is personally visiting each table . <sssss> every dish sampled was simple yet elegant and flavorful . <sssss> nothing pretentious , just flawlessly executed family staples . 
5		called them and scheduled a pick up at downtown phoenix at 2:50 pm . <sssss> i stressed that they need to be on time because i need to make it to the airport on time . <sssss> the driver arrived 8 minutes early and told me he 'll wait and i can just come out at 2:50 pm . <sssss> very very courteous guy . <sssss> the ride to the airport was smooth and it cost wayyy cheaper than skyharbor cab . <sssss> very good experience , will use their service again if i `` m in phoenix . 
5		just visited here for the first time and the staff was so friendly ! <sssss> they even gave me extra punches on my card to help me get a free coffee next time since i 'm a newbie . <sssss> the cocomo is an awesome drink . <sssss> . <sssss> great coffee and great people ! 
5		i realllly loved this place !! <sssss> the whole family went and we each ordered the three tacos for $ 5 and some change , the chips and salsa $ 2.95 , and we also got their flavored lemonade . <sssss> we got the fish tacos , carne asada , pork , chicken , and chicken feta tacos ... we all loved them and the problem was not being able to finish them . <sssss> we could only eat two and ended up eating the other one later . <sssss> i got mine without the cabbage and was pleased that i did because it would have been too much . <sssss> i love that they put rice and beans in their tacos because this is how we do it at home . <sssss> the lemonade was so delicious ... i had the pomagranite and i was wishing they had free refills . <sssss> the chips and salsa was very good as well and they give you plenty of salsa . <sssss> the place is adorable and they folks that work there were friendly and helpful with suggestions on what to get . <sssss> i will be back to this place and also want everyone to check them !! 
5		i love this salon ! <sssss> gina and lilly are incredible and if you want a salon that caters to every need , this us your place ! <sssss> stop looking this is the best salon in town ... they rock ! 
5		my wife went to estrella women 's health center . <sssss> dr. b.j. ho was great and really helped my wife and i thought a difficult time . <sssss> highly recommended !!! 
5		i could eat here everyday ! <sssss> the hummus , the chicken , the atmosphere a + + + + 
5		this was our second time dining here and both times visits have been absolutely fantastic ! <sssss> the food and the quality are very good . <sssss> everything that we have eaten in this restaurant has been superb . <sssss> the last time i went i had a rib-eye that was fantastic . <sssss> the time before i had the four course chef meal and it was also fantastic . <sssss> what 's really need is to give you tickets to go on a gondola ride after the meal , unfortunately , the last time we went it was raining but they gave us vouchers to come back another time . <sssss> service was spot on and i really recommend this restaurant to anyone . 
5		omg the best baby back ribs i have ever tasted . <sssss> my favorite baby back ribs before this food experience was the mason jar in mahwah nj . <sssss> i have always compared baby back ribs to the mason jar to see if any would compare . <sssss> after over ten years of searching i have found the perfect baby back rib to beat the mason jar . <sssss> pork on a fork is truly world class . <sssss> no need for the bbq sauce but they have a nice variety and i tried two that i liked . <sssss> the hot bbq sauce and the carolina bbq style sauce were both excellent on my ribs . <sssss> however you know you are eating excellent ribs when you keep forgetting to pour on the sauce . <sssss> pork on the fork ribs were tender fall off the bone delicious . <sssss> i will return and bring all my rib loving friends . 
5		huauchinango ! <sssss> huauchinango is a city around 130 miles from mexico city in the sierra norte de pueblo mountains . <sssss> more importantly in my life , huauchinango is an inexpensive and delicious mexican restaurant that i can go to with ease . <sssss> i am told the cuisine at huauchinango is largely reflective of mexico city cuisine . <sssss> on my first visit -lrb- only visit so far but i will be back -rrb- i had 3 quesidilla 's . <sssss> and they were n't the things we make at my house . <sssss> they were joyful folded and sealed pockets of beef , chicken and shrimp with cheese , mushroom , onions , and other yummy stuff . <sssss> i was wowed at the outset by the chips and salsa . <sssss> both made in house , the chips were not greasy . <sssss> it came with three salsa 's . <sssss> one was a kind of a green chili tomatillo with a nice bright and fresh flavor and mild spice . <sssss> the next was a red chili salsa that had very little tomato . <sssss> it seemed a little watery at first but finished nicely with red chili heat . <sssss> the third was orange in hue and very smooth . <sssss> i was told it was habanero salsa . <sssss> it seemed to be made primarily from smoothly blended roasted habanero . <sssss> hot stuff . <sssss> thanks to donald s for the review that put it on my radar and then meeting me and brian s there for lunch . <sssss> outstanding ! 
5		really can not say enough great things about this little taco shop on chandler blvd. . <sssss> to say its a taco shop does n't do it justice . <sssss> we had a fish taco , carne asada taco and the el presidente burrito and they all were excellent . <sssss> we also got the chips , salsa and guacamole but we also added a side of their green chili that was out of this world !! <sssss> the have the bomb cocktails too ! <sssss> we started with their black cherry mojitos and ended with a drink called `` the mail order bride '' that literally was so good i could have drunk ten of them ! <sssss> definitely my new fav mexican food place ! 
5		ive been dying for a place that has to go soups other than the usual over priced paradise bakery . <sssss> they have like 5 different soups everyday . <sssss> . <sssss> and they are open till 7pm love this place . 
5		stayed the week of thanksgiving and was very happy with my experience - they were even able to accommodate my early check in request . <sssss> the hotel is more of a small apartment feeling with a fully stocked kitchen . <sssss> there 's a small gym on site , open 24/7 , and free breakfast in the morning . <sssss> the hotel is also pet friendly and the location ca n't be beat . <sssss> will definitely return . 
5		my husband and i drove from la to scottsdale and almost to scottsdale , one of our tires was going flat . <sssss> we went to discount tire on shea and they checked it and found it was a cracked wheel -lrb- the tires are new -rrb- . <sssss> they helped us get a new tire shipped from the east coast and put it on first thing the next morning . <sssss> they were nice , helpful , honest and affordable . <sssss> absolutely great service ! <sssss> i highly recommend them . 
5		this place has an awesome drive thru . <sssss> not a bad location either right off the 101 freeway and union hills . <sssss> again the drive thru service was fast and the people who work there know how to get things done i had my coffee in my within like 1 minute . <sssss> to be honest that 's not bad considering that i was the third car back , keep up the good work starbucks crew !! 
5		great for when i go on a diet especially with the lowest calorie options being the veggie sub and ham sub . <sssss> i love honey mustard on it which is fat free , 30 cal per serving . <sssss> although not advertised at most subways you can get the veggie burger patty sub . <sssss> this specific subway is clean , friendly , and quick so it 's like most subways around . <sssss> no complaints about this location . <sssss> perks : subways in the phoenix area are offering free 6 '' sub if you join their e-mail list ! <sssss> yay ! <sssss> also this subway gives you extra coupon print outs with your receipt like `` free drink with purchase '' and `` 20 % off catering . '' <sssss> fill out the survey -lrb- instruction on the receipt -rrb- and get a free cookie if you just write in the code that 's resulted at the end of the survey . <sssss> parking : watch out for the shopping cart minefield in th conclusion : i love subway ! 
5		amazing service and extremely friendly ! <sssss> i have a hayward northstar and they know the tricks that the other pool stores have no clue about . <sssss> they also rebuilt my motor which saved me over $ 200 ! <sssss> highly recommend them . <sssss> i will definitely use them again and again for all of my pool needs . 
5		this place was fantastic ! <sssss> i enjoyed everything about it , the food , the service and the atmosphere . <sssss> it was a million degrees outside so i sat inside at the bar . <sssss> extremely friendly bartender , friendly locals sitting next to me who totally wanted me to have some of their salad and fabulous food . <sssss> i ordered the grandma 's chicken/potato/gorgonzola pizza . <sssss> it was the st. louis/flat style . <sssss> it was to die for . <sssss> my dining companion had a sandwich . <sssss> i was told to get the deep dish cookie but , people people , there was no room for cookie . <sssss> next time . <sssss> had to send the left overs home with the friendly locals sitting next to me . <sssss> wow , were they ever so lucky to be sitting next to me that day ? 
5		the guys over at tobias automotive are so helpful and friendly ! <sssss> as a woman i would always worry if auto repair places are being honest about what needs to be done with my car . <sssss> with tobias i never have to worry , they are always super honest !! <sssss> i will never take my car anywhere else ! 
5		alright , i 'm officially off starbuck 's ... when i 'm in phoenix at least . <sssss> i ordered the coffee of course because how else are you going to determine the quality of a coffee house without testing the main ingredient . <sssss> so one iced coffee with irish cream and low fat milk ... boom ! <sssss> my new favorite coffee house . <sssss> the decor is quaint and artsy . <sssss> stone floors and brick walls mean a nice cool escape from the insane heat we all live in and the guys behind the counter actually seemed like they were happy to be at work . <sssss> i even like the building itself , which appears to be converted from a 50 's gas station with a single serving pump which now serves as the drive-through . <sssss> tomorrow morning i 'm gon na head down early and enjoy a newspaper in my new favorite coffee house . 
5		well i suppose i am kinda biased as i teach at yp . <sssss> but it was n't always that way . <sssss> i used to practice at other studios around town and had always enjoyed classes . <sssss> i meteric , the owner , through a business meeting and we got talking . <sssss> he invited me to practice and i have n't looked back . <sssss> since then i completed the 500 hour certification program and the studio is part of my life . <sssss> if you are looking for something different , go to pura . <sssss> the classes still give you the physical work out but what 's different is that you get the philosophy too . <sssss> not just a few new age words sprinkled in here and there but a truly holistic understanding of this ancient practice . <sssss> try it once . <sssss> you never know . <sssss> you might like it . 
5		a trane unit for less dinero than no-namer units ? <sssss> yeppers ! <sssss> they showed up on time for the quote . <sssss> they showed up on time for the actual installation , even with a 20 minutes heads-up call . <sssss> quote was n't some silly nickle and dime line-by-liner ... instead it was an all-in $ 4500 for a 3.5 ton trane machine , removal of old furnace , and all other little things required that i do n't care about . <sssss> they laid down sheeting wherever they walked in my house and left not a trace of their presence . <sssss> they refused my offers of bathroom and even washed their hands outside via hose rather than inside -lrb- kind of made me wonder if people treat them like dirt/animals ?? <sssss> regardless , these are great people -rrb- . <sssss> they used my programmable thermostat , using instructions from my computer that i pulled up -- no other company would do this , they all said they 'd have to use their `` free '' but non-programmable unit and that mine was n't compatible ... bs . <sssss> love that they offered to set mine up and spent extra time doing that . <sssss> my folks actually happened to meet the flores folks during my installation and were blown away by their professionalism , craftsmanship ... and amazing prices . <sssss> they actually just got their new ac and heater installed last week . <sssss> all in all , i got 7 quotes which was probably overkill . <sssss> flores was n't the absolute lowest price , but all things equal , i got a larger unit than the lowest quote . <sssss> and , a few salesmen from the rejected companies called and asked me info about who i went with and pricing , and they were all blown away by the price flores was able to offer for trane . <sssss> i absolutely could not recommend flores air conditioning any more ! 
5		classic sushi . <sssss> got ta love it . <sssss> staff very nice and helpfull . <sssss> easy to make friends . 
5		like most great places , a review is n't necessary , so i have n't done so . <sssss> my latest visit gave me the need to do so , though . <sssss> i need n't say what 's already been said , as most of the reviews are the same . <sssss> 1 -rrb- you will wait , no matter what time of day or time of year . <sssss> hot summer mornings , early , will have the shortest wait . <sssss> if you 've never been here , what you do is show up , write down your name and the number of people in your party , snag some water and find some shade . <sssss> it 's suggested you have good company or a book - you can get bored waiting ! <sssss> 2 -rrb- all the food is good . <sssss> all the food is fresh . <sssss> if there is a daily special , get it . <sssss> 3 -rrb- everyone rants and raves about the potatoes . <sssss> i could remove one star just to prove a point , but this is a five star place . <sssss> the hashbrowns are good because of the potatoes . <sssss> they are extremely fresh and full-flavored , unlike anything you get at most restaurants . <sssss> that said , they 're not the * worlds greatest hashbrowns everrrrrrrrrrrr * . <sssss> they 're fantastic , but they are a bit mushy on the inside . <sssss> they are possibly the very best potatoes in town , all said and done . <sssss> 4 -rrb- four barrel coffee is served here now , instead of cave creek . <sssss> i 'm all for this . <sssss> despite it not being local , it is better than a lot of local roasts . <sssss> 5 -rrb- go here . 
5		okay , i 'm not usually a 5-star critic , since every dining experience can be improved a bit somewhere . <sssss> but with the return of trader vic 's special chefs dinners the chef justin pfeilsticker -lrb- had to look that one up -rrb- , outdid himself . <sssss> incredible . <sssss> last night 's dinner showcased cruzan rum drinks and the chef 's challenge , working with the sponsoring mixologist , is to coordinate the 4 courses with the 4 special drinks . <sssss> dinner and drinks where $ 65 plus we could keep tabs on the suns in playoffs in the bar . <sssss> in the end , i was kicking myself for not gathering all of my foodie friends to join me - they would have been in heaven . <sssss> lobster , crab and grouper cocktail to start , paired with a classic daiquiri that was perfectly balanced . <sssss> second course ; chicken and morel mushrooms -lrb- amazing -rrb- with black-eyed peas - matched with an amazing black raspberry rum cocktail . <sssss> okay , i admit , i had to lick the plate . <sssss> there was no way i was letting that reduction sauce go to waste . <sssss> third course was absolutely prefect , fresh scallops and a sweet potato polenta with another incredible pineapple/butter sauce . <sssss> paired with a spiced rum mango cocktail that was smooth , not too sweet and really interesting . <sssss> dessert was a crisp bread pudding with a bit of rum gelato and matching sauce . <sssss> not too much and not heavy , but just enough sweet to finish the meal . <sssss> the cocktail was a whipped coconut creme . <sssss> delightful . <sssss> now my experience with trader vic 's chef 's dinners is that they are n't planned that far in advance -lrb- whereas the hotel valley ho 's zu zu dinners are more consistent - and also very good -rrb- . <sssss> so getting a seat at the next dinner may require a bit of research . <sssss> according to the manager , they would like to host one monthly through the summer and they try to limit the seating to about 60 to keep the food quality as high -lrb- and i suppose the drinks as cold -rrb- . <sssss> since i recognized a number of faces from last year 's chef 's dinners - there seems to be a good following of insiders . <sssss> and at this price for incredible , interesting and very special food -lrb- you should have seen the morels and fresh scallops -rrb- with all the drinks - it 's a wonder there is n't a waiting list a mile long . <sssss> so 5-stars . <sssss> no question . 
5		i 'm really happy i found this place . <sssss> it 's tucked away in a strip mall slightly off the main road . <sssss> the interior is casual kinda cute and homey . <sssss> the food is great ! <sssss> the pastries are delicious , the chocolates are hand made . <sssss> they have some unique creations as well , like jujube tea for example . <sssss> it 's a locally-owned shop , and the owners are nice , down-to-earth and talented . <sssss> they also source some of their ingredients locally , which is always a great way to support our community ! <sssss> if you are particular about your pastries , come here and you will not be disappointed . <sssss> the coffee is good too . <sssss> really , this place is so much better than the starbudgets down the street . <sssss> i 'm so thrilled to see a quality establishment open in the area . <sssss> i hope a trend begins . 
5		love this place . <sssss> greatest concept ! <sssss> its fresh and you can put more or less of food you want and you can see them cooking your food instead of it being closed off not knowing whats going on back there ! <sssss> everyone working there is kind and upbeat and are always on top of things . <sssss> i can not tell you enough to come and try this place ! <sssss> its fun . 
5		one night , i was futzing around on yelp and came across this new place . <sssss> there were a lot of good reviews , so i went out the next day on a mission to try this place and review it , too ! <sssss> while the location is great -lrb- across the way from sidebar -rrb- , the parking kind of sucks , but i found a spot eventually -lrb- it was also lunch time on a weekday , so that 's probably my bad -rrb- . <sssss> i met a friend there , and we were eager to see what all the hype was about . <sssss> basically , everyone is right ! <sssss> it 's like chipotle or subway , but with sushi ! <sssss> what a great concept !!! <sssss> you can choose white or brown rice with either soy skin -lrb- which i thought sounded effing gross -rrb- or the traditional seaweed -lrb- way better ! -rrb- <sssss> and then you can pick three veggies -lrb- anything additional is 50 cents more -rrb- and you can add meat -lrb- s -rrb- for a little extra , too . <sssss> i opted for the seaweed with brown rice and added avocado , cukes , sprouts and asparagus to it . <sssss> it was quite a nice little green roll , if i do say so myself -lrb- and i do -rrb- . <sssss> they take the roll and put it in this nifty roll cutter , and out comes 10 perfectly cut sushi pieces . <sssss> then as you move closer to the register , they ask if you 'd like any toppings -lrb- crispy tempura , roe , sesame seeds , etc. -rrb- they have all kinds of sauces : ponzu , soy , teriyaki glaze , sweet chili , sriracha , eel , and maybe more that i ca n't remember . <sssss> you can also grab a bowl of miso soup or some edamame just in case you want a little something extra . <sssss> when i went to pay , my rolls were only about 4 dollars plus my drink = 6 dollar meal . <sssss> woo ! <sssss> when you go to the condiment bar , it 's full of ginger and wasabi and two big iced tea pitchers and then two more that are full of ponzu and soy sauce . <sssss> it was awesome and i was in condiment heaven !! <sssss> i grabbed some of the hibiscus tea and was ready to go . <sssss> the roll was soo delicious and the tea was surprisingly good . <sssss> i went back for more , and grabbed a roll to go for my woman and a cucumber salad -lrb- they also have a squid salad and a seaweed salad -rrb- . <sssss> all in all , my expectations were met and then some and my friend really enjoyed her meal , as well . <sssss> the food was great , the staff was friendly and helpful -lrb- they saw the look on my face as i walked up and totally knew i did n't know what i was doing -rrb- , they explained how everything worked and made my experience that much better . <sssss> ca n't wait to come back ! 
5		good food , service and atmosphere . <sssss> if i lived here this would be our hot spot . 
5		pizza is great ! <sssss> i just finished cleaning their kitchen , bathrooms , and front lobby area tile ! <sssss> it looks great if i may say . <sssss> go check them out the food tastes really good . <sssss> they make their dough from scratch every day ! <sssss> smells good in their facility too . 
5		love it ! <sssss> i get 15 % , 20 % , 30 % coupons off all the time . <sssss> coupons are good for the sale items too . <sssss> i buy my grandson and granddaughter 's clothes there . <sssss> hubby and all 3 of my grow sons love shopping there . <sssss> place is great . <sssss> i do n't shop for clothes for my family any where else . 
5		i 'll get right to it . <sssss> their fried chicken is the best . <sssss> it blows lolo 's out of the water ! <sssss> it has a light , crisp coating , the chicken itself was juicy and well-seasoned . <sssss> per usual , i got the hot sauce bottle at the ready . <sssss> but after tasting that chicken , i set it right back into the rack . <sssss> it did n't need a thing . <sssss> honestly , the chicken was better the first time i went , rather than the second time . <sssss> i think the second time , they cut back on the salt . <sssss> there was great praise for the fried catfish and the red beans . <sssss> my dining companion is from new orleans , and she raved about the red beans . <sssss> she claimed they are the closest thing to the real deal that she has tasted , outside of n.o. i thought they had a slight earthy , smoky flavor to them , that i could n't quite pinpoint -lrb- maybe sage or file ? -rrb- <sssss> , but was quite tasty . <sssss> the cornbread was mighty fine too -lrb- iirc , it was sweetened -rrb- . <sssss> next time , i 'll pass on the mac and cheese . <sssss> i thought it was pretty bland -- tasted mostly of the starchy sauce , little of the cheese . <sssss> the noodles were cooked to oblivion . <sssss> but mac and cheese is such a subjective matter . <sssss> i am sure there are many others who will love it . <sssss> the greens were really delicious . <sssss> salt , fat , sweet , and spice were all represented in just the right ratio . <sssss> i have not tried the desserts , so i can not comment on them . <sssss> i did note that they have red velvet cake , and several soda cakes . <sssss> yum ! <sssss> atmosphere-wise , it is a comfortable little place that has live music and comedy on the weekends and evenings . <sssss> the staff is super-friendly and even a little chatty . <sssss> so stop by lil mama 's and have some chicken ! 
5		wow . <sssss> i do n't even know where to begin with this review . <sssss> i will not rattle off all of the names of the dishes to try because quite simply every single dish i have tried at this place is absolutely fabulous . <sssss> we always go for the buffet because its the best way to taste a little bit -lrb- or a lot -rrb- of everything and the price is unbeatable . <sssss> the staff super friendly and courteous ! <sssss> the spectacular food and a nice tall cold taj makes for an unbelievable dinner ... or lunch . <sssss> this place is five stars all the way ! <sssss> when you compare what you get for your money elsewhere , this place takes the prize . <sssss> every person we bring to this restaurant is amazed and you will be amazed too ! 
5		i do n't get my nails done very often , but when i do i go here because they last a long time . <sssss> the shop is very clean and decorated nicely , which i like . <sssss> this place is good for groups too ... i brought my bridal party here , and they were able to work on all of us at the same time so that we could socialize without waiting around . <sssss> the staff is very friendly . <sssss> i come to get my eyebrows done too because they do n't make them too thin , and they take walk-ins . <sssss> i have recommended this place to all of my girlfriends , and i will keep going back ! 
5		great place for that special sit down dinner . <sssss> great food and friendly staff make for a enjoyable time . 
5		silvana is the best most innovative mexican chef on the planet as far as i am concerned . <sssss> i am talking authentic high quality ingredients blended with great love and super creative artistry . <sssss> this is not americanized super sized mexican . <sssss> this is a heavenly experience !!!!!!!!! <sssss> save a seat for me at the bar i plan to work my way through the menu one sublime bite at a time 
5		great vibe , deconstructed meatballs and market kale salad are great . <sssss> beautiful people serving you with a dj spinning . <sssss> what coukd be better ? <sssss> in the heart of scottdales bar scene . 
5		i booked tiffany over the web for my destination beach wedding . <sssss> i put my faith in her as our timeline did not permit a trial run and i was absolutely blown away with her work . <sssss> she did hair and make-up for 4 plus hair for my flower girl and was nice enough to squeeze mother of the bride in for make-up . <sssss> she was extremely friendly , very professional , and took time with each of us to make sure everyone was satisfied with our final look . <sssss> i would highly recommend her , she is truly an artist and i could n't be happier with the way we all looked when i look through my wedding album . <sssss> wish i lived in state because i would definitely be a return customer !!!!! 
5		one bite and i felt like i was in thailand , all that was missing was the sand to sink my toes in . <sssss> i had a seasonal special which had pumpkin . <sssss> it was fabulous . <sssss> my husband had the green curry and he had it hot just the way he liked it . <sssss> he usually eats things extremely spicy but the hot but perfect , he did not order the thai hot which could have been too hot even for him . <sssss> the wine list was pretty good for a thai place . <sssss> i will most definitely be going back for more . 
5		the barber parlor is the real deal ! <sssss> was in town for a few days and wanted to locate a real barber shop . <sssss> i hit gold ! <sssss> it 's great to see a young man running his own business at such a friendly and professional level . <sssss> will save the long hair if i ever know i 'm coming back to phoenix . <sssss> first class place . 
5		best happy hour in the valley . <sssss> prime steak burger , string fries and do n't forget to start with the sweet pepper calamari - you wont be disappointed . 
5		i went to mad hatter based on other yelpers ' recommendations and could not be more pleased with the service . <sssss> being new to the area , i got a little lost on my way . <sssss> i called the shop from my cellular telephone to ask for directions and mark was happy to guide me . <sssss> having gotten lost on the way and being a 20-something blonde girl , i worried they might not take me seriously . <sssss> take me seriously they did and take me for a ride , they did not . <sssss> they replaced my entire exhaust system in just over an hour and stayed late in order to get it done . <sssss> i think when angel gave me a time estimate , he knew that it would take them into overtime , but he took on the project all the same . <sssss> mark and angel worked beautifully as a team and i 'm so happy with the results . <sssss> not only did they give me a shiny new exhaust system , but when i asked if i could get a play-by-play of all the repairs they were doing , they were happy to oblige . <sssss> it 's a really great shop and i 'm happy i brought my car here . <sssss> any brake or muffler jobs are worth taking to mad hatter for sure . 
5		i took my onkyo tx4500mkii to be repaired and cleaned by the guys at this shop and i must say they did a stellar job . <sssss> $ 25 diagnosis fee is standard but applied to the balance of your repair . <sssss> i small price to pay to get your vintage equipment up and running ! <sssss> no hassles , quick turnaround . <sssss> perfect ! 
5		what more can be said about this classic steakhouse . <sssss> i 've been here many times over the past ten years and have never had a bad experience . <sssss> if you like prime beef , excellent service and a great dining room experience , then you have to give this place a try . <sssss> every well rated steakhouse is worth a try , but this one is my favorite ! 
5		i wish we had one of these in los angeles . <sssss> it 's the best store ever . <sssss> i always find the best designer deals here . <sssss> things i 've purchased : michael kor 's suede stilletos , stuart weitzman heels , tall egg shells boots , tall black suede boots , and tons of other goodies . <sssss> i was just thinking about how i wish they were here in la. . 
5		my wife and i had a wonderful dinner there on feb. 2nd . <sssss> the seating was immediate ; the staff was super attentive ; and , the food was excellent . <sssss> we had the salmon and tilapia dishes . <sssss> the corn cakes that came with the salmon were fantastic . <sssss> we highly recommend this neighborhood treat . 
5		wish these folks were closer to where i live . <sssss> i miss this place already ! <sssss> a seasonal poblano was available . <sssss> score ! <sssss> chock full of chicken and fruit and coddled in an almond . <sssss> white sauce . <sssss> fabulous . <sssss> we also ordered the miraculous quak . <sssss> someone in the kitchen who is quite skilled in the handling of pomeganates -lrb- i think that 's hard ! -rrb- <sssss> laced the quak with plump , fresh seeds . <sssss> great touch . <sssss> no watered down tex-mex culture here . <sssss> there are fabulous paste-ups on the windows of black & white madres . <sssss> another mural inside has the dia del muertas skulls . <sssss> small skulls encusted with sparkle are at the cash register for purchase . <sssss> it 's in a strip mall within old scottsdale , so parking can be a challenge . <sssss> walk , baby ! 
5		just a quick note to let everyone know what kind of person lee klein -lrb- owner -rrb- is ... i had seven $ 100 gift cards in my nightstand at home . <sssss> then , on jan. 15 , 2013 my home burned to the ground and i lost everything . <sssss> the other day i ate at indulge and when lee found this out he replaced all seven cards without batting an eye . <sssss> so , good food and great people . <sssss> it does not get better than that . <sssss> i strongly encourage everyone to support this restaurant . 
5		great little neighborhood bar . <sssss> i will admit it looks a lite ghetto from the outside , but the inside is surprisingly nice and clean . <sssss> they have a few pool tables and a couple of dart boards . <sssss> i 've been in a few times and the bartenders and patrons are very outgoing and conversational . <sssss> also , they have very modest drink prices , and great happy hour deals . <sssss> i 'll be back for sure ! 
5		fantastic ! <sssss> dinner and drinks for 2 were a bit pricy , but the service and food was phenominal . 
5		best gas station ever ! 
5		i 've been to this particular tutti santi a number of times and have never been disappointed by either the food or the staff . <sssss> we had our company dinner there a few months back ... 20 of us and the service was impeccable , the food unparalleled . <sssss> all of the tutti santis in the area have outstanding food , yet each of the locations has their own particular ambience . <sssss> the glendale location is elegant and the manager there has always stopped by my table to make sure all is well . <sssss> fwiw , i am a horribly critical foodie ... tutti santi never fails to pacify . 
5		i am staying here now and the holiday decor is beautiful . <sssss> this is a lovely historic hotel . <sssss> christmas trees in rows elaborate gingerbread houses . <sssss> just a great place to get into the christmas spirit . 
5		the 5 for 6 'til 7 is so awesome and such a great deal ! <sssss> i was n't sure the first time we went if we should dress up or if it was okay to wear jeans and a nice top but everyone was either in their business casual work clothes or jeans . <sssss> i would recommend getting there a little early because it fills up quickly ! <sssss> we got there at 6pm and by 7pm it was pretty full . <sssss> i have recommended this to so many of my co-workers and friends to try out and so far anyone that has gone has come back to me saying what a great time they had and how surprised they were with the 5 for 6 'til 7 deal : -rrb- 
5		after scheduling two other plumbers and being bumped on the schedule by both i found alex at alexander 's plumbing . <sssss> what a find ! <sssss> showed up the day i called , gave me a detailed description of the problem , the solution and a price for the work . <sssss> he did the work in a professional , yet personable manner . <sssss> he was careful of our stone flooring and left the work site immaculate . <sssss> my advice - need a plumber - call alex. i will . 
5		i had cake pops made for a reception on 10/22/11 . <sssss> they made 3 kinds , vanilla cheesecake , pumpkin and red velvet . <sssss> today is 10/26 and i am just finishing the last few ! <sssss> amazing that they taste just a good today as it was 4 days ago -lrb- of course i kept them in the fridge -rrb- . <sssss> we had people telling us they did n't make it home with out eating the ones they had taken for their kids ! <sssss> they took time to arrange them for me in my own baskets and added my personalized thank you tags . <sssss> the cake is sooo moist and the texture melts in your mouth . <sssss> your mouth is filled with joy and amazing flavor ! <sssss> great work guys ! <sssss> thank you !!! 
5		so glad that pizza people is open ! <sssss> the truffle mac n cheese with chicken is my favorite so far . <sssss> we ca n't get enough of the place so i feel confident we will have the entire menu sampled in no time . <sssss> pricing is so reasonable and the food is delicious ! 
5		i love this place ! <sssss> and to have it downtown now is perfect ... i do n't have to go all the way to scottsdale . <sssss> my boyfriend and i went after the gym sunday afternoon . <sssss> we were headed to matt 's breakfast , but it was packed . <sssss> i got the bufalo pizza , he got the trio -lrb- or one with lots of meat -rrb- , both perfect as usual ! <sssss> love the food here . <sssss> so far my favorite pizza in town . <sssss> there are so many downtown all a little different and thankfully with pomo here i do n't have to wait in line at bianco anymore . 
5		this place was really pricey but extremely delicious ! <sssss> i loved their stuffed mushrooms as well as their filet mignon , minus the blu cheese sauce , ew . <sssss> everything was delicious but the portions were really small and basically a bummer because you wanted more and left with a half empty stomach . <sssss> : / i would go here for possibly breakfast or brunch but nothing that you would want to be full from . <sssss> this is the kind of place that once you go here a couple hours later you 're going to drive through in-n-out . <sssss> overall it was pretty good with high prices and small servings . <sssss> would go here again if i was in the area . 
5		they hit the nail on the head at fate : the craft beer , artisan pizza , and chill atmosphere definitely make it an enjoyable place to go eat and hang out . <sssss> i recommend the capicola pizza with the pale ale . <sssss> get a flight of 5 your first time , of course . 
5		i live right down the street and have always thought tops was simply a liquor store until i opened my eyes and realized there was this awesome little bar attached to the side . <sssss> its a pretty tiny and narrow space but that definitely is part of its charm . <sssss> its simple yet comfortable . <sssss> only serves beer and wine but some really interesting and rare kinds . <sssss> my boyfriend tried the dark and orange beer and that is exactly what it tastes like . <sssss> its almost strange to have a beer taste like exactly what you would expect it to ... i am not a fan of dark beers but the flavor was so intriguing that i would order it myself next time . <sssss> they have wine and beer tasting all the time for fairly reasonable prices -lrb- that is my plan for next time -rrb- and a giant beer case in the back with all kinds of cool beers ... its like whole foods beer selection x 10 ! <sssss> ... uh there are just so many i want to try while relaxing on their comfy leather couches that i should probably go back tonight ! <sssss> : -rrb- 
5		i love this place ! <sssss> when i walked in , i was greeted with an `` aloha ! '' <sssss> all the smoothies are delicious ! <sssss> and all the baked goods are great , too . <sssss> try the apple cinnamon pecan muffin !! <sssss> yummy ! <sssss> they also have a wide selection of hawaiian coffees and treats to buy and take home . <sssss> this place is a hidden gem ! 
5		i 'm from philly and am a self appointed gnocchi connoisseur . <sssss> my i laws and i are on a life long quest to find the best gnocchi in the country . <sssss> said in laws were in gilbert last month and ate here . <sssss> the lauded the gnocchi as the best ever . <sssss> so this trip we had to try them . <sssss> they are close if not the best i 've eaten . <sssss> the vodka sauce is spectacular ! <sssss> the gnocchi are like little clouds of deliciousness ... well most of them . <sssss> the only glitch , and it is tiny but we are talking the best gnocchi in the country here , so if we find a nit we must pick it . <sssss> they needed to be stirred and cooked for a few more seconds as some were not fully cooked . <sssss> the under cooked were a little bit `` doughy '' . <sssss> all in all the are great , go there and eat them ! 
5		truly a 5 star dining experience . <sssss> the staff are knowledgeable , professional and the ambiance creates an incredible dining experience . <sssss> the food is skillfully prepared by creative professionals . <sssss> the sommelier was expert in the pairings and introductions for each of our courses . <sssss> it was truly the best culinary experience i 've ever had . 
5		wow ! <sssss> we went on 4/20/11 , and were appetizer and drink hopping around scottsdale . <sssss> on our way to dinner we came across this wonderful place . <sssss> nothing much to look at from the outside , but were pleasantly surprised , open and comfortable . <sssss> my husband and i sat at the bar , ordered a few appetizers : pork belly pastrami and crab cakes w / brussel sprout slaw ... sorry , i drifted off thinking about how outstanding and delicious they were ! <sssss> thomas our bartender who knew exactly how every dish was perpared and expaining w / such passion , we can tell he loves what he does ! <sssss> next time the reservation will be here ! <sssss> looking forward to trying everything ! <sssss> hope thomas is working ! 
5		when i lived in chicago , i felt like i was starved for good chinese food in my neighborhood . <sssss> i was close to chinatown , but could never get organized enough to be the crowds . <sssss> but in phoenix , i have flamingo palace . <sssss> and they deliver . <sssss> what is it with delivery in phoenix ? <sssss> when i 'm lazy , i want food at my door . <sssss> and i 'd like to have more than pizza as an option . <sssss> anyway . <sssss> i love their beef skewers and their moo shu pork . <sssss> their beef and broccoli is also yummy . <sssss> i 've tried lots of other things , but these are my favorite . <sssss> and i think their chicken fried rice can cure the common cold . 
5		cherry blossom noodle cafe has the authenticity of japan 's finest `` mom & pop '' eateries . <sssss> this effect is achieved by trasporting diners to a quaint interior with friendly service and delicious food the moment the enter from the low scale strip mall exterior . <sssss> the ramen with pork cutlett -lrb- chashu ramen -rrb- is superb as are many of their other asian dishes and even their italian fare is done with care and skill . <sssss> sometimes the servers are n't the best in terms of knowledge and attentiveness , but the quality of food , affordable price and friendly atmosphere make up for it . 
5		words can not describe . <sssss> seriously , these other reviews , their suggestions , those are n't lies . <sssss> go . <sssss> go now . <sssss> go often . <sssss> nothing i 've had to date can compare , that boiled fish ... oh so good . <sssss> but everything here is , i have been twice , with large groups , ordering more food than we should , and you know what ? <sssss> nothing was less than amazing . <sssss> it 's not fancy . <sssss> there really is no ambiance at all . <sssss> but guess what , that does n't matter at all when thier food is this good . 
5		i have been looking for a delicious taco place since i moved back from california in june.i 've tried a few places that friends recommended around in the valley , but they were no good.they did n't taste like authentic home made tacos . <sssss> in california , i used to eat at taco mexico all the time , so to find one out here is super exciting . <sssss> in my opinion they have the best tacos ever ! <sssss> -lrb- although , i must say i am a picky eater . -rrb- <sssss> now , they do have a few locations , i went to the one located on 16th street and mcdowell . <sssss> also , just fyi the workers all pretty much speak spanish so if your not ok with that , tough $ h!t . <sssss> you will miss out on some good mexican food ! 
5		just went here for lunch and this place rocks . <sssss> the meat was soooo good and they had some of the softest & freash fata cheese i have ever had ! 
5		classy , clean sports bar with great food and great service . <sssss> i have been here many times and was just there again this past weekend . <sssss> we had about 15 people in our party and we were seated right away . <sssss> our waitress , dalice was very friendly and did n't miss a thing . <sssss> drinks were brought out quickly and the refills just kept coming . <sssss> all the food orders came out in a decent time frame and not one person had anything bad to say about the food . <sssss> i had the buffalo chicken wrap . <sssss> the chicken was cooked perfectly and it had just the right amount of sauce on it . <sssss> i am not a sports fan so i do n't care about the tv 's and the set up but i did notice that no matter where you sat you had a view of multiple tv 's . <sssss> another great experience at blue 32 ! 
5		this place was reasonably priced , and had very good sports-bar food , along with a great selection of beers . <sssss> i went with a group of 3 , and we all enjoyed our meals . <sssss> i recommend the mediterranean gyro . <sssss> the service was well above average for a sports bar , and the food / atmosphere were better . <sssss> -lrb- we went during the ncaa championship -rrb- i will probably eat here again when i 'm back in town . 
5		an amazing meat market in chandler , az. . <sssss> they sell minnesota grown beef , pork , jerky , the best hot dogs in the u.s. and more ! <sssss> i grew up only blocks from the original market in apple valley minnesota ! <sssss> every time i walk in it reminds me of home along with the excellent customer service . <sssss> just heard that they 're opening a von hanson 's in scottsdale later this year 2013 
5		i overindulged here last night in a pretty grotesque way . <sssss> our server corey was on the ball - when we arrived these huge , delicious platters of charcuterie and cheeses and accoutrements and bread and everything else you 'd ever want were laid out on the table , along with , oh 7 different wines -lrb- there were 10 of us - do n't judge -rrb- . <sssss> imagine my surprise when the menus came around after i had already eaten my fill of meats and cheeses to the point of wanting to unbutton my pants . <sssss> i knew i did n't have it in me to officially eat anything else , so i ordered the kale and sweet potato salad -lrb- which was delicious , and which i will be eating for dinner tonight -rrb- and held my fork at the ready to steal a bite of everyone else 's food . <sssss> the chicken curry was spicy and delicious . <sssss> the fried chicken was okay , but had a weird `` undertaste '' that i could n't quite put my finger on . <sssss> the meatloaf was as good as my dad 's , and that is saying something - it was seriously delicious , and was like , mini loaf sized , so not a small portion . <sssss> the ribeye was perfection - a little crunchy on the outside from a perfect sear , perfectly medium rare , and delicious . <sssss> those pretzel bites with cheese fondue are about the size of tennis balls , so be ready for that - `` bites '' they are not . <sssss> i could n't leave that alone unfortunately ; i am a huge sucker for liquid cheese . <sssss> at this point i seriously wanted to die . <sssss> i could hardly breathe i was so full . <sssss> that is until the desserts that my sadistic dining companions ordered came out . <sssss> the monkey bread was good , the chocolate tart thingy was good , but friends - the caramel custard with caramel corn on top ? <sssss> i will dream about it . <sssss> the staff is super hip and cool , the girls are amazing looking and fantastically dressed to boot , the guy performing with his guitar was perfection , and the decor is something out of my dreams . <sssss> how do you not like this place ? 
5		my husband and i love this place . <sssss> we 've been to it in hawaii and it 's just as fresh here in chandler . <sssss> the wine list is great . <sssss> the menu changes seasonally and local chefs are allowed to change a few things around but you 're safe with absolutely anything on the menu . <sssss> except maybe the scallops which i persist in ordering even though they make my stomach crazy . <sssss> okay , granted i get the big-d with like every meal i eat but still , the food is rich and tasty and i ca n't resist . <sssss> i highly suggest trying : anything macadamia nut-encrusted shrimp pad thai waimanolo salad kalua duck spring rolls kai beef short ribs butter seared scallops butterfish blackened ahi tuna melting hot chocolate souffle etc. . <sssss> this is a great date spot , especially if you go in the cooler months where you can sit outside by the tiki torches and fire pit , listening to the traditional hawaiian music they pipe outside . <sssss> it 's dreamy . 
5		wow . <sssss> if you 're looking for a way to relax and get a lot for your money , this is an hour well spent . <sssss> kudos to my therapist . <sssss> i 'm coming back ! <sssss> affordable prices starting at about $ 30 an hour . <sssss> and right now , they are offering $ 30 for 75 minutes for a christmas special . <sssss> omg ! 
5		what a lady you are !!! <sssss> who else could charm $ 40 out of my wallet for lunch ? <sssss> totally worth it ! <sssss> i had just finished my final and decided to treat myself to a connecticut lobster roll -lrb- a roll with chunks of sustainably sourced lobster meat drizzled with warm butter -rrb- . <sssss> i went `` overboard '' and got double meat . <sssss> so delicious and this lobster trumps what you get in most restaurants . <sssss> they also have lobster mac and cheese , lobster bisque , shrimp puffs , haddock but i always go for the main event each time . <sssss> my wallet ca n't handle this all the time but whenever you want to treat yourself , look no further ! 
5		my favorite place in the valley ! <sssss> mostly because it is next door to where i live but have always had a good time here . <sssss> some people in the scottsdale/chandler area do not like it because it is not exactly the `` scottsdale '' crowd , much more laid back . <sssss> you do n't have to dress up in heels to go either , flip flops are fine on friday and saturday nights . <sssss> but if you are in heels , beware of actual sand outside . <sssss> bartenders are always friendly , just a good place to chill with friends . <sssss> also , the baja fish tacos are awesome here ! <sssss> the nachos are ok too . <sssss> they also show ufc fights each month and a fun place to watch football on the weekends . 
5		love this park ! <sssss> it has something for everyone . <sssss> i will continue to drive the distance to go to this park . 
5		can you give a pizza place 10 out of 5 stars ?! <sssss> sauce can make or break the pizza and the sauce at nellos is incredible , give me a straw !! <sssss> this is hands down , the best pizza i have ever had . <sssss> i moved to san diego 10 years ago and whenever i visit home , have to stop in . <sssss> originally started as chicago style , crust is absolutely incredible . <sssss> last time i was in they were also doing woodfired thin crust which was amazing as well . <sssss> now i have to order 2 pizzas everytime i visit , 1 thick crust and one thin crust . <sssss> they really layer on the toppings too -lrb- super high quality stuff also -rrb- hey owners - how about opening in san diego !!!! 
5		i love life and life loves me . <sssss> this breakfast house is worth it 's weight . <sssss> and if it was n't for yelp , i never would have dined here . <sssss> both of the gals i interacted with are all that . <sssss> awesome smiles with beautiful personalities . <sssss> and kiss the cook , i hope she 's a girl , because my egg sandwich was the best . <sssss> love my fity cent cup of coffee in a mug and the apple juice was a kiss sweeter than wine . <sssss> here 's to you chloe . 
5		skip the dealer !! <sssss> hands down the best spot to take your european car for all service . <sssss> my entire family takes our vehicles here . <sssss> here is why this group is the best . <sssss> 1 . <sssss> honest 2 . <sssss> best prices 3 . <sssss> amazing customer service 4 . <sssss> quality work 5 . <sssss> rental cars from hertz -lrb- hard to find with a non-dealer -rrb- they have done many things for me from oil changes to brake pad/rotor replacement . <sssss> truly won my business when audi n. scottsdale said all 4 brakes needed replacement , sun valley said only the fronts were needed now , also were $ 500 less . <sssss> it also feels good to support a small business . <sssss> give em a call , ask for barry ! 
5		the more that i frequent this place for my love of the pizza muffin , the better experiences i have had . <sssss> perhaps someone was just having a bad day ? <sssss> either way ... pizza muffins mmmmmmm ... . <sssss> . <sssss> ` nuff said . <sssss> : -rrb- 
5		delicious fish , fried okra is perfect . <sssss> very friendly and fast service . 
5		best breakfast i have ever had ! <sssss> great atmosphere as well ! <sssss> would highly recommend to all . <sssss> joined yelp just to write a review on this place ! 
5		it 's all about the food . <sssss> and the prices are great . <sssss> i get a # 3 -lrb- chicken taco , tostada , cheese enchilada , rice and beans -rrb- and a beverage for just over $ 7.00 . <sssss> there is no ambiance unless you count `` non-ambiance '' as ambiance . <sssss> you 'll be eating out of a styrofoam tray and plastic utensils while sitting in an echoing room at tables that , after the perpetual daily lunch or supper rush , may or may not be clean . <sssss> so how can this get 4.65 stars ? <sssss> -lrb- i had to round up . -rrb- <sssss> it really is all about the food . <sssss> and there is free wi-fi so you can dine and surf . <sssss> : -rrb- 
5		i 'm from dc and i 've been enjoying five guys for about 8 years . <sssss> i still think they are the best fast-food burgers in the business . 
5		i love the arcadia area for it 's amazing thrift shops and nicely hidden delicious dines . <sssss> bertha 's cafe is definitely one of those little spots where you can count on getting a quality sandwich or pastry and wash it down with a fresh batch of watermelon lemonade . <sssss> i also got a parfait there once and it was the best ! <sssss> the serving of fruit was very generous . <sssss> as for the lunch crowd you 'll see a ton of working moms and other older people there getting food . <sssss> also there is a thrift shop right next door if you have time to kill afterwards ! 
5		i am extremely happy they serve rib tips every day now . <sssss> the sauce is amazing . <sssss> get buns to soak it all up . <sssss> if you run out of buns , go to the store and buy more buns . <sssss> or you can mail me the sauce so i can dispose of it properly . <sssss> or not . <sssss> just do n't waste the sauce . 
5		it is hard for me to review an oil changing place , because there 's not much to evaluate-or is there ? <sssss> we all have to get our oil changed , and i 'm sure that everyone has been to the good , the bad , and the ugly . <sssss> i went to this jiffy lube last thursday while it was raining . <sssss> i pulled up at around 11:30 and there was no waiting . <sssss> the guys directed me in , and asked me to have a seat in the lobby . <sssss> now , all those things happen at every place , here is where this jiffy lube kicked butt . <sssss> my total time there was around 18 minutes , start to finish . <sssss> while they worked on my car , i kept waiting for the obligatory `` uhm , you need this service , and this service , and this is broke , and that is broken . '' <sssss> shockingly , that moment never came . <sssss> the only time they called me , was when it was time to check out , and pay . <sssss> the employee was required to read off the computer what services the manufacturer recommended , but after he saw my glazed over expression , he ran through all of it like a barrett jackson auctioneer , which was greatly appreciated . <sssss> at no time did they try and sell me anything . <sssss> even my air filter was ok , and they told me it 's fine . <sssss> that may seem like a simple thing , but it 's really not . <sssss> these places usually push things on you in a way that makes religious missionaries look passive . <sssss> in closing , i highly recommend this store . <sssss> the guys there were cool and laid back , and seem like they would rather have a customer for life , than screw you over once and never see you again . <sssss> well done jl ! <sssss> -lrb- that 's insider talk for jiffy lube -rrb- 
5		friday march 4th an amuse bouche , appetizer , salad , entree , and dessert and sweet for under $ 30 ? <sssss> and well prepared and well cooked and presented ? <sssss> nahhh ! <sssss> not possible right ? <sssss> wrong ! <sssss> this place is fantabulous ! <sssss> the food is prepared and served by culinary students , and the tips actually go into a scholarship fund . <sssss> the menu rotates throughout the semester , and the students are -lrb- mostly -rrb- allowed to execute recipes with their own interpretations . <sssss> it 's sometimes shockingly good . <sssss> for example , this evening one of the sweets was a lavender cookie . <sssss> do n't knock it 'til ya try it ! <sssss> it can be hard to get a reservation , so check the menu on line and try to get in ! 
5		one of the best dining experiences ... ever ! <sssss> start with a martini and oysters . <sssss> end with a chocolate martini and strawberry shortcake with fresh berries ! 
5		this is nothing short of amazing . <sssss> i 'm almost 60 years old and out of shape and limping around with back problems . <sssss> i was intrigued by the low impact aspect of the workout and the stretching benefits which i desperately needed and i had to try it . <sssss> they were patient with my skill level and very helpful . <sssss> turning upside down scared me to death but it was easy and i could n't wait to go back . <sssss> it was so helpful it actually decreased most of my back pain and i 'm walking better . <sssss> every part of my body got a gentle workout as i did the balanced lotus class . <sssss> at the same time it was challenging and i went at my own pace . <sssss> there is nothing that stretches as this does . <sssss> i love it !! 
5		warning , this place is not good for your diet . <sssss> but for your soul , it 's perfect . <sssss> great homemade cooking that is flavorful and filling . <sssss> the fried chicken is the best i 've ever had . <sssss> seriously . <sssss> the sides are wonderful , the drinks are what you 'd expect to have if sitting on a wraparound porch in the antebellum south . <sssss> the service is slow , but go expecting that , and go with cash , because they are old school and do n't accept plastic . <sssss> it may take awhile , but they 're cooking this from scratch , so enjoy looking at all of the famous autographs scrawled on the walls , joke around with your host , and be ready for a week 's worth of calories in one sitting . <sssss> you 'll surely be glad you did , shug . 
5		-lrb- lyrics - midnight oil - beds are burning -rrb- outback adventure yah ! <sssss> the flatbreads and the nacho chips breaded shrooms and skinny ritas while it 's eighty five degrees -lrb- outside -rrb- elite time 's has come to say let 's yelp to play a game to win a prize elite time 's has come elite event ! <sssss> let 's review on yelp let 's give it stars how can we dance when i should be yelping how do we sleep while i 'm busy posting how can we yelp when our drinks are flowing seems like the way is to go bo biting -- wink ! <sssss> never really thought we would ever go to a chain to do an elite event , but hey it works . <sssss> got my yummy nachos and my favorite of the night ; breaded shrooms . <sssss> needless to say , guess who had to finish it off at my table ! <sssss> did n't really care for the flatbreads , but the coconut shrimp and blooming onions help topped off the food binge night ! <sssss> drinks were awesome , i would definitely come back for the margarita mixes and the sangria was n't that bad either . <sssss> thanks again lindsey and welcome aboard jessica ! <sssss> great launch party for outback ! <sssss> -- enjoy ! 
5		loved this museum ! <sssss> great for kids ... and kids of all ages . <sssss> i 'm not sure what the definition of `` natural history '' is , but it seemed to me a little bit of everything under the arizona sun was part of this natural history museum . <sssss> never an opportunity to get bored . <sssss> the exhibits are on three levels , but with stairs , ramps and elevators , so you never are really sure which level you are on . <sssss> everything just seems to flow together - dinosaurs , mining , american indians , arizona highways , panning for gold , old jailhouse , fossils , puzzles , an old `` objects '' guessing game -lrb- i loved this ! -rrb- <sssss> , waterfalls , minerals , anthropology & archeology ... and much more . <sssss> if you have a single curious bone in your body ... you will love this opportunity to satiate some of that hunger . <sssss> there are answers here ... and lots of questions ... and you can hear the echoes of `` oh , i did n't know what ! '' <sssss> coming from those around you . <sssss> take a couple hours and go have some fun and learn a little about the natural history world around you . 
5		cheap beer , decent food , nice change of pace from all the chains around in the area . <sssss> $ 2.75 heineken , plus their buffalo fries and guinness mussels are my favorite . 
5		i found this little hot spot on yelp and used my phone to navigate me there ; i would n't have found it otherwise . <sssss> this small establishment is hidden in a neighborhood right off of historic downtown chandler . <sssss> it 's a quaint little diner with modest décor . <sssss> i felt very comfortable there and the service was fast and friendly . <sssss> as i looked over the menu the first thing i saw was the morning monte and havarti cheese as one of the ingredients . <sssss> cheddar is n't better ; it 's all about havarti folks ! <sssss> i need n't look further ; i knew that 's what i was having . <sssss> hawaiian bread french toast , bacon , turkey , egg and the havarti - absolutely delicious ! <sssss> ca n't wait to come back and bring everyone i know . 
5		great little restaurant . <sssss> family owned - i think ? <sssss> probably the best tamales i 've had . <sssss> i always try to support small and local . <sssss> you wo n't be disappointed . 
5		swag mall plus zinburger is awesome 
5		i have been here several times to eat before , and have always had a great experience . <sssss> this ihop is located off the i-10 and ray road . <sssss> for some reason , its listed as a phoenix location when i consider it awatukee . <sssss> i like this place because i have always had such wonderful service here . <sssss> the waitresses are always nice to me , i 'm always seated quickly , and i dont have to wait forever to get my food . <sssss> decent selection of food night or day , and the place is open 24 hours . <sssss> i know its considered a `` chain resturant '' but honestly , i do n't hold it against them . <sssss> sometimes , i think we could all use some comfort food -lrb- like i needed today -rrb- and i think this is a reliable place to get it without sacraficing service or price . 
5		been here four times and have never had a bad meal or experience . <sssss> the food is delicious and the portions are generouse , service has always been perfect , and the restaurant itself is beautiful . <sssss> i 've had maytag burger -lrb- blue cheese -rrb- served with spaghetti squash , wow , -lrb- i 'm not even the biggest burger fan -rrb- it was incredible . <sssss> had the grilled chicken salad for lunch one day and ate the whole , huge thing , could n't get enough of it . <sssss> highly recommend wcg ! 
5		totally love this place ... my favorite restaurant of all time !!!!!! <sssss> must have the sangria and bruschetta ... also be sure to try their home-made pesto dip made with walnuts instead of pine nuts -lrb- so good i think i could live off it -rrb- . <sssss> everything on the menu is to die for ! <sssss> they have half off bottles of wine sun-thurs and you can also get a pitcher of sangria any day -lrb- not like i need to be doing that - but its a great deal , like $ 3 a glass so how can you resist ! -rrb- 
5		a must do in phoenix . <sssss> even though the wait is like 4 hours long !!! <sssss> try the margarita and add roasted garlic ... dang i want to drive to phoenix ! 
5		a ton of great bakery options , even late in the day . <sssss> i got a giant s'mores cupcake -lrb- ~ $ 4 -rrb- , a mini red velvet cupcake with edible glitter -lrb- ~ $ 2 -rrb- , and a `` mayan latte '' -lrb- latte with cinnamon , ~ $ 4 -rrb- . <sssss> i also got to finish off my friend 's strawberry and lemon gelato and they were super fresh and refreshing after the heavy chocolate cake . <sssss> everything was delicious ! <sssss> the store/grocery part itself had a lot more gift items than food , but there was plenty of wine and beer to choose from -lrb- though at slightly higher prices than a large chain liquor store -rrb- . <sssss> tons of cute novelty things that were fun to look at before ordering dessert . <sssss> there are about three different `` locations '' inside the one room - lgo bakery , lgo grocery , a gelato shop -lrb- grateful spoon -rrb- , and then it 's connected to the pizzeria . <sssss> something for everyone ! 
5		got an old school bus but it was well worth the money had to use this as a last minute deal to las vegas the phoenix station was not too ghetto but you could tell it was not in the best area but the driver was hilarious some lady overslept and was supposed to go to bull head city wound up waking up in the vegas bus station and tried to flip out on the driver and he let her know haha but listen you got ta do what you got ta do sometime my seat was never snatched when i went to the rest room and my space was respected would suggest you take this as a last resort tho flying is wayyyy quicker ood luck 
5		yup it 's me again ... the person without the picture whos ' opinion you might not be abale to trust but i will give my opinion anyway ... after reading all the rave reviews on ... pizza pizza yelp about it ... i had to give pizza metro a try ... it was absolutely wonderful ... who knew ... certainly not me . <sssss> we made a reservation although on a tuesday not needed but we were told that it is a good idea for thursday , friday and saturday . <sssss> we took our own wine -lrb- only a $ 5.00 corking fee -rrb- ... the owner and his manager michael were very friendly and went out of their way to make sure that we were taken care . <sssss> they brought us a plate of flat bread with a mix of capers , onions , eggplant that was very yummy -lrb- sorry to you pleople that it tasted like tap water ... i have to disagree -rrb- ... we then shared a ceasar salad again more than enough for two ... we had such a hard time deciding on entrees that we wound up splitting the lasagna and a meatball pizza -lrb- not really meatballs but rather homemade sausage -rrb- ... all of it was out of this world and the lasagna was probably the best i have ever had ... the pizza was wood fired with the perfect amount of topping ... all homemade . <sssss> all in all a great dinner leaving us comfortable full but not miserable ... it will become one of our haunts and we are looking forward to trying their new restaurant `` amarone '' which we have been told will have a full bar and a larger establishment and a little more upscale ... thanks to all who wrote their reviews and made us curious enough to give it a try ... p.s. ... total bill only $ 32.00 ... and they are working on their liquor license which they hope to have in a few weeks 
5		they never disappoint ! <sssss> consistantly great , clean , friendly and healthy -lrb- ish -rrb- i do n't live close but i make the trek at least once a week because though i have searched no one does it better ! 
5		i love camelview . <sssss> not only do they show interesting movies , the employees are really nice and the theatres are very clean . <sssss> the popcorn tastes very good , and i always get a large popcorn with my mum , then bring it back next time for a free refill . <sssss> great money saver . <sssss> and the loyalty cups are totally worth the first $ 5.00 you spend , if you go to the movies a lot , like i do . <sssss> lots of old people and hipsters . <sssss> sometimes there 's snoring . <sssss> . <sssss> i think its from the hipsters . 
5		excellent !!!! 
5		had the lunch special for $ 7.95 , jerk burger and tropical salad . <sssss> the burger had an awesome flavor and a lot of bacon and thick cheese . <sssss> the salad was mixed greens , tomatoes , mango , pineapple , and watermelon in a light vinaigrette . <sssss> everything really tasty and nice people . 
5		the henry exceeded all of my hopes and dreams ... oh , the cheddar popovers ... and the caulflower polenta ... i salivate just remembering the delectable flavors . <sssss> the best haricot vert -lrb- green beans -rrb- you 'll ever have . <sssss> nevermind the secret ingredient is butter . <sssss> it 's amazing . <sssss> you 'll eat all your veggies here without a complaint . <sssss> did i mention that the cheddar popovers come with ham butter ? <sssss> it tastes like ham , melted into butter . <sssss> really , it does . <sssss> how does that even happen ? <sssss> i had a prime rib special . <sssss> not on the menu , and you are missing out . <sssss> the portion of meat was huge -lrb- 14 oz , i think ! -rrb- <sssss> and it was cooked to perfection , served with aux jus . <sssss> it was some of the best meat i think i 've ever had at a restaurant . <sssss> my boyfriend had the short rib , which either tied for deliciousness or came in a close , close , close second by a hair . <sssss> the prices are reasonable for the fantastic quality of food -lrb- plates $ 18 - 25 for the most part -rrb- and entrees include sides . <sssss> there is a good selection of interesting cocktails to choose from . <sssss> i tried their version of the moscow mule with a twist . <sssss> it was great ! <sssss> drinks are a little pricey so check the drink lists before you order . <sssss> waiters tried to upsell us on a bottle of wine that was $ 180 . <sssss> luckily , we checked the menu first ! <sssss> the ambiance is nice - it 's spacious , light and open yet the volume is comfortable and setting intimate for a nice date night out on the town . <sssss> there is a huge patio , which i 'll be excited to check out soon . <sssss> i love the casual furniture that makes it feel warm , welcoming & casual if you are just going for drinks and to lounge with friends for happy hour . <sssss> i ca n't wait to go back and explore the menu , so happy that this restaurant is in my arcadia neighborhood . <sssss> hold onto your hat chelsea 's kitchen and lgo - the henry is in town !! <sssss> this is the first fox concepts restaurant that i have given 5 stars to and will wholeheartedly recommend to anyone who asks . <sssss> go forth and enjoy !!! 
5		had some killer sushi for lunch at stingray today ! <sssss> the crunchy spicy tuna sushi is totally different than any where i have experienced it . <sssss> a well seasoned really combined tuna mixture sits atop a crispy rice rectangular tasty amazing thing ! <sssss> you must order this ... very special . <sssss> the spyder roll was super fresh and a nice big portion . <sssss> shrimp tempera roll was delicious as well . <sssss> the atmosphere was fun and the service was speedy and friendly . <sssss> there were so many choices that sounded fabulous on the menu and we look forward to going there and experiencing many more items ! 
5		the food was really good i had lamp shank with rise i tried the kebab & was really too 
5		fast service , good food and you can chose to match meat with vegetables and skip the same old side dish -lrb- potatoes , rice or pasta -rrb- . <sssss> works fine when ever i go , but for groups must be a headache . 
5		i love this place . <sssss> i wish i could move into chelsea 's kitchen and never leave . <sssss> first of all the service is outstanding . <sssss> things usually go perfect , but if they do n't you really get a sense of how a restaurant should be run . <sssss> i take all out of town guest here and always end up getting a ton of praise for my dinner recommendations . <sssss> i have people beg me to overnight them the red velvet cake . <sssss> the nachitos are so simple , but done to perfection . <sssss> if all of the `` best things i 've ever tasted '' menu is n't enough , they out do themselves with those delicious little cookies they offer you when you leave . <sssss> try it , you 'll like it . <sssss> there 's a party in my tummy , so yummy ! 
5		i 've lived in phoenix for almost 10 years and always received gasps when admitting i 'd never seen zoo lights . <sssss> i went for the first time this past sunday evening and was blown away ! <sssss> they do a fantastic job of converting the phoenix zoo into a magical , visual wonderland . <sssss> the trees are lit with moving lights , many in the shapes of different animals . <sssss> if you look carefully , you can even see some of the real animals too . <sssss> there is music , sound effects and different interactive elements like a polar slide and camel rides ! <sssss> my gf and i enjoyed ourselves , but not as much as my little niece and nephews who could n't get enough of it all . <sssss> this is definitely a great experience for families and anyone who wants to try something cool and unique during the phoenix winter season . <sssss> november 22 , 2012 - january 6 , 2013 -lrb- 6 - 10 p.m. -rrb- 
5		great service . <sssss> tasty food . <sssss> good place for friends to gather . 
5		tried this place for the first time yesterday . <sssss> friendly techs and they did an excellent job . <sssss> the pedi actually included a hot rock massage of my calves and feet . <sssss> they use heated lotion for the hand massage . <sssss> all for $ 32 . <sssss> ca n't beat that and i will be back ! 
5		okay , so i have to admit , i 'd addicted to picazzo 's ! <sssss> where else can you go when you 're gluten free , living in phoenix and absolutely love , and i do mean love , italian . <sssss> one mouthwatering word : picazzo 's . <sssss> they get it right from the texture of the gf pizza crust to the taste to the million toppings you can concoct on it . <sssss> also , they have a plethora of other goodies such as spinach and artichoke dip , mama 's meatballs and the perfect pesto pasta dish . <sssss> the regular foods not too bad either i hear , i 'll take my boyfriends word on it . 
5		i 'm from the east coast and love rita 's ! <sssss> imagine my sheer delight when i stumbled upon this location ! <sssss> i walked in and the place is clean , colorful , and made me nostalgic for my youth ! <sssss> you ca n't help but smile . <sssss> was greeted warmly by friendly smiling faces :-rrb- i chatted with the owner for a bit and turns out she is from the same area as my family back east ! <sssss> small world ! <sssss> they let me pretty much sample everything since i have n't been to a rita 's in a long time . <sssss> it was awesome . <sssss> lots has changed or maybe the west coast chains are different . <sssss> the cantaloupe has fresh bits of cantaloupe in it . <sssss> the sugar free mango peach was so good . <sssss> i was hesitant to try the creme flavors - cheesecake and oatmeal raisin - i did n't like the cheesecake so much , tasted too artificial , but the oatmeal raisin was -lrb- surprisingly -rrb- delicious ! <sssss> i was disappointed they did n't have my favorite flavor - swedish fish - but they said they rotate flavors and will probably have it in soon . <sssss> i 'm so happy there is a rita 's so close ! <sssss> what a wonderful surprise today ! 
5		fresh , reasonable , nice staff and ambiance . 
5		i 've been to a number of nhl arenas and amongst the `` new school '' of nhl arenas this is undoubtedly one of the best ; it is a shame that not enough people show up for the games to appreciate it . <sssss> starting first with the location - essentially in the midst of a large shopping and entertainment complex - there is no shortage of people watching and things to do before and after the game . <sssss> next add in the free parking , another huge perk for someone not a stranger to spending $ 20 to park a car in detroit . <sssss> entering the arena everything is clean and well maintained while the ice surface is kept in pristine condition by cooling the entire building to arctic levels almost as if to avoid any criticism of playing a cold weather sport in the valley of the sun . <sssss> seating is comfortable and the sight lines are pristine while the open view of the surface from the upperdeck is innovative and a nearly `` bowl '' like experience unlike any other . <sssss> dear phoenix , there is a good chance i 'll be moving to your city , please find a local buyer for the damned team so i have an excuse to come here more often . <sssss> you 'll never be my favorite team , but i 'll contribute to a season tickets package and cheer for you anytime you 're not playing the kings . 
5		first of all , my best friend and i came here on sunday when there were floods in scottsdale so we thought , `` holy hell we have to eat outside . '' <sssss> the wait was about 20 minutes , but very worth it . <sssss> i had to use the process of elimination to choose my breakfast because all the options were to freakin ' die for . <sssss> i decided the get `` the bird '' which is an omelet with turkey , avocado , mushrooms and boursin cheese . <sssss> the plate also came with delicious potatoes and fresh fruit . <sssss> the portions were huuuuge so i 'm glad i did n't cave and get the side of pancakes too . <sssss> ouch , that would 've been painful . <sssss> overall , the service was great , the food was greater and the stormy weather made it all so much better . <sssss> this is definitely a place to try at least once ! 
5		the body shops products are absolutely the best products i have ever used . <sssss> all of them . <sssss> the makeup is of really good quality and does not cause any skin problems for me at all . <sssss> the body butters are my favorite , they smell so good you 'd think you could eat them -lrb- actually you can , they are all natural ! -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> i have tried almost all of the skin care lines and i have not been disappointed once . <sssss> they have a rewards card , that i believe does cost money , however , there are ways around it if you spend enough money in there , i have never paid for a renewal or the card itself in the beginning . <sssss> every time i go into the store to buy something i always walk out with something free . <sssss> either because i 've reached a certain amount of points on my rewards card , or because they throw some samples in my bag . <sssss> it may seem a little expensive , but it is definitely worth every penny . <sssss> some of the proceeds go to good causes as well ! 
5		love this place . <sssss> well-made food , great atmosphere . <sssss> the avocado and heart of palm salad is possibly my favorite thing on the menu -lrb- with the exception of their nutella banana empanada -rrb- . <sssss> their gallo pinto is even tastier than the versions i had in costa rica . <sssss> this is an absolute must-try in mesa . 
5		i worked with chad from mr. b 's moonwalk for my kids ' birthday party last weekend . <sssss> from start to finish , i received nothing but the utmost professionalism and personal service . <sssss> you can tell he really enjoys the service he provides to families and makes an extra effort to make sure his customer is satisfied with their service . <sssss> i ordered a castle bounce house , along with tables and chairs for our party at the park . <sssss> he was prompt , the bouncer was clean , and it made it really easy to be able to have them deliver tables and chairs too . <sssss> this was the 2nd time we have used mr. b 's and this experience was even better than the first 2 years ago . <sssss> i will definitely use them next time i need a bounce house ! 
5		definitely a must-try ! <sssss> the building itself is n't much to look at but the parking lot is always full and that 's a great indication of yummy-ness . <sssss> it caters to both meat and veggie eaters with fake chicken , duck , and beef plates . <sssss> they also have mock seafood plates as well . <sssss> my friend and i went to check this place out because we had heard so much about it . <sssss> she ordered the lemon grass chicken and i tried the ginger duck . <sssss> both were so tasty and we were kinda freaked out because they tasted just like the real thing . <sssss> the service was excellent and kudos for the waitress who kept filling up our waters ... even after we paid the bill . <sssss> it 's reasonably priced and the food portions are perfect . <sssss> we even had leftovers . 
5		we received a large box of these delicious brownies from my husband 's client . <sssss> they are everything the packaging claims . <sssss> thank you ! <sssss> we will enjoy trying all the wonderful flavors ; favorite so far are the espresso and the cream cheese . <sssss> we will be sending boxes to our loved ones this holiday . <sssss> what a great find ! <sssss> who does n't love a delicious brownie ? 
5		we 've been coming here for over 10 years . <sssss> i grew up in europe where the asian restaurants are far more authentic . <sssss> golden gate is about as good as it gets in phoenix . <sssss> it 's small and intimate , the service is fast and friendly , the food is amazing , the prices are remarkably low , and it is privately owned and operated . <sssss> you ca n't beat it ! 
5		shutterbox came and helped us make our community easter eggstravaganza and big hit !! <sssss> everyone loved having them there and the pictures were so adorable . <sssss> the perfect addition to any gathering . <sssss> they are so easy and fun to work with . 
5		have been many times . <sssss> i have always been very satisfied with food and service . <sssss> last nights takeout was simply amazing . 
5		yummy !!! <sssss> this was my first time trying forefathers and definitely wo n't be my last . <sssss> i ordered the regular steak philly with cheese whiz and although i will now have to up my workout tomorrow , it was worth it . <sssss> i loved that the sides were available to add as you like -lrb- the peppers -rrb- . <sssss> . <sssss> great idea . <sssss> i also loved the sweet potato fries with fry sauce . <sssss> love , love , love . <sssss> thanks tony ! <sssss> great place you have here . 
5		so we decided to have a neighborhood boys golf weekend - the `` hall of foam group '' checked in on friday , and checked out on sunday - what a blast ! <sssss> the place was unreal and completely affordable for anyone ! <sssss> let 's go through each of the following : hotel front desk check-in was a breeze . <sssss> the lady at the front desk quickly and efficiently had our group checked in within minutes of arriving . <sssss> the woman was very friendly and knowledgeable . <sssss> we were off to our room in the tower to drop off our coolers and clothes , while leaving out clubs down at the golf course area . <sssss> hotel room we stayed in the tower rooms - all rooms overlook the sports complex and the first hole of the golf course . <sssss> the view was awesome from the 5th floor that we were on - there was a nice sized balcony with a table and chairs that we could hang out on early in the morning when the sun came up . <sssss> the rooms were clean , modern , and way above average . <sssss> the bathrooms were huge and the tile work immaculate . <sssss> there was a big flat screen tv in the hutch , but we did n't watch too much tv that weekend . <sssss> golf course having never golfed at francisco grande , i had no idea what to expect - the clubhouse had everything you needed - balls , tees , and clothes . <sssss> we gave the golf pro our paper voucher , and out to the carts we went . <sssss> the carts were very modern , and fast for electric carts . <sssss> the course was awesome . <sssss> many very cool holes , including # 3 and # 8 that you had to hit over water . <sssss> the course was challenging , but not difficult for the average golfers . <sssss> our group had a great time - we were able to split into several groups and play different types of scrambles throughout the course , all while cooling off to several cool beverages from the personable beer cart lady , donna rae . <sssss> donna made the group comfortable on the course while getting us cool towels , staying on top of our beer situation , and just throwing in her two sense worth on our golf shots . <sssss> all in all , the golf course gets huge thumbs up . <sssss> duke 's lounge here was the kicker . <sssss> the duke 's lounge . <sssss> this is where we loaded up on beers before we went out on the course , and had a few before we played . <sssss> the lounge was first class in a very elegant setting . <sssss> many different beers on tap , along with a ton of different bottles to choose from . <sssss> but it was the food that sent us over the top . <sssss> on the friday night we were there , i had the all-you-can-eat fish fry . <sssss> originally being from wisconsin , your fish fry had better be pretty good to meet my standards . <sssss> this was one of the best fish fry 's i have ever had . <sssss> the food was hot , fresh , tasty , and affordable . <sssss> i would make the 1 hour drive again , just to have the fish fry . <sssss> my buddies had the prime rib , another had the ribs , and others had the fish fry too . <sssss> all reviews were the food was excellent . <sssss> the bartenders were on top of their game , getting food and drinks out to us , while attending to our needs . <sssss> the maintenance guy even turned the pool lights to the grass area by the lounge , so we could play corn hole after dinner . <sssss> we also had vouchers for the morning breakfast , which was way above average . <sssss> we had breakfast out on the patio - the service was great , and the food and menu very impressive . <sssss> so what was the downfall of this place ? <sssss> there was none . <sssss> it was the perfect stay . <sssss> we do n't want to tell anyone else about this place , so we will have the same service and accommodations next year . <sssss> the customer service at the francisco grande was , and is , outstanding ! <sssss> i did not receive this type of service at expensive 4 and 5 start phoenix resorts we have stayed and golfed at in the past . <sssss> will we come back to this hidden gem ? <sssss> you bet we will . <sssss> sure it is off the beating path in casa grande , but that is ok . <sssss> we did n't experience any `` smells '' , there was no traffic , and our stay was perfect - thank you francisco grande - we will be back ! 
5		this is by far one of my most favorite restaurants . <sssss> their ahi tuna appetizer is better than most sushi restaurants , the service is always great . <sssss> i think they have the best hamburger and fries in town . <sssss> however , i love their ribs . 
5		how have i lived here all my life and never heard of this place until last week ?! <sssss> we tried this place with a group of friends who had been here before . <sssss> when they described the menu , i had a hard time imagining anything other than the english version of a calzone . <sssss> i could n't have been more wrong ! <sssss> from the laid back and hipster atmosphere to the jalapeno `` chips '' and attentive but not intrusive server , i love this place ! 
5		oh jeeze . <sssss> aj 's is one dangerous place for me ... no way would i ever do my weekly grocery shopping here - far too expensive ! <sssss> i love cooking , entertaining and hospitality . <sssss> when i 'm having my family or friends over for dinner or a party , i 'll pull out all of the stops and do some of my shopping here . <sssss> superb wine and beer selection and everything else in between that you could possibly need to be an excellent host . <sssss> if you 're thinking about hitting up `` yuppie lunch hour '' , just do it ! <sssss> i work nearby , and a lot of us will come here frequently for lunch . <sssss> excellent soup and salad bar , and the sushi is always pretty fresh . <sssss> happy hour is from 2-4 ... daily ! <sssss> and you ca n't beat $ 1.51 for a ginormous iced tea - suck on that , starbucks ! <sssss> blackberry sage tastes great . <sssss> too bad it 's only available saturday . <sssss> great place to get your coffee fix as well . <sssss> ** update 6/11 : reusable iced tea and coffee tumblers are back - 75 cent refills on iced tea and brewed coffee daily ! <sssss> $ 10.99 . <sssss> hurry if you want one ; these babies go fast ... been meaning to get one since february ! <sssss> ** at the end of the day , you get what you pay for , and aj 's exceeds expectations in terms of quality . 
5		amazing food and i 'm a vegetarian ! <sssss> their pizza , appetizers , and sandwiches are great . <sssss> good brews too ! <sssss> my only complaint is that it is really loud and pretty pricey . <sssss> i tried to go there for a late lunch -lrb- around 2 or 3pm -rrb- with a friend one day and they would n't let her in since she was n't 21 . <sssss> i thought that turning away business at that time of day was kind of strange . 
5		i just got married here and it was truly the most beautiful wedding i have ever been to . <sssss> okay , i 'm a little bit biased , but sooo what !! <sssss> honestly breathtaking , peaceful , serene . <sssss> dianna at the park was a huge help ! <sssss> i had access to the quaint little tea house to get dressed . <sssss> my photographer got some beautiful photos in that house and all over the park - there are photo ops around every corner ! <sssss> i also had access to a private little garden in the back so i was hidden from my guests before the ceremony began . <sssss> my guests continue to gush how beautiful it was and how perfect the garden was for our wedding . <sssss> i have had several guests tell me this is now their number one suggestion for family/friends looking for ceremony locations . <sssss> the garden houses a large koi pond , 10-foot waterfall , grassy knolls , beautiful trees , bushes , flowers , tea house - all unique things that you would n't expect to see in or near downtown . <sssss> things to note : the park offers fish food -lrb- for a cost -rrb- to feed the koi . <sssss> the park offers brochures to give yourself or group a self-guided tour . <sssss> the park offers tea ceremonies -lrb- for a cost -rrb- once a month . <sssss> http://phoenixpd.org/parks/jfg.html 
5		i love the balkan bakery ! <sssss> easily the best bread products in phoenix , produced on site every morning - so get in there early before they are sold out . <sssss> they are also now offering morning - lunchtime foods and sit in tables . 
5		favorite lunch spot . <sssss> love to come here and watch the planes take off ! 
5		this is the thinnest crispiest crust i have ever seen and they serve it with a fork and knife . <sssss> i love it ! 
5		wonderful ! <sssss> after driving by bink 's for months and wishing i was seated at the patio , i was finally able to stop in and enjoy . <sssss> you have to valet , so make sure you have some cash on hand . <sssss> seating is simple and comfortable - the restaurant is cozy , rustic , and the outdoor patios are shaded nicely with large umbrellas and trees . <sssss> started with a couple baby back ribs and an order of fries . <sssss> baby back ribs were messy , yummy , good . <sssss> fries were great - i loved the aioli and truffle ketchup . <sssss> accompanying vert sauce was good , too . <sssss> bacon burger was great . <sssss> my husband asked for medium , and it was cooked perfectly . <sssss> he does n't like pickles at all but the mix of caramelized onion mayo , onion roll , and cheddar balanced perfectly with lucy 's spicy pickles . <sssss> it was rich without being greasy and heavy . <sssss> chicken salad sandwich was also very good - the perfect lunch sandwich . <sssss> the onion roll is wonderful , and the chicken salad is hearty without being too heavily weighed down with mayonnaise . <sssss> we both got a salad on the side - so wonderful . <sssss> it 's a bowl of mixed green that 's incredibly earthy and simple . <sssss> you can tell all the ingredients are local - they shine with freshness and quality . <sssss> i think prices are reasonable for what you get . <sssss> i did come in with the expectation that i was going to have a decadent , heavy meal . <sssss> i think what we ordered did n't give us that , but i was in no way disappointed . <sssss> when you take a good look at the quality and preparation of food at bink 's , it 's hard to be disappointed . <sssss> service was good - our waitress was helpful , knowledgeable , and prompt . <sssss> i am excited to go back ! 
5		pizza by napoli how i love thee . <sssss> this is how i would picture a little mom and pop shop in the big city back east . <sssss> everyone speaking in thick italian accents and the type of people you would love to have as friends . <sssss> i always order the large meatball pie and my friends , it fuggin rules . <sssss> thin slices of what you know are a great italian grandmas recipe passed on for generations . <sssss> great mild sauce and thin and crispy crust . <sssss> this is in my top 5 pizza joints in az falling only to nellos . <sssss> the dine in experience is a must , old school booths , old school arcade games , sports on the tv . <sssss> it reminds me of a time before the 30 minutes or its free delivery craze . <sssss> when people would sit down and enjoy a pie right out of the oven . <sssss> even the high chairs are old school and full of metal . <sssss> if you call in take out , remember your assigned number given on the phone . <sssss> they 'll love you for it . <sssss> in closing , napoli kicks arse frenz ... ... ... ... 
5		two places i go to almost 2-3 times a week they add right next door to each other . <sssss> one place serves traditional japanese style ramen , this ramen is really good , i mean really good . <sssss> so good they only serve a limited amount of bowls !!!! <sssss> 30-40 bowls and once they 're out they 're out ... fresh noodles , fresh meats , and fresh veggies all in one bowl . <sssss> and the broth oh my gosh the broth !!! <sssss> flavorful and tasty . <sssss> it 's all located in a small japanese market family owned . <sssss> i also do some of my shopping there when i have time . <sssss> they have japanese candy and other good snacks , japanese beer , saki and wine as well . <sssss> they pretty much have it all if you know what to look for from japanese mayonnaise to fresh horse radish . <sssss> they even have natto which is a fermented japanese soy bean that smells and taste like feet but is so good for you , it is an acquired taste . <sssss> the place next door is a japanese bakery , they serve great sweets , cakes , pies , shakes oh my . <sssss> and fresh bread baked daily . <sssss> speaking of the bread they serve some of the best japanese sandwiches i 've ever tasted . <sssss> the beef sukiyaki is my meal of choice , they also have matcha cakes which is really hard to find in arizona they fact that they make this blows my mind . <sssss> and the owners are so kind , so polite and so friendly i only wish i found this place out sooner . 
5		did n't think there was too much to say about a fast food restaurant but recently after i left the drive thru i realized they fave me the wrong drink . <sssss> when i called the # on my receipt , it went to a call center and she wanted to send me a certificate for free burger , fries and a drink for my inconvenience . <sssss> then a week later , i actually got a call to make sure i got my certificate ! <sssss> now that 's great customer service ! 
5		i 've gone to sakana for 12 years . <sssss> when my friends or family come in from seattle , it 's where we have sushi . <sssss> i can honestly say that i remember once or twice having something i did n't care for . <sssss> once or twice in 12 years is not a bad record . <sssss> i think sometimes we have bad experiences and that 's probably what happened to the two reviewers that hated the place because i 've been referring sushi lovers to sakana for a decade and no one has ever said they were n't impressed . <sssss> actually , my nephew once said that he preferred sushi 101 on university because their nigiri were smaller and fit into your mouth better . <sssss> what kind of american is that ? <sssss> the portions at sakana are pretty big , he does have a point ... but i 'm all about maximizing my buck and the quality has never disappointed . <sssss> try the salmon -lrb- not smoked -rrb- and the yellowtail nigiri . <sssss> melts in your mouth . 
5		talk of the town - asian diner they have my favorite orange chicken and i think that their service is always awesome . <sssss> so i 'll give them the extra star because it seems great service these days is harder to find than great food - not to mention at a great little neighborhood location . <sssss> the owner always says hello and will make custom orders if asked . <sssss> it is one of my favorite lunch spots as the food is always made fresh , fast and friendly - which are my 3 keys for a great lunch . <sssss> i have also had great experiences when i have called ahead to pick up food . <sssss> i like to get the dinner size for lunch turn it into two meals . 
5		let me preface this review with a disclaimer . <sssss> this is not ` normal ' mexican food . <sssss> if you want tacos , beans , rice , chips and salsa , go elsewhere . <sssss> if you want cheap , go elsewhere . <sssss> if you want ` authentic ' sonoran mexican food , go elsewhere . <sssss> but ... if you want a very flavorful food experience that has a mexican ` foundation ' in a unique and trendy environment , and you 're willing to spend a few extra bucks , i think you would enjoy this place . <sssss> ok , that said , here is my -lsb- gringo -rsb- review ... wow . <sssss> went here for a late lunch on a thursday . <sssss> i had the black mole chicken enchiladas . <sssss> others had the seafood enchiladas and enchiladas suizas . <sssss> all three dishes were excellent . <sssss> we also had the chocolate cake on ice cream with strawberries for dessert . <sssss> it was wonderful . <sssss> i must admit , the table next to us had the churros , which looked even better ! <sssss> i am a sauce person . <sssss> i rate mexican restaurants by the flavor of the sauces . <sssss> on that basis , i can wholeheartedly give the barrio cafe 5 stars . <sssss> interestingly , the complimentary starter dish presented was not chips and salsa , but rather bread and tapenade , which was a nice departure . <sssss> the tapenade was yummy , although i am also a big fan of fresh chips and house salsa -lrb- again , if it has a good flavor and constitution ! -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> on top of the fine food , the restaurant is decorated wonderfully with el dia de los muertos artwork . <sssss> even the restroom is a kick . <sssss> their ` throne room ' is a true shrine ! <sssss> lol . <sssss> i loved it ! <sssss> i will definitely go back when we are in phoenix and recommend you give it a try . <sssss> i understand it gets quite busy at times , so i can recommend a thursday at 2:00 pm as a great time to stop by for a late lunch and avoid the crowds . <sssss> salud ! 
5		perfect early thai dinner ... spicy musscles ... tad pad with shrimp and chicken , perfect fit for a early dinner. , no rush crowd here if you arrive a week night early dinner good food , great price ! 
5		new owner , no more mean lady ! <sssss> i boycotted this place because of the previous owner , but back to give new owner business ! <sssss> good soft chewy boba , yummy drinks , good customer service ! <sssss> got the fresh watermelon slush and thai tea slush - 2 for 2 ... score !!! 
5		this is the best pho in town . <sssss> we 've been coming here for years and have not been disappointed even one time . <sssss> tao and the other servers are always nice and timely . <sssss> excellent pho tai ... spring rolls are amazing ! 
5		amazing , been twice and would go every week if i lived downtown . <sssss> the food is incredible , the environment is chill , and the proprietors are super friendly . <sssss> it 's only open sun.-tuesday and will close for good 4th of july . <sssss> go while you can !! 
5		i went here for my birthday . <sssss> my girlfriend called ahaed and asked them to have two glasses of wine waiting for us at the table . <sssss> as for the food ... delectable . <sssss> the brussels sprouts appetizer is absolutely the perfect combination of flavors . <sssss> i also found out why everyone raves about the shortribs . <sssss> i made the mistake of ordering the beef bourginon shepards pie , it had three little chunks of stewed meat inside . <sssss> it made me sad and yearn for my dates plate of `` fork tender shortribs '' . <sssss> theres no need for a knife . <sssss> i could eat that every night for the rest of my life . <sssss> also while im at it , i must tell you about these chocolate covered bacon smores dessert . <sssss> holy cow . <sssss> definitly worth saving room for . <sssss> the servers were all so friendly , willing to escort patrons safely through the crowded dining room . <sssss> i really enjoyed my experience here , and will definitly be coming back . 
5		great hotel ... excellent amenities ... good snacks at breakfast and dinner ... great location ... excellent customer service 
5		was here multiple times and had a great experience , best american/chinese place in phoenix . <sssss> tried multiple items on menu , and never disappointed 
5		you ca n't be r-bar on a beautiful arizona night -lrb- not the hot kind , the beautiful spring and fall kind -rrb- . <sssss> the camelback inn recently modeled this place and wow ! <sssss> its absolutely gorgeous and everything you want . <sssss> lots of space , plenty of oversized furniture , fire pits , twinkle lights , water features and live music all against the background of the mountains . <sssss> you 'll pay for it with cocktails averaging $ 14 , but its so worth it . <sssss> my husband and i -lrb- late 20s -rrb- love coming here for a nightcap after dinner . <sssss> we just sit and listen to the live music and enjoy the beautiful arizona nights . <sssss> we love walking through the property and sitting in the secluded adirondack chairs and enjoying our drinks . <sssss> it does n't get better than this on a nice night . <sssss> we were hesitant to try - thought it would be an older , stuffy crowd but its not at all . <sssss> its very laid back with the music of visitors/guests and locals . 
5		for mother 's day , my daughter took me to see legally blonde the musical here . <sssss> i had never been to a small local theater and i had my doubts . <sssss> well ... those were completely wrong ! <sssss> it was great . <sssss> so good that we already bought tickets to their next show , rocky horror show . <sssss> small , intimate setting with a really high caliber performance . <sssss> we were very pleased and had a great time . <sssss> and the cost ... dirt cheap for what you get ! <sssss> it is almost the same as a night at the movie theater and this is live ! <sssss> very happy to have found this local gem and ca n't wait to go back . 
5		these are great baseball/softball fields ! <sssss> i 'm not a city of peoria resident and i do n't visit this park for anything other than my son playing youth baseball - both in club baseball and district little league tournaments . <sssss> the rio vista baseball/softball fields are some of the nicest , best maintained fields in the valley . <sssss> it 's obvious the city cares about this park and their sports programs . <sssss> the grass is always green , cut and simply wonderful . <sssss> the infields are well maintained , well striped and watered , with one exception - the pitching mound on field # 7 has deteriorated to the point of being a pitching bump . <sssss> as of june 2011 it 's far from the 12 '' height required for little league play . <sssss> that being said , it 's still a nice grass infield to play on . <sssss> i 've had the opportunity to work with the staff at rio vista park too , just to communicate baseball scores during district 2 little league tournaments . <sssss> the staff is a joy to work with . <sssss> thanks for a wonderful place for the kids to play baseball ! 
5		love their hamburgers , both regular ones and vege burgers . <sssss> the staff , particularly at the bar , are great . <sssss> -lrb- tom and al -rrb- . <sssss> the wine selection is good . <sssss> appetizers i love include the spinach artichoke dip and the grilled artichokes . <sssss> yum ! 
5		if i could only eat one type of food for the rest of my life , it would be pizza . <sssss> and if i could only go to one pizza place in phoenix , it would have to be mamma mia 's . <sssss> everything about their pizza is perfect . <sssss> sauce . <sssss> cheese . <sssss> size . <sssss> crust . <sssss> price . <sssss> all perfect . <sssss> and i 'm not a huge wing person because i do n't like fried food , but i am pretty sure mamma mia 's wings are baked and they are delicious . <sssss> and the customer service is amazing . <sssss> last time i was in there , they threw in a free 2-liter bottle of soda for free . <sssss> pizzeria bianco , you ai n't got shit on my mamma mia 's . 
5		i 'm on a mission to find good mexican food in az. . <sssss> i 'm not talking about sonoran or fresh mex . <sssss> the mission is probably the best restaurant i 've been to in az !!! <sssss> the outside of the restaurant reminds me of the alamo in san antonio , tx . <sssss> we had the skirt steak street tacos , street corn , crab and corn pancakes , and the banana and blueberry pancakes . <sssss> it was brunch on a sunday of course ! <sssss> all the food was superb ! <sssss> skirt streak came in 3 small tacos , but was very filling . <sssss> skirt steak itself was so tender and not chewy ! <sssss> crab and corn pancakes reminded us of the crab salad at zinc bistro and find out later both are owned by the same person ! <sssss> win win ! <sssss> lots of fresh crab on top of corn pancakes ! <sssss> the street corn was amazing !!! <sssss> we asked the server to cut it off the husk and it was made with some sort of sauce that had a huge kick !!! <sssss> it was crunchy and sweet and then spicy from the sauce ! <sssss> my husband and i still can not stop thinking about it !! <sssss> i have no idea what was in that sauce ! <sssss> the children had banana and blueberry pancakes ! <sssss> so yummy ! <sssss> the bananas were fried and caramelized ! <sssss> this place rocks and it is so affordable !! <sssss> we ca n't wait to go back ! 
5		one of the best places to spa in the valley . <sssss> my favorite place . <sssss> the staff make your time there , a time of peace and r & r. 
5		thinking about one of these burgers is making me wish i didnt live in chicago . <sssss> they are so tasty it should be against the law . <sssss> the place has such a great feel with the fire pits , animals , and live music . <sssss> it is one of those places that you can go for the burger and hang out all night just enjoying the atmosphere and roasting marshmallows . <sssss> it is definitely one of my `` must go to '' places when i vacation to arizona . <sssss> i wonder if my dollar is still hanging from the ceiling ? 
5		my boyfriend and i went here for dinner last night and absolutely loved it . <sssss> the food is extremely fresh , tasty , and the options are various and interesting . <sssss> our server recommended that we try their fresh squeezed juices and we each ordered them , one being called the hangover . <sssss> very yummy and if you want , you can add alcohol to them . <sssss> our server was great , explaining the menu and the vision behind true food and everything they make . <sssss> its for the most part local and organic food and you feel good eating it ! <sssss> there 's an italian side to it and an asian side to it , we did both and were very satisfied ! <sssss> i highly recommend the turkey bolognese and mediterranean salad . 
5		stoner hoagie ... need i say more . <sssss> the hippies got it right for sure ! <sssss> this sandwich is off the charts deliciousness . <sssss> you ever order something and think , oh i 'll just eat it in the car ... not really an option here ... i had to pull over . <sssss> and every morsel was a delight . <sssss> i could n't quite decide if the toasted buttery roll was my favorite or wait maybe the feta cheese atop the mouth watering carne asada or the pesto mayo . <sssss> . <sssss> or perhaps all of it . <sssss> i chose the potato salad for my side , and i 'm ever so fortunate that i did . <sssss> they rock it ... the bacon bits are just a super added bonus !! <sssss> this sandwich is ***** and then some ! 
5		we were lucky enough to have chad little come out and get to work . <sssss> this is n't a padded review . <sssss> . <sssss> i do n't know these guys . <sssss> . <sssss> and do n't post a ton of reviews . <sssss> . <sssss> in fact this might be my first . <sssss> being from the east coast ... i 've got this thing about scorpions . <sssss> for whatever reason i think of them like burglars ... because if you 've ever had someone break into your house you 'll know that it jacks up your comfort from then on . <sssss> . <sssss> for a while . <sssss> same with me and the scorps . <sssss> so these guys had a nice web site . <sssss> . <sssss> i gave them points for their playful business name ... and they seemed to have everything i needed in terms of services . <sssss> chad came out . <sssss> . <sssss> for a blacklight service . <sssss> . <sssss> where they hunt the little jerks with a blacklight ... and make them go away . <sssss> scheduled for 8:30 he called me at 7:30 hoping to come and get started on treating the place . <sssss> my questions was `` wo n't that scare them all off and not let you catch them all when it does get dark '' he answers . <sssss> . <sssss> no actually its better this way because the pesticides make them uncomfortable where they lay and even if they were n't in the mood to come out and play , they would be now . <sssss> he talked about using 5 different pesticides . <sssss> . <sssss> time released and from what i know about laying chemicals he did everything right . <sssss> he found a couple dead scorpions . <sssss> . <sssss> a couple of black widows . <sssss> . <sssss> and then in the final hour -lrb- big property -rrb- he found one alive and kept it in a glass collection jar . <sssss> he came and showed it to me , like it was no big deal and his body language towards the things taught me that my nervousness about them and around them is n't all that warranted . <sssss> he collects them -lrb- in a non creepy/nerdy way ; thinks their bad ass looking etc -rrb- all things said and done , he gave me tonsss of insider trader info on how to keep them away in the future with bug lights , and why and when they 'd stick around . <sssss> i think a couple hundred bux for peace of mind and more importantly , being able to view scorpions in a different way . <sssss> . <sssss> not as malicious pests but as bad ass little independent creatures just trying to survive , is well well worth it . <sssss> critter ridders , confirmed a bunch , gave a nice invoice at the time of the service , a digital copy after . <sssss> they are excellent and i will be using them for monthly treatments moving forward . 
5		you just ca n't go wrong with anything on the menu . <sssss> the 7353 club is definitely my favorite , but every other meal i 've seen or tried has been to die for . <sssss> the atmosphere alone is worthy of 5 stars . <sssss> i wish it was easier to get to ... but that is the beauty of this diamond in the rough . 
5		there are so many good things about ko 's ... i do n't know where to start ! <sssss> first , the food is excellent and reasonably priced . <sssss> the service is great , too ! <sssss> when i go in , i feel like the waitresses and bartenders have been my friend for ages . <sssss> robbie is my go-to bartender , and recently was served by a girl angela who was so great ! <sssss> a couple reviews down someone talked about getting bad service and i feel like they have no idea what they are talking about . <sssss> i 've had bad service before , but never ever at ko 's ! 
5		the thai place in the area . <sssss> i really enjoy the general feel of the place , the staff is very friendly and the remodeled facade makes it appear much classier . <sssss> the color and lighting are a nice balance of light and dark , giving the restaurant a comfortable , private aura without appearing cramped or dim . <sssss> while the dress code is casual , i 'd feel perfectly comfortable coming here on somewhat dressy occasions . <sssss> i 've eaten here many times and have never disliked the food . <sssss> portions are generous while prices are low . <sssss> unlike many other places i 've been to , medium here actually is moderately spicy instead of `` just short of our absolute spiciest '' . <sssss> the meat is always delicious whatever form you 're eating it in , and the curries are spectacular . <sssss> do n't forget to get some thai iced tea with your food ! 
5		i was blown away by the ahi burger . <sssss> as a pescabacatarian -lrb- fish , veggies , bacon -rrb- i did n't think i would find anything here to eat . <sssss> when i saw the ahi on the menu i decided to give it a try . <sssss> it was perfectly cooked , the bun was great and it was n't heavy or too filling . <sssss> i 've heard good things about the fries and shakes so i 'll be going back for sure . 
5		i love papa murphy 's ! <sssss> love the fresh ingredients , love the super friendly people who work there , love the pizza ! <sssss> you ca n't beat the price of their pizza - yes you do have to take it home and cook it . <sssss> it 's as easy as turning on the oven . <sssss> and you get fresh , delicious pizza at a great price . <sssss> they always have coupons available , and the coupons never expire . <sssss> i also love their cookie dough . <sssss> the cinnamon wheel is ok . <sssss> my favorite pizzas - perfect , veggie , and chicken and bacon stuffed . <sssss> i think i eat at papa murphy 's once a week . <sssss> hooray for great pizza ! 
5		random , but really cool ! <sssss> great place to take the kids and keep the whole family entertained . <sssss> good place to take out-of-town visitors too . <sssss> had the bbq chicken pizza which was delicious . <sssss> will definitely be back again . 
5		holy yum , i could eat here every day . <sssss> randomly went here last week for the first time and it was love-at-first-bite . <sssss> this restaurant is authentic family-style , there are photos of the family on the walls and under the glass table tops . <sssss> the service was amazing ; our server was one of the sons and he never stopped smiling . <sssss> we tried the stuffed shells , the eggplant parmigiana and the caesar salad . <sssss> it was all delicious . <sssss> the caesar dressing had a hint of olive oil , the eggplant parmigiana was thick and tender and the stuffed shells are now absolutely my favorite thing ever . <sssss> there 's no bar , but you can bring your own bottle of wine and they will serve you without a corking fee . <sssss> note for the owners : your joint is amazing . <sssss> i love the traditional , down-to-earth feel but it could really benefit from the convenience of a credit card machine . <sssss> i wanted to take my boyfriend here this weekend but we did n't have cash on us . <sssss> please , please start taking credit/debit cards . 
5		hi - hubby and i are trying to find new places to eat . <sssss> we recently checked out this place and loved it . <sssss> arriving late evening we were n't looking to be shocked . <sssss> found out they have otb and i really liked the ambiance . <sssss> the dining room had cool tables set up for late night intimate dinners or fun evenings of shots and pool . <sssss> the menu was great , lots of dining options and all sorts of specials . <sssss> our server ryan was so nice , helping us make our final decision having the fish and chips and their specialty ` penne pesto pasta . <sssss> they both were so delicious , the fish was crispy and cooked just right , and the ` signature dish ' was full of flavor and easy on the eyes . <sssss> the manager mike came by and made sure we were happy.we were . 
5		my new diet plan requires i eat like a hyena on the serrengetti . <sssss> meat . <sssss> and lots of it . <sssss> one teensy problem . <sssss> i do n't like meat . <sssss> but then i also do n't like the idea of my looking like an old man poolside this summer , my swimsuit hiked up to my nips . <sssss> for this reason , i choose tj 's as part of a sensible weight loss plan . <sssss> in the frozen food section , you can get a 360 calorie portion of lamb vindaloo for a few bucks and voila , banana hammock , here we come . <sssss> with any luck , i should be down to a svelte 250 in no time . <sssss> or , i suppose i could always get a metric scale , where i 'd trim down to 115 overnight . <sssss> nah , go get the lamb vindaloo . 
5		i 've been getting manicures and pedicures for years with suzanne - the nail goddess . <sssss> she truly lives up to that name and does a flawless job every time . <sssss> suzanne is fastidious and takes her time to make sure every nail turns out perfectly . <sssss> her technique also helps nail color last weeks , which i really appreciate . <sssss> i 'm suzanne 's loyal customer for life ! 
5		delicious ! <sssss> came all the way from cali to try it ! <sssss> i thought it was going to be cheesy an over the top but it was excellent and i even meet the owner . 
5		one warning ... $ 225 per round on weekend at prime season . <sssss> the course is worth every penny too ... why ? <sssss> it 's one of the most manicured courses in the state , it 's got some of the best designed holes in the southwest , phil 's grill , and some of the best looking cart girls i have ever met . <sssss> there are two courses raptor and talon ... both are hard but talon , i like a little better for the higher handicapper than raptor . <sssss> at my prime , i was a 8 hadicap when i played these courses ... i shot 81 at talon and 98 on raptor during the weekend . <sssss> talon i think has more memorable holes ... 3 sisters , devils drink , box canyon , etc. . <sssss> the clubhouse is amazing , the location is perfect , and the course is as close to being a member you can get without paying monthly dues and a large retainer . <sssss> if u think $ 225 is too high to play golf ... i think that you will miss out on one of the premier golf courses in the nation , and you should splurge once in a while because this is the course to splurge on . <sssss> if you have a junior ... ask about junior play because juniors used to be able to play free and they give the youngings a hat for free as well ... but check with this because this may have changed since i played there a few years ago . 
5		this place rocks for value !! <sssss> . <sssss> i just had a california sub and it was fantastic ! <sssss> extra sweet coleslaw with pastrami stuffed in a fresh yogi roll . <sssss> i really reccomend this one . <sssss> this place is kinda tucked away behind churches chicken but way worth the trip . <sssss> they even have exotic sodas in bottles including real dr pepper . <sssss> you should try it sometime . <sssss> best of all they now have pepsi in the fountain drink . <sssss> a perfect compliment to an awsome sandwich . <sssss> if your on a budget and want to get stuffed come here you wo n't be dissapointed ! 
5		yesterday i saw the actors theatre production of `` a christmas carol . '' <sssss> for me , it 's just not christmas without at least one viewing of the dickens classic , and this version was so good and so satisfying that i may actually forgo my beloved george c. scott this year . <sssss> fezziwig teaches at the same school i do , and told me about the discounted tickets available . <sssss> even at the regular price ranging from $ 20 for children 16 and under to $ 47.50 for adult tickets , this production is worth every penny . <sssss> i was amazed by the quality of the special effects , impressed by the comedic timing , and found myself misty eyed at the end , having fully invested in the actors ' performances . <sssss> even the kids were great , especially the little girl who played fan -lrb- what a voice ! -rrb- <sssss> and the adorable kindergartner who played tiny tim -lrb- he is also `` half day '' in the subway commercial -rrb- . <sssss> and in spite of the fact that i am one of those soulless people who despises most musicals , i found myself tapping my toes along with the songs . <sssss> i do n't want to ruin the surprises by giving too many details , but i urge you to get your tickets today . <sssss> this is a show not to be missed ! 
5		i love that this place gives you free samples , because i would have never ordered the creamed corn otherwise . <sssss> . <sssss> and man was that stuff the bombschizzle ! <sssss> i ca n't wait to go back and get more ! <sssss> we also had the lean brisket , spicy chopped brisket , and beans . <sssss> . <sssss> and it was absolutely deeelicious ! <sssss> we finished our perfect meal with the largest softest rice crispy treats . <sssss> . <sssss> yummy ! <sssss> now it 's food-coma time ! 
5		what is wrong with me ? <sssss> why am i reviewing a dry cleaner on yelp ? <sssss> because they are good , friendly , fast and affordable . 
5		holy cow i love this place . <sssss> this is my favorite resort . <sssss> the staff is friendly and the grounds are beautiful . <sssss> i highly recommend this place . 
5		i frequent this subway quite often . <sssss> sam and wilson are always professional and beyond friendly . <sssss> sam has even learned what sub and cookies i always get . <sssss> great place . 
5		came here with a restaurant.com coupon , so worth it!we started off with delicious barbecue sliders , i had the cajun combination of chicken jambalaya , chicken and sausage gumbo and an amazing crawfish andouille . <sssss> my boyfriend tried the catfish po-boy and we finished it off with a bourbon sundae . <sssss> the food was delicious , the service was great and they had decent live music . <sssss> i will be going back soon ! 
5		housed in an old storefront along gilbert road near the watertower , the farmhouse delivers the best breakfast for miles around . <sssss> the cinnamon bun - wow . <sssss> best ever . <sssss> the green chile chicken omelot is stunningly tasty . <sssss> the all veg omelot - wonderful . <sssss> the oj is fresh squeezed , the coffee is excellent and the link sausages are like mom used to make long ago . <sssss> a classic place for breakfast and worth the drive to gilbert - highly recommended and the best place for breakfast in the valley . <sssss> / we 're still looking for a better place and have n't found it in arizona . 
5		what a hidden gem !! <sssss> i 've lived in tempe nearly six years and ca n't believe i 've never been to spinato 's before . <sssss> tucked into the industrial part of tempe , it 's hard to miss but you will want to make the trip . <sssss> after getting my wisdom teeth out all i wanted was pizza and this place was a great choice to be re-introduced to the world of solid foods 
5		this place has great food quality and the serving sizes are ginormous . <sssss> we got the $ 40 family combo plate and took home enough for another full meal . <sssss> the combos are a great way to sample all they have to offer . <sssss> everything was good , with the stand-outs being the falafel and the kafka . 
5		seriously the best food in town . <sssss> the chicken shwarma is amazing and the portion is huge . <sssss> they also have the best hummus i 've ever had . <sssss> the owner and wait staff are helpful and the service is quick . <sssss> princess is a must try ! 
5		took my daughter and her friend out to cnc and they had a blast ! <sssss> the staff was great and the lines were n't long at all . 
5		went here the other day for lunch and it was excellent . <sssss> both i and my friend had different pizzas at lunch and we were both very impressed . <sssss> i 'll definitely be back to try out the rest of the menu . <sssss> the service was very good as well . <sssss> the only negative to the place is the seating is very cramped and it 's pretty small in general . <sssss> not a huge fan of almost knocking elbows with the people at the tables next to me . <sssss> the food and service are outstanding and make up for it however . 
5		i love this place and was so sad when they closed down . <sssss> from what i know they are about to open their new location . <sssss> i do n't know when , but it 's located on southern and mcclintock . 
5		ahmazing ! <sssss> we are lucky to have this pizzeria in phoenix . 
5		lived up to all the hype ! <sssss> great service , great beer and great food ! <sssss> go with the pretzel bun and sweet potato tots ... did n't have room for dessert but i hear good things ! <sssss> medium style wings were a hit ! <sssss> my only suggestion is to serve the wings with celery instead of carrots . <sssss> that 's just my preference but everyone 's different . 
5		this was a superb experience - everything about it - the food and the service ! <sssss> what a treat and worth every penny ! <sssss> i was visiting from dc and read about the restaurant so the concierge at the fairmont made me a reservation for 1 . <sssss> i had a flank steak dish that was so tender with a margarita that was the best i ever had . <sssss> the manager is edison - what a star - its not every day that you get such star treatment as a single lady traveler !!! 
5		i 'll keep this short and sweet , but shields is fantastic and will now be my go to biz when i need an electrician ! <sssss> very professional , reasonably priced -lrb- $ 75 to hang a chandelier -rrb- , on time and in and out as quick as can be ! <sssss> thanks for being so trustworthy ! 
5		for quite a while now i 've driven past a residential building in old town scottsdale , at the base of which is an unassuming red and white sign that reads `` posh improvisational cuisine . '' <sssss> after having asked several friends what this place was all about and gathering random bits of information about this mysterious restaurant that `` has no menu , '' `` is really expensive , ' and my personal favorite `` i have no freaking idea , '' i added it to my list of places i wanted to try out . <sssss> recently i had the opportunity to meet several friends for dinner and posh was the consensus restaurant choice , so to posh i went ! <sssss> arriving first in my group is unusual for me but arrive first i did . <sssss> the `` lobby '' in posh is well . <sssss> . <sssss> posh , with several comfy chairs and a view of what 's going on in the restaurant . <sssss> after a few minutes my group arrived and we were shown to our preferred counter seats -lrb- the better to see chef joshua hebert create our dinner -rrb- , brought cocktails and given the rundown on how things worked . <sssss> presented with sushi style menus , we were instructed to strike through any proteins that we did n't like and note at the bottom any allergies or things we did n't prefer to eat . <sssss> that was it , a menu would be created individually for each diner in the party by the chef and his crew of culinary mad scientists . <sssss> i ordered the six course tasting menu sans wine pairing for $ 65 , and wondered what gastronomical delights awaited . <sssss> my wait was not long as the amuse bouche arrived in short order . <sssss> after a few minutes our first course arrived , potato viscosuisse with chive oil & arugula pesto , a surprisingly lite , chilled soup with a silky texture that begs to be consumed . <sssss> all conversation stopped as the members of my party hungrily consumed a variety of tailor made dishes and just as suddenly resumed amidst a chorus of `` oooh 's , ' and `` ahhh 's , '' while we discussed the day 's events and waited for the next course which in my case was an heirloom yellow tomato sorbet , sweetened with a little bit of simple syrup , mint oil & tomato caviar garnish . <sssss> i must say , i never knew tomatoes could taste so exquisite . <sssss> the flavor was bright , sweet and fresh with just a hint of acidity and was topped with tiny red tomato caviar which burst on the palate providing just the slightest bit of sourness . <sssss> on to the next course of santa barbara spot prawns served with a shrimp demi-glace , preserved lemon , capers & baby artichokes . <sssss> now i 've eaten a lot of shrimp in my time and more than my fair share of prawns yet i 've never had them cooked so perfectly . <sssss> the temperature was spot on making them succulent and moist , the rich and flavorful demi-glace tasted faintly of the ocean and combined with salty capers had me envisioning waves of flavor washing over my palate . <sssss> while awaiting the next course we discussed the different experiences each member of the group had had to this point . <sssss> there was general agreement that there were flavors , textures and presentation elements that we had n't had previously and all were eager to move on to the next course which was fois gras . <sssss> i 've always heard people waxing poetic about the virtues of foie gras and have generally been ambivalent but no more , the crunchy brulee ' was the perfect textural compliment to soft , slightly sweet foie gras -lrb- the texture and flavor of which i 'm still at a loss to adequately describe -rrb- , served over a sweet coulis of papaya with tiny house pickled grapes and topped with a beautiful garnish of hand spun sugar . <sssss> i 've thought about this dish many times over the last few days but the only thing i 'm able to say is that you must try it ! <sssss> my next course was lamb which i normally find improperly prepared leaving it with an unpleasant taste and texture but masterfully prepared here . <sssss> served with broccoli , fingerling potatoes & a mustard dill sauce with chile flakes . <sssss> unfortunately , i wolfed it down so fast that i forgot to take pictures . <sssss> i will say that having lamb prepared in this way gives me cause to add it to my list of `` likes ! '' <sssss> the next course happened to be duck , another protein that i typically dislike due to poor preparation which leaves it greasy with an unpleasant flavor . <sssss> here the duck was bacon cured served with bok choy & apricot sake sauce . <sssss> this dish was both visually appealing and absolutely delicious -lrb- i 've said this about several of the night 's items with good reason -rrb- , it was perfectly prepared , tender enough to cut with a fork , with just the right amount of salty smokiness which went well when paired with the accompanying apricot sake sauce . <sssss> following the duck was a surprise course of scrapple -lrb- a pennsylvania dutch favorite -rrb- , served with fava beans and the boar bacon that i 've heard so much about . <sssss> this crunchy on the outside , soft and creamy on the inside staple of the pennsylvania working man was elevated by chef joshua hebert , to something extraordinary . <sssss> topped with a crispy poached egg yolk , crunchy boar bacon bits and bright , fresh fava beans , scrapple at posh is one of my new favorite thing . 
5		chipped beef on toast , corned beef hash , biscuits and gravy and eggs maximillion all excellent ! 
5		i have enjoyed these tacos every time i see their cart at events in scottsdale and phoenix . <sssss> i love the chicken taco with the roasted chili sauce . <sssss> yummy . <sssss> carte blanche was my favorite at the devoured event at the phoenix art museum . 
5		we have all been either dragged to the mall , or been the one who has dragged someone with them . <sssss> well if you find yourself being dragged to pv mall make an escape to the brookstone store if you can . <sssss> this store has everything you need to walk out feeling amazing . <sssss> massage chairs and tools of every kind , which are out and ready to be tested by you ! <sssss> i think the main idea of this store is items which will make you life more tolerable . <sssss> do n't pay $ 2.00 for someone to massage you in the mall . <sssss> trust me just come here ! 
5		quiet , secluded , elegant , old spanish , luxurious . <sssss> excellent restaurant and lounge with live music . <sssss> beautiful pool with cafe . <sssss> fantastic service at every level . <sssss> perfect getaway . <sssss> five star hotel , but some real bargain prices available during july and august when it 's inconceivably hot -lrb- temperatures were 110-ish on the weekend i was there -rrb- . 
5		the best filibertos , and i 've eaten at them all as well as the * berto clones . <sssss> the meat never tastes like cat unlike at some of them and it 's open 24 hours , inside too ! <sssss> the condiment bar is always stocked with fresh peppers , tomatoes , salsa , guacamole , etc and they actually get my orders right first try . <sssss> if you do go late you may encounter a line at the drive through because it 's a hoppin place after everything else closes . 
5		i can not believe this is fry 's ! <sssss> i remember what it looked like years ago , old and gritty . <sssss> i have n't been in this store in years , until this week . <sssss> the remodel looks amazing ! <sssss> as soon as you walk in , there are a ton of flowers and plants to welcome you . <sssss> to the right , are the shopping carts , to the left ... a real cold stone ice cream shop ! <sssss> the entire store looks so much better . <sssss> there 's even a walk in wine section , sit down wine area . <sssss> this is now my grocery store . <sssss> love that i 'm just a 5 min drive ! 
5		this is pretty much my favorite place to shop for very specific kitchen gadgets or cook ware -lrb- yes , they 're better than williamss because they have a ton of variety -rrb- . <sssss> yes , it is pricey if you 're buying the big name brands , but the gadgets are priced competitively and they always have a great and well-stocked ` clearance ' section in the case you want to grab some great deals . <sssss> their baking tools are varied and they carry a lot of sizes -lrb- from huge to tiny -rrb- for your baking and decorating needs . <sssss> their slt white porcelain is moderately priced -lrb- though world market may be cheaper some times -rrb- . <sssss> their staff here is helpful and not pestering . <sssss> . <sssss> there have been very few times that i 've not found what i wanted or needed for our house/kitchen or for a gift . <sssss> . <sssss> i like getting their catalog because you can find great cooking courses -lrb- at the keirland location , though -rrb- and they occasionally send you $ 10 off coupons ! 
5		if you want the best non sit-down restaurant burger ever , then this is where you go . <sssss> i am absolutely head over heels in love with smashburger . <sssss> i was completely smitten when i first visited the one in tempe a while ago , but the long distance relationship was just too much . <sssss> now that smashburger is closer to my ` hood , we can see each other more often . <sssss> we went for their vip grand opening , and everything went surprisingly well ! <sssss> they were utterly jam-packed but the crowd was appeased with shake samples while we waited for our free food . <sssss> of course it was delicious . <sssss> you ca n't go wrong with the bbq bacon burger . <sssss> we have since been quite a few times , and they are consistent with the first . <sssss> i always get a delicious burger that is cooked well but still incredibly juicy . <sssss> the bacon actually adds to the burger in both texture and flavor . <sssss> the haystack onions really set this burger apart from the rest though . <sssss> they add flavor , texture , and a perfect savory finish to every bite . <sssss> i love the veggie fries , especially when i get lots of asparagus . <sssss> the olive oil rosemary fries have actually gotten better since the opening . <sssss> i think they have lightened up on the oo , which is a good idea . <sssss> smashburger is pretty tight with me , although my pants do n't appreciate it . <sssss> we 'll have to see where our relationship goes once smashburger moves in less than a mile from my house . <sssss> i hope i do n't get too clingy . 
5		postinos on the east side !? <sssss> whoa , you like to think that you 're immune to postinos , oh yeah it 's closer to the truth to say i ca n't get enough you know i 'm gon na have to face it , i 'm addicted to postinos thanks robert palmer and let 's just say i would n't be surprised to see the fashion models around here . <sssss> very attractive crowd ! <sssss> i am honor just to be here ! <sssss> another bottle of wine and you 'll be mine , a one track mind i ca n't be saved 4 flavors of bruschetta is all i crave if there 's some left for you and do n't mind if i do i might as well face it i 'm addicted to postinos i 've always enjoyed attending postinos on the west side of town , but the east side adds a new flavor . <sssss> the place still has a great deal on monday and tuesday nights . <sssss> bottle of wine plus a large plate of bruschetta 's for $ 20 ! <sssss> the ambience is always chill and low lighting . <sssss> quite romantic and add some pretty ladies and i 'm golden here ! <sssss> service is always great at postinos . <sssss> the staff is definitely well train in the knowledge of wine and their service is spectacular ! <sssss> - enjoy !

5		i read their reviews and the 4.5 star average immediately intrigued me . <sssss> it takes a lot to earn a 4.5 / 5 star average on yelp and it made me wonder , it made me ponder and it made me eager to visit immediately to see what all this burger hype was about . <sssss> while planning an office hours at lobby 's , i spoke to lobby several times and listened to him explain the attention he gives to his burgers . <sssss> the incredibly lean meat , the personal attention to each patty , lobby 's commitment to making the patty 's from scratch ... it sounded like this was a business that was definitely handled with some tender loving care . <sssss> so the day arrived for me to finally visit lobby 's . <sssss> the directions indicated that it was in a strip mall . <sssss> for those of you who might get a little turned around like i do ... go towards the grocery store and when you 're facing it look to the left and behind you and poof , there 's lobby 's ! <sssss> so i walked in and received a friendly welcome from the staff the second my foot entered the store . <sssss> as i sat there for several hours , i noticed that lobby and staff treat every customer the same way and each customer gets a personal welcome upon arrival . <sssss> i also like how they welcome but they do n't banter the potential customers to try the food . <sssss> they let the customer decide for themselves . <sssss> the decor was retro and cool and i could see the burger and fries being made right in front of me . <sssss> i glanced at the menu even though i knew that only a burger this visit would do , and i was pleased with the price . <sssss> inexpensive . <sssss> moving on to the grand finale , the food . <sssss> i ordered the cheeseburger and upon the staffer 's recommendation , i got it with provolone and kept everything on it , especially lobby 's special sauce . <sssss> the staffer suggested i take some special sauce on the side for my fries and swore by it so i did n't question the man and said ok ! <sssss> the burger and fries arrived and i immediately knew i was in trouble ... the gluttony kind . <sssss> nestled on a fresh sesame bun and topped with thick and juicy pickles , lettuce , tomato and the special sauce , the patty was cooked to perfection and just the right size . <sssss> i took one bite and was in cheeseburger paradise and i did n't even have to go to hawaii ! <sssss> the burger was juicy , full of taste and the meat was lean . <sssss> the special sauce . <sssss> oh my the special sauce . <sssss> it 's not your typical special burger sauce . <sssss> there was an ingredient in there that made it just the right amount of sweet and perfect for dipping fries . <sssss> i guess the lesson here is trust the lobby 's staffer ! <sssss> i tried to guess what the ingredients in the special sauce were but lobby said that nobody has ever been able to guess . <sssss> so that 's a challenge yelpers . <sssss> figure out what 's in the special sauce and let me know ! <sssss> the fries were crunchy and delicious , but there were a lot of them so if you go with a friend , you might want to share the fries since the burger will fill you up . <sssss> i ca n't wait to visit lobby 's again and try the italian beef sandwich donald s was raving about . <sssss> if it 's anything like the burger , i know i 'll be in heaven . <sssss> but in the meantime , i 'll just have burgerlicious dreams about the tastiness i experienced with lobby 's burgers . <sssss> and now i see why they have such a high rating on yelp . <sssss> bravo lobby ! 
5		such amazing food ! <sssss> one of my favorite places now 
5		fantastic service . <sssss> they know you on a first name basis , always ask about your life and know what you 've talked about in the past , and the hygenist is pleasant and professional . <sssss> they take my insurance , which is rare , and give 110 % to every client . <sssss> i live in downtown phoenix and still travel all the way to chandler every 6 mo for a cleaning . <sssss> also , dr. steiner is pretty cute . <sssss> -lrb- what ?! <sssss> it 's a honest review ! -rrb- 
5		i love fresh & easy !! <sssss> i would rather come here 10 times in a day than go to the big box stores 1 time ! <sssss> staff is great , they make it easy to get in and out and they always have great deals and the quality of food is great ! <sssss> love the new york strip steak with peppercorn sauce !!! 
5		this place has everything you could be looking for ! <sssss> good for a date or just with the buds ! <sssss> the food takes the spotlight at the mission . <sssss> its not over priced and it fills you up ! <sssss> fancy by my standards , however , all of the tacos were delicious and the tostadas were amazing !!! <sssss> get the table side guac to spice everything up ! <sssss> just remember what you order comes usually in threes and there are no sides per say . <sssss> margs are 10 $ a pop but they are good ! <sssss> atmosphere and service was amazing ! 
5		my husband and i have had the pleasure of working w/trini when we first got engaged . <sssss> due to our wedding budget , we were certainly skeptical of hiring a wedding planner ; however , we can both confidently say that trini was worth so much more than what we paid ! <sssss> the one important aspect of my wedding was originality . <sssss> we both wanted a wedding that was different form your typical hotel wedding . <sssss> everything from our hand-painted wedding invites , to our unique floral table-clothes , trini 's creative ideas certainly came to life . <sssss> another important aspect of trini 's involvement in our wedding was her prompt response time . <sssss> being the stressed out and anxious bride that i was , trini promptly answered every emai/text/phone call i ever placed ! <sssss> and although i am sure she could have been extremely annoyed w/me , she always assured me that she had everything under control . <sssss> if you are having a wedding , party , baby shower , etc. , i assure you that you will be nothing less than pleased w/trini 's services :-rrb- thanks again trini ! <sssss> i am going to miss talking to you every day :-rrb- melissa and humberto paramo 
5		fantastic service , friendly staff , reasonable prices , always available and very organized . <sssss> other car places will tell you that your flux capacitor is on the fritz or in order to reverse the polarity of the neutron flow , we 'll need to do all this that and the other and it 'll cost a small fortune . <sssss> no funny business here . <sssss> i am blessed with a good quality service across the street from my home . <sssss> thanks wilhelm automotive . <sssss> ps . <sssss> free wifi while you wait , transportation , coffee , two convenient stores next door and a tasty pizza place across the street . <sssss> first review ever and this place deserves it . <sssss> thanks 
5		the food was absolutely delicious . <sssss> was very surprised in finding a good asian restaurant here in phoenix . <sssss> we had the papaya salad with soft shell crab , phnom penh noodle soup , and the lehong noodles . <sssss> all were delicious and very se asian . <sssss> i could not believe how great the food was . <sssss> but the best part was the grass jelly drink - it brought me back to my childhood . <sssss> ca n't wait to try the other dishes here . <sssss> a definite must try here in phoenix . 
5		provably the best place in town . <sssss> best ambiance best cuisine best service cleanliness : 10 
5		i was staying at the resort for a meeting , and when i found out that such a unique restaurant was here , i had to try it . <sssss> and luckily , my close friend had traveled with me , so together we shared an incredible meal here . <sssss> the menus were printed on a menu with beautiful native american art - we ordered the 5-course tasting menu . <sssss> the menu showcases local ingredients and the waiter told us that the chef tries to incorporate the history of the local tribes into the food . <sssss> i do n't recall everything that we ate , i do recall a lobster dish , as well as a filet of bison . <sssss> yum ! <sssss> for dessert , to my joy , was souffle ! <sssss> souffle is my favorite , and this came with a warm gooey sauce to top it off . <sssss> a special mention that the cocktails were very good , i had a couple of martinis that were phenomenal . <sssss> would definitely come back . <sssss> if i lived locally , this would definitely be a special occasion place , as it is pricey . 
5		attentive , humane attention . <sssss> my son 's knees were hurting him something awful . <sssss> he listened carefully to his symptoms , observed him walking , and found the perfect solution shoes . <sssss> thanks ! 
5		as with the other chipotles i 've been to , it was great ! <sssss> came here for lunch in between baseball games at the padres fields at the sports complex . <sssss> got my standard burrito bowl with chicken . <sssss> i love the rice . <sssss> that cilantro lime rice just makes the bowl . <sssss> and the meat is always fresh and just great . <sssss> this chipotles was very generous with all their ingredients and it made for a great lunch on a hot day ! <sssss> we also bought one of our friends a burrito . <sssss> he had never been to a chipotle , and really enjoyed it . <sssss> we may have made a new fan for chipotle ... 
5		my go to spot for lunch dates with coworkers ! <sssss> i am in love with their chicken walnut sandwich and the blue cheese crumble salad . <sssss> this specific location gets really busy around 12 so try lunch at 11 or 1 :-rrb- the staff is pretty friendly and helpful . <sssss> i always get worried at the beginning of the line that i wo n't get a table but the staff here are pretty quick at clean up so there 's always one available . 
5		i live right around the corner and have never noticed this place since you ca n't even see the sign driving by it . <sssss> but if you drive by very slowly you can see the sign by the street telling you what they have in this strip mall and it just says `` coffee '' for this place . <sssss> i ordered going bananas which is apparently their specialty drink and oh man ~ tastes exactly like chocolate covered bananas and it is delicious ! <sssss> the best part of that experience is how friendly the guy who works there is . <sssss> i 'm not too sure if he 's the boss or not , but he was very helpful and super nice ! <sssss> there are also a few games like checker that you can play there . <sssss> and i love the seating arrangement since you can have your individual table for laptop use then there 's this super comfy sofa , i was so surprised when i sat down and sunk into it : -rrb- 
5		tiramisu ummm !! <sssss> great new business in old town scottsdale . <sssss> unique flavors !!!! 
5		if you love hair bows and have been having to make them or order them over the net ... you 've met your match ! <sssss> bows in every size , shape , color and style ... it 's the bow mecca ! <sssss> if you have little girls or if you are a big girl who loves to do fun hair styles with bows basically bows is a must see ! <sssss> they are n't too expensive but if you go crazy it can add up ! 
5		if you 're a vegetarian , you already know about this place . <sssss> if you 're looking to take a vegetarian somewhere -- this place is a sure spot . <sssss> best veggie/vegan cuisine i 've ever had . 
5		close , convenient , clean , and cheap . <sssss> the four cs get five stars . 
5		absolutely delicious . <sssss> quality materials , phenomenal flavors - everything to love . <sssss> it has a nice mom & pop feel despite being in a strip shopping center in scottsdale . <sssss> it 's hard to decide between the beef noodle dish with eggrolls and the sandwiches - so i rarely choose - i just get both and take it home . <sssss> this is the kind of place where you order extra to have for later ! 
5		one tip , show up right at 11 , or you might as well wait to eat till 1:00 . <sssss> this place is packed , and it is packed for a reason . <sssss> amazing food . <sssss> i have been here a few times now and felt that it is time to give a review . <sssss> i am big on going to a place at least three times unless the first time was just horrible . <sssss> by far the best pad thai with chicken i have ever had . <sssss> there is just the right amount of food . <sssss> not to little , and not to much . <sssss> the chicken was cooked just perfect . <sssss> make sure to get a thai tea , no matter what . <sssss> you may or may not like it on the first sip , and it takes a few sips to get used to the flavor , but it is delicious . <sssss> -lrb- tastes nothing like regular tea -rrb- if you are in the mood for curry , then you cant go wrong with the red or yellow curry , both make my mouth water just thinking of them . <sssss> this place is a little slow on getting the orders out , but , it is because it is so busy that you cant really complain . <sssss> just be patient if it is taking a little longer than normal because the food is well worth the wait . 
5		this elegant restaurant is located in the w hotel and its entrance was a bit hard to find at first , but just go into the valet area and the door is right there . <sssss> my bf and i came here for dinner on a friday night and it was amazing ! <sssss> our server was very helpful and efficient . <sssss> she was on top of things and gave wonderful recommendations . <sssss> the restaurant manager even came out to make sure that we had everything we needed and that we were enjoying our meal . <sssss> really classy , seriously , their sushi was some of the freshest i had ever had ! <sssss> we had an assortment of sashimi . <sssss> the grilled salmon was my favorite . <sssss> it came with mashed potatoes and hijiki seaweed . <sssss> the creme brulee was to die for ! <sssss> the perfectly torched sugar gave a nice sticky crunchy bite to the creamy filling which was adorned with mixed berries . <sssss> it was a pack of sweetness and tartness . <sssss> truly , a wonderful way to finish off an incredible dinner . 
5		stopped in for a first visit here today , ordered , & claimed a comfortable booth . <sssss> for this second visit to any smashburger , i ordered a 1/2 lb . <sssss> bbq bacon & cheeseburger -lrb- $ 6.99 -rrb- , & smashfries -lrb- $ 1.99 -rrb- . <sssss> like the store on baseline in tempe , this one was immaculately clean & had staff members who were perky & eager to please . <sssss> pretty soon my order arrived . <sssss> this burger comes with meat , bacon , cheese , & a little stack of crispy deep-fried onions , & you add your own ketchup & mustard -lrb- both heinz , of course ! -rrb- <sssss> , & your own salt & pepper . <sssss> with real metal tableware available to help manage eating this feast , both the hamburger & the fries were terrific . <sssss> the special `` smashfries '' tasted like good pizza . <sssss> i really love this place ! <sssss> :--rrb- -rrb- 
5		fourth time here at this place , and i 'm going with a winner . <sssss> i gauge every mexican place here in the valley off of their machaca chimis , and this one has scored each time . <sssss> unlike the `` other '' ones here in the arrowhead ranch area , this one delivers a crisp outer layer -lrb- guac and sour cream -rrb- with moist meat inside . <sssss> the spice is a bit much at time , and they could add some cheese to the inside , but comparability , this one is the best in the area . <sssss> the fam has had the quesadillas without complaints , and the service is top notch . <sssss> although it 's order and sit , you get real plates and real silverware , and a few hd televisions to watch while you eat . <sssss> the owner may be a bit finicky picking things off your table while you 're conversing with someone , but i guess it 's better than being ignored . <sssss> the salsa bar is fresh , and the chips were okay , but at times the cashier forgets to give them to you . <sssss> i chalk these up to new opening jitters , and as long as the quality stays , i 'll be a regular . <sssss> ambiance and politeness is much better than the surrounding ` others ' you 'll have to deal with here in arrowhead ranch . 
5		this was my first experience with lush -lrb- with many more to follow -rrb- . <sssss> i stumbled into the store because i could smell it 4 stores down , and i was drawn in by the aroma -lrb- i do n't even thing i read the name on the sign ... i just followed my nose -rrb- . <sssss> i had never seen anything like it ! <sssss> the giant blocks of soap , the colorful bath-bombs , the bubble bars -lrb- that looked like little cakes -rrb- , and so much more ! <sssss> it was late december , so the sales staff told me that any left-over christmas items were buy 1 get 2 free -lrb- what a deal on my first visit ! -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> they demonstrated a bath bomb for me , and i was mesmerized ! <sssss> i got 6 christmas bath bombs -lrb- 4 of them for free ! -rrb- <sssss> and 3 travel-sized snow fairy shower gels -lrb- another christmas product , and by far one of my favorite lush products ever -rrb- . <sssss> i also got some non-holiday bath bombs and melts because they were just too heavenly to pass up -lrb- i got a youki hi bath bomb , my favorite bath bomb ever , which was sadly discontinued sometime last year -rrb- . <sssss> i also got my first piece of lush soap -lrb- sexy peel . <sssss> all the citrus just makes me smile when i use this soap . <sssss> it 's sunshine in your shower -rrb- since i used to work in the mall i would go into lush whenever i had a break and get a couple things , and the staff always recognized me :-rrb- they even offered me a hand-cream sample one day when i was complaining of dry hands . <sssss> i brought some of my friends from school in and told the girl behind the counter that they were newbies , so she rushed out from behind the counter to demonstrate everything in the store ! <sssss> literally , she showed us bath bombs , bubble bars , face cleansers and toners , massage bars , and dusting powders . <sssss> i was so impressed by her powder demo that i bought some candy fluff dusting powder -lrb- another item that has since been discontinued . <sssss> vanilla puff powder is a nice substitute -rrb- . <sssss> this store holds a special place in my heart because it was the first lush store i ever went to , and i will forever have fond memories of the staff that dazzled me , and every time i smell sexy peel soap or snowfairy shower gel i am reminded of that magical day : -rrb- 
5		yum . <sssss> after doing some shopping at the mekong plaza we decided on having lunch here . <sssss> very clean , which is a big plus for a vietnamese establishment . <sssss> the food was great , very tasty . <sssss> would love to back . 
5		i took my grandson to one of my favorite places , the grotto , for lattes . <sssss> i 'd never had their coffee yet so i decided on a mocha and as i was telling the lady at the counter that the one drink i 'm familiar with is carmel macchiato she said michael could make me a drink like it . <sssss> so of course i changed my order and said go for it . <sssss> he made a great carmel latte . <sssss> loved it . <sssss> good job michael !! 
5		love ! <sssss> love ! <sssss> love ! <sssss> i work at 22nd avenue and mcdowell and there really is n't much in the way of healthy food that 's relatively quick and wo n't cost you an arm and a leg . <sssss> organic and non-gmo is something that 's also very important to me , but good luck finding all three of those things within 10 miles of my work . <sssss> i first found d'lish on urban spoon around a month ago , and have since been back enough to fill up my `` buy 7 , get your 8th free '' card . <sssss> i can not say enough great things about this place ! <sssss> i 've tried something new every time i 've gone back and have yet to find something i did n't love . <sssss> and , their garlic fries ... i 'm practically drooling now just thinking about them ! <sssss> not to mention the complimentary strawberry basil water ! <sssss> if you have n't gone here yet , you do n't know what you 're missing . <sssss> this place makes eating healthy feel like a treat ! 
5		this place is exactly what we were looking for . <sssss> great ambiance , friendly service , and delicious food !! <sssss> we shared the baked goat cheese appetizer , which was soooo decadent . <sssss> my husband had the cioppino stew and said it had incredible flavor . <sssss> i had the forbidden -lrb- but not tonight -rrb- rice , a really exotic and fresh dish . <sssss> -lrb- lots of vegetarian options here . -rrb- <sssss> we usually skip dessert , but since we were having such a great time we splurged for the turtle of amazingness . <sssss> loved it , and we 'll definitely be back , hopefully during happy hour to try out some of the specialty drinks that seemed a little spendy at full price -lrb- $ 9 -rrb- . 
5		best pizza in scottsdale ! <sssss> i was referred by a family friend . <sssss> first of all the atmosphere is great and the restaurant is beautiful . <sssss> great wine selection and fabulous patio ! <sssss> will come back every time i visit scottsdale ! 
5		always fast here ! <sssss> love that i do n't have to give myself 15-20 minutes extra anymore to get coffee at the starbucks by my house because now i found this one by work and only spend 5-10 minutes here without having to worry about being late . <sssss> only thing is that the cars in line do n't pay attention when the lines moves because it moves so fast . <sssss> if they got off their phone and paid attention it would go ever faster ! 
5		wow ! <sssss> what a great little store in chandler . <sssss> i fell inspired every time i leave the shop . <sssss> love the employees because they 're so helpful . <sssss> i took a class and the instructors were great . <sssss> green table gift store is a must see for anyone who really enjoys adorable gift ideas . 
5		i 've been taking my dog , roxy , for doggie daycare one or two days a week while i work . <sssss> she is like a different dog ! <sssss> she loves playing and running out her energy and she is so much happier at home after playing all day . <sssss> the staff have always been very nice and professional . <sssss> it 's a little bit pricey but a great place to go . 
5		cool patio , we sat out back where there were nice big booths with benches to sit on , lots of decorations everywhere and funny signs to read . <sssss> food was good all around the table - chips & salsa , street tacos , breakfast burrito , mini chimis , & chicken flautas . <sssss> not one complaint from anybody we were with . <sssss> we were in there on a friday night and they had a nice flow of music from a deejay and a girl walking around with whipped jell-o shots , fun environment for sure ! <sssss> was a good crowd without being overly crowded too . 
5		thank you jen & mike for making what i expected to be a hard decision so easy ! <sssss> my boyfriend and i will do all of our future shopping at this location ! <sssss> whatever you need here ask for them , jen is the store manager and mike was more than amazing ! <sssss> they told us that not many people knew about this location and i promised i would change that ! <sssss> make sure to post your awesome experience next ! <sssss> i love my ring !!!! 
5		i 'm giving tea light cafe an extra star -lrb- well deserved -rrb- for being an independent restaurant in the middle of corporate-eatery-scottsdale . <sssss> but rest assured , the food , value and experience merit a solid 4 stars if not higher . <sssss> i dine here often and every meal has been spot on . <sssss> ethnic food is a staple of mine and vietnamese dining is always a treat ; i think it 's healthier than other varieties , but what do i know . <sssss> i 'm still eating off value menus . <sssss> i 've had the pho several times , and it 's very good ; but i 'm not a big pho fan . <sssss> it 's soup . <sssss> i do n't care how big the bowl is ... soup is not a meal . <sssss> it 's an appetizer . <sssss> if i want a light meal , i order their spring rolls . <sssss> they 're loaded with shrimp and some other meat -lrb- i think it 's pork -rrb- and the wrapping is see-through . <sssss> i can see what 's inside the roll . <sssss> i love them . <sssss> yes they are appetizers too , so if you follow my philosophy , they should not count as a meal either . <sssss> but they are shaped like hot dogs , which are a meal . <sssss> are you following this ? <sssss> my favorite dish is `` the number 3 '' which is a huge bowl filled with rice noodles , grilled beef , lots of veggies and it 's topped with an awesome egg roll . <sssss> see the pic uploaded by renick t. that 's my dish and i 'm sticking with it . <sssss> this dish is featured at many vietnamese establishments . <sssss> tea light does it very well . <sssss> when i eat this dish , the entire world comes into balance and i feel an inner connection to the universe . <sssss> the buddha statutes in the shop come to life and smile lovingly upon me , my meal , my table and my pals . <sssss> ooooohhhhhmmmmmm . 
5		the pub . <sssss> my favorite place to go to happy hour . <sssss> the drinks are strong and cheap and the company is great . <sssss> all of the bartenders are on a first name basis with most customers and are genuine and awesome . <sssss> service is always spot on and the drinks are the same . <sssss> some have said its a locals only type place which majority is locals but anybody can come to the put and have an awesome time . <sssss> love love love the pub !! 
5		one of my favorite places to eat . <sssss> i love their pizza and wings . <sssss> this time i got the lunch special with my son and getting two pizzas and a free soda was awesome . <sssss> only spent 5 dollars and change . 
5		big fan of the gyro picada salad , have it all the time . <sssss> i 'm on a moderate carb diet -lrb- less than 120 carbs -rrb- and the pita is one of the 3 things i reserve my carb-space for . <sssss> it comes with a healthy serving along with the salad . <sssss> i eat there at least twice a week . <sssss> great food and awesome service . <sssss> ask for angela , she 's absolutely wonderful ! 
5		let me just start by saing the food is good , not great but good . <sssss> but why i love this place is cause of the tv 's and the atmosphere ! <sssss> i mean i can go and watch anything from football to bikini contests from soccer to water polo all at once !! <sssss> they have so many tv 's . 
5		the customizable soda station gets 4 stars alone ! <sssss> but then i had my burger . <sssss> delish ! <sssss> the bun was toasted but also super soft which does n't normally work but it was perfect ! <sssss> i 'm not normally a big fan of fries , could take them or leave them , but five guy 's fries are sooooooo very good !!!! <sssss> i 'd never heard of this place until the other day when i was in phoenix with my boyfriend . <sssss> he suggested it and so i said `` what the heck '' . <sssss> so glad i made that decision . <sssss> then i go on the website and find out they have locations in the seattle area ! <sssss> this could be very good or very bad depending on how you look at it . <sssss> one suggestion , if your appetite is n't very large , go with the little burger . <sssss> my boyfriend has been here before and warned me ahead of time . <sssss> it was very good size on its own so i 'm glad i didnt go with the regular one . <sssss> they also give you tons of toppings options at no extra charge . <sssss> all in all , ca n't say anything bad about this place . <sssss> they even have peanuts you can munch on until your order is up . 
5		this is the best burger in phoenix . <sssss> no frills , just a great , great open-flame char-broiled burger . <sssss> a double cheese , that 's what they call 1/2 pounder , with fries and a large drink was a shade under $ 7 . <sssss> this burger is better than smashed , freddies , even zin . <sssss> this is just a great cheeseburger . <sssss> seriously . <sssss> go there now ! <sssss> closed sundays . <sssss> but go there now ! 
5		these guys are awesome !!!! <sssss> very professional , great with customers , bright , conscientious and polite . <sssss> i swear they could serve the devil himself !!!! <sssss> i do this a lot . <sssss> these guys are good !!!!!!! 
5		what a cute place . <sssss> it 's a wood fired pizza restaurant in the middle of a residential neighborhood , really random ! <sssss> the pizza was very good , a lot better than the huge waits at pizzeria bianca . <sssss> i have never had their pizza so i ca n't compare , but this is really good pizza with no wait . <sssss> saturday at 5 pm , walked right in and got to sit outside . <sssss> i have n't seen the inside so i have no idea what it is like in there , but outside is really nice , the birds even walk right up to the table and then fly away . <sssss> they have `` root beer '' it 's not root beer , it 's sarsaparilla marked root beer , it was one of the best sarsaparilla 's i 've had though but i would not really have it again as i prefer real root beer . <sssss> the salsicca and genova pizzas were both great . <sssss> salsicca was salami and cheese and the genova was cheese and some dark greens . <sssss> both were really good tasting and not burnt . <sssss> i also had the cioccolino which is a thick chocolate liquer shot . <sssss> it was strong but pretty good , but super thick , almost too thick . <sssss> i must say it 's hard to find normal pizzas here , which speaks to the authenticity , but be careful if you bring picky eaters . 
5		each team member at hillside unleashed is top-notch . <sssss> you ca n't find a better group of people to work with and care for your dogs . <sssss> our 4 dogs ended up spending 22 days with them . <sssss> as much as we missed them the staff of unleashed kept us updated . <sssss> we knew they had the best possible care and they were having fun each day ! <sssss> our minds were at ease and we were able to concentrate on moving to our new home . 
5		truly fantastic food . <sssss> everything was full of richly layered flavors , great presentation , friendly service . <sssss> a strong competitor to mission in old town scottsdale . 
5		pretty sure i 've never seen a menu that is so unique , diverse , while being delicious . <sssss> do not go here expecting your `` run-of-the-mill '' menu . <sssss> it 's all a new experience , and a delicious one . <sssss> a lot of care and thought has gone into the menu , however , if the standard `` meat and potatoes '' is your thing , you should probably hit mcdonald 's . <sssss> the tots are not really tots and change every day . <sssss> it 's always a treat to go to the pig & pickle . 
5		found this place on yelp , and had to give it a try . <sssss> exceeded our expectations ! <sssss> the fuego pasta dish is amazing , a definite must have . <sssss> the boyfriend loved the pork nachos as well . 
5		houston 's is a great upscale rib chain . <sssss> the location at the camelback esplenade is a really nice location -lrb- although i 've never been to any other location so i ca n't make comparisons -rrb- . <sssss> the place has a great atmosphere ; the dim lighting really works . <sssss> there are often long waits during peak times , but there 's a tunnel to biltmore fashion park across the street , so you can kill a little time if you have a really long wait . <sssss> the service can be a little slow , as it was on my last visit back in december , but the servers are good . <sssss> i have to say , i 've never had the ribs before , but i 've heard that they are outstanding . <sssss> next time i 'm in phoenix , i 'll have to try them . <sssss> my favorite thing here is the hickory burger . <sssss> it is excellent . <sssss> it 's a burger topped with canadian bacon , cheddar cheese , and smothered with barbecue sauce . <sssss> shoestring fries accompany the burger . <sssss> the burger just tastes really good . <sssss> the combination of the barbecue sauce and cheese on the underlying patty works really well . <sssss> the meat tastes great too , which helps . <sssss> the bacon also adds to it . <sssss> the fries are really good here ; you have a selection of sides , but the fries are definitely the best choice . <sssss> they 're really thin , but they 're full of flavor . <sssss> i had the apple walnut cobbler for dessert . <sssss> it 's huge ! <sssss> everything about it was outstanding . <sssss> the apples with the walnuts , the ice cream , it was all good . <sssss> overall , if you 're looking for a really good , upscale american place in the valley , head to houston 's either on camelback or scottsdale . <sssss> it 's worth it . <sssss> now if only they 'd open up a location in ne ohio -lrb- there are a lot of great chains with valley locations that are n't in cleveland -rrb- . 
5		i love this place ! <sssss> if only it was n't so far from where i live . <sssss> . <sssss> i would go all the time . <sssss> i do occasionally make the drive because the coffee is delicious ! <sssss> i 've had the best coffee that i 've ever had here . <sssss> i also get the black and white . <sssss> it 's amazing . <sssss> i also ordered the mac and cheese ! <sssss> would recommend that to anyone who goes here ! <sssss> the atmosphere is a bit on the `` hipster-ish '' side but it 's nice . 
5		try the charred fillet . <sssss> moist and tender inside . <sssss> excellent . <sssss> for 2 people without drinks or appetizers it was about $ 100 . <sssss> my fiancée had the prime rib and we shared a dessert . <sssss> i rarely review on a one time visit , but we will be back . <sssss> . <sssss> and the stars on this review is subject to change . 
5		feast of awesomeness ! <sssss> i always get the fries & gyro well done . <sssss> ask for a side of red potatoes in a word banging !! <sssss> ohh and the staff is wicked cool !!! <sssss> p.s. . <sssss> they also have a tough mudder finisher working here . 
5		best beef gyro i 've ever had . <sssss> the entire staff are very friendly and attentive . <sssss> this is by far my favorite place . <sssss> even when my mom comes into town from texas she always askes me to take her to lunch here . <sssss> the prices are very reasonable ; and the portions are appropriate . <sssss> everything is made fresh . <sssss> i also love love love the salmon dish and sautee spinach . 
5		lovely and delightful is this new girl lola . <sssss> i 'm a total sucker for a good , cinnamon-y mexican style coffee , and lola has an amazing one -lrb- it 's called the matador and comes complete with three shots of espresso and a dollop of homemade flavored whipped cream -- $ 4 for a large . -rrb- <sssss> the actual coffee house space is fantastic , as you would expect from anything wayne touches . <sssss> shiny polished concrete floors , with a mix of modern and retro fixtures throughout . <sssss> makes me very happy . <sssss> being able to bring an iced coffee over to haus and oliver and annie makes me even happier . <sssss> ca n't wait for hula 's modern tiki to open up in this plaza , too . 
5		great pizza . <sssss> so fresh . 
5		let me start with saying i 'm not even a huge fan of mexican food . <sssss> now do n't get me wrong . <sssss> i like it ok , it 's just not something i crave . <sssss> my friend bev brought me here for lunch one day because we were craving beer and a good salad and it has quickly become a favorite . <sssss> thier chips and salsa are so , so delicious and i 'm really picky about chips and salsa . <sssss> the chips are nice and thin and arrive hot and the salsa is fresh and just a little bit spicy . <sssss> their margaritas are top notch -lrb- my husband always gets the cadillac -rrb- and many claim that their 's are the best in the valley . <sssss> i do n't know if that 's true , but they 're damn good . <sssss> now my husband is a huge fan of their pollo a la queso crema . <sssss> it 's a flour tortilla stuffed with chicken , deep fried -lrb- like a chimichanga and topped with seasoned cream cheese & melted cheeses . <sssss> you 'll be my new bff if you 'll go halfsies with me on their topopo salad and mini beef tacos . <sssss> so yummy . <sssss> the topopo salad salad is a regular green salad tossed with the yuumiest vinaigrette then topped with mixed veggies and then chicken , slices of avacado , pickled jalapeños , tomatoes , cheddar cheese and topped with cottage cheese stuffed tomato . <sssss> and the best part : it 's sitting on a tostada covered in a thin layer of guacamole ! <sssss> i know it does n't sound that exciting or even that unusal , but it is so damn good . <sssss> like i said , i 'm not a big mexican food addict , but i crave this place all the time . <sssss> thier food is always really good , very fresh and never fails to please . 
5		these guys were great . <sssss> i had picked up a nail in one of my tires and they fixed it in less than an hour with no appointment and they did n't even charge me for labor . <sssss> i highly recommend them . <sssss> i will be buying my tires from them in the future . 
5		this is the best wedding venue ever ! <sssss> my fiancé and i have booked our wedding here for may and already i 'm in love with everything it has to offer . <sssss> the have an amazing package deal which includes everything but the officiant , photographer , and alcohol . <sssss> but even so , the fabulous coordinators there will glady give you recommendations for these services . <sssss> the planning process is so easy as they take care of mostly everything , you just tell them your preferences . <sssss> they offer tasting events for the food and different meetings to talk about florals and linens . <sssss> they completely take away the stress from the planning of your event . <sssss> the food , linens and vendors they use are first class . <sssss> i ca n't wait for my wedding now !!!! <sssss> i fall in love with it more and more everyday ! <sssss> thank you ashley manor ! <sssss> i highly recommend this venue for your wedding or event ! <sssss> very happy with everything they have to offer . 
5		went there last night and it was excellent as always . <sssss> we enjoyed the stuffed pork tenderloin special and the friendly service . <sssss> great local place . 
5		oregano 's has upbeat and attentive young servers - servers who actually seem happy to be there ! <sssss> this always is a plus in dining out . <sssss> our delicious thin crust pizza with sundried tomatoes , pepperoni , mushrooms , -lrb- your choice of toppings -rrb- was one of the best i 've had in the valley . <sssss> i loved the chicken caesar salad which was superior to most - it was topped with pulled chicken , shaved parmesan slices and a tangy caesar dressing . <sssss> oregano 's is a comfy upbeat restaurant with great service and great food - an excellent time was had by all ! 
5		three words : fergie 's big bite . <sssss> as if baseball and sun were n't enough , the cubs decided we needed to be presented with a fantastic breaded pork tenderloin sandwich . <sssss> the folks from dewitt iowa who sell this thing should open a stand on my block . <sssss> i 'd buy 45 a week . <sssss> forty . <sssss> five . 
5		this is my daughter 's favorite restaurant . <sssss> the owner is very nice and always visits our table and takes a personal interest in our lives . <sssss> the sushi is always fresh and delicious ! 
5		i found this place in a trailer near downtown phx 12 years ago -- then they were in the great az bbq cook off and i loved their ribs -- been looking for them for years an just found them today -- the rib tips and the ribs are still fantastic -- they are close to the airport in a real location go try them 
5		ok just to preface - if you are going to pizzeria bianco , you better know you are going for the experience not just the food . <sssss> but for the record , the food - is amazing . <sssss> be prepared ... yes , the wait is long . <sssss> yea , on a wednesday , you probably dont want to be waiting 2 + hours for a 14 dollar pizza . <sssss> but you have to respect why its this long wait exists - chris bianco single-handedly makes every single pizza fresh to order . <sssss> by himself . <sssss> the wait is made far less worse by hitting up his 3rd business directly next door , bar bianco . <sssss> its reasonably priced with 8 bucks a glass - ps you must try the moscato , its sweet but amazing . <sssss> the ambiance is calm and relaxing , just sit back with a cheese plate and a glass and enjoy . <sssss> so accept it . <sssss> this man knows what he 's doing - his flavors are fresh , unique , and individual . <sssss> portions are perfect , prices are very reasonable -lrb- 14 av . <sssss> per pizza -rrb- very decent wine and beer selection . <sssss> there is no dessert , but trust that you wont need it ! <sssss> if you live in phoenix , you like fresh food , you will love bianco 's greatness . 
5		random , but why is this hp so very very much better than its original scottsdale counterpart ? <sssss> i have no idea , but the service is better and the food is better . <sssss> the antipasto platter is delicious in its simplicity : slices of fresh bread , some weird salami stuff i ca n't pronounce , marinated grape tomatoes with basil , chunks of parm and cheddar cheeses , a small bowl of big weird spicy olives . <sssss> that puppy did n't last five minutes at our table . <sssss> the pizza ? <sssss> surprisingly good , crispy and coated with corn meal on its underbelly , bursting with fresh goat cheese and roasted red peppers on top . <sssss> a tip for those of you who find the usually flaccid crusts associated with wood-fired pizzas distasteful : get it well done . <sssss> crispy and delicious . <sssss> the dessert ? <sssss> oh sweet dear god in heaven . <sssss> hp has its own version of a `` pizzookie '' , which is a half-baked cookie in a pizza-esque tin with ice cream on top , not some weird porn trick or jersey shore freak show . <sssss> this is the single most perfect version of the pizzookie on the planet : barely baked , hot melty chocolate chip cookie dough , hidden under three scoops of vanilla ice cream . <sssss> the cookie dough is all hot and gooey and the juxtaposition against the frosty ice cream is just divine . <sssss> seriously , my mouth is watering even thinking about it . <sssss> yeah . <sssss> and perhaps hp 's most incredible accomplishment of all : my so , my father , and myself -- perhaps the three individually and collectively most picky , bitchy , and nitpicky people on the planet -- are all . <sssss> happy . <sssss> there . <sssss> sold ! <sssss> we will be back , again and again . 
5		best `` cheap burger lunch '' on the planet . <sssss> fries are made fresh cut in house . <sssss> i have never eaten a bad lunch here for the last 8 years ! <sssss> scottsdale also has an in and out on frank lloyd wright . <sssss> expect long lines in the drive through with 20 min wait if you get there at noon . <sssss> seating can also be limited because of the demand . 
5		love the gilbert farmers market . <sssss> love it !! <sssss> we stumbled upon it during our 45 minute wait for the farmhouse while on vacation last year . <sssss> there were so many vendors and everything looked so good . <sssss> when we moved here late last year , i was happy we got a place so close . <sssss> pros : great produce at multiple stands . <sssss> tons of samples . <sssss> entertaining for the kids . <sssss> i always leave with something i did n't intend to buy . <sssss> cons : i wish it ran later than noon . 
5		i have been to eddie 's house twice now . <sssss> the first time i went in just to check it out and sat at the bar . <sssss> luckily they had happy hour going all night so i ordered two appetizers for myself which were the lamb chops and smoked calamari . <sssss> the lamb chops were excellent and highly recommended . <sssss> the smoked calamari was different but i would n't order it again because the smoked flavor almost tasted like a hot dog to me but the spice was good . <sssss> my second time i went for a friends birthday and someone at the table ordered the chicken lollipops as an appetizer and they were bigger than we expected so a couple people ordered them as an entrée . <sssss> i ordered the roasted chicken with creamed spinach and fingerling potatoes which was forgotten about so everyone was finished with their dinners before i got mine . <sssss> even though i had to wait it was still delicious with a crispy skin with a moist inside . <sssss> it also had a cream sauce that i soaked up with my chicken . <sssss> the server did buy me a drink for the mess up and she also got us a free birthday dessert . <sssss> i will be back 
5		love this place ! <sssss> unique flavors , very low prices and a great place to take the kids ! 
5		they get through a line of six or more customers in a couple minutes , prepare your order while you pay and wait . <sssss> in about five minutes they have your order packaged , call your name and then bring it to you . <sssss> if you are eating your food here they bring it to your table . <sssss> . <sssss> i like this location , great service and friendly staff every time . 
5		i can not say enough wonderful things about this spa and tiffany ! <sssss> she has a warm and welcoming attitude and the spa atmosphere is airy and inviting , relaxing and very clean and fresh . <sssss> her services are to die for and she makes sure you leave satisfied with her work . <sssss> she is very knowledgeable about skin products and recommends according to your needs . <sssss> i have been going to her for over 6 years and i would not go to anyone else . 
5		quite possibly the best restaurant in the greater phoenix area . <sssss> almost everything is recommended from daily dim sum breakfasts , to sesame chicken afternoon lunches , to chilean seabass dinner , to nightclub and beer on weekends . <sssss> highly recommended . 
5		nice golf courses . <sssss> easy to find and to get to . <sssss> i 've walked around the gold courses before and they 're all really nice . <sssss> the views are awesome , especially if it 's during the winter time when it 's cooler . 
5		yes , five stars ! <sssss> first review and i thought i 'd make it a good one . <sssss> from start to finish a fantastic experience . <sssss> the fish is * so * fresh and perfectly prepared . <sssss> my friend had a bone in filet - best steak we 've ever had . <sssss> just done to perfection . <sssss> the ambiance is nice - definitely upscale and vibrant . <sssss> and once it cools down a bit , i can not wait for the patio to get going . <sssss> great job wildfish , i will definitely be back ! 
5		excellent customer service , well-organized and a fantastic produce section . <sssss> i enjoy my shopping trips to this store . <sssss> great job in the floral department , too -- my flowers and balloons for a bridal shower were arranged and completed within minutes . 
5		amazing ! <sssss> never a dull or bad experience . <sssss> their campfire sundae is insane ! <sssss> we always bring out of town guests here . <sssss> i love that they sell their ice cream in whole foods . 
5		great selection of yogurt flavors , very clean , and friendly staff . <sssss> om nom nom !! <sssss> i will be back again . <sssss> . <sssss> especially since it is next door to chipotle . 
5		new staff , new menu , amazing food , amazing view and great company if you sit at the bar ! <sssss> i have been there twice now since their changeover and everything was top notch both times . <sssss> great place for a girls night -lrb- pedicures next door , then head over for great food & drinks -rrb- or a romantic date night on the patio . 
5		this place is a perfect mix of everyday and exotic . <sssss> the food is fantastic , the service is excellent -lrb- thank you liz ! -rrb- <sssss> , and the prices are very reasonable to make you come back time and again ! <sssss> we will definitely be back -lrb- yet again ! -rrb- 
5		my husband and i were craving pho last weekend and after an unfortunate experience at another vietnamese restaurant we ended up here . <sssss> i 'm so glad we did ! <sssss> the service was quick and very friendly and the pho was the best i 've had in a long time ! <sssss> we will definitely be back ! 
5		this place is so neat ! <sssss> yes , i realize i just said neat . <sssss> it is an outdoor classroom and nursery offering only edible fruit and vegetable plants . <sssss> so much potential for growth not only for the space , but for sharing of information and ideas . <sssss> looking forward to many years of the urban farm nursery and what it can teach me ! <sssss> thank you greg for always moving forward . <sssss> you have taught us so much . <sssss> good people . <sssss> good work . 
5		el chorro lodge is not the place to go for cutting-edge cuisine to tickle your tastebuds , but exactly the right place to go when you want to entertain friends with a unique arizona experience and no risk of disappointment . <sssss> you will find great southwestern atmosphere , a beautiful patio , good service , pleasant outdoor service with great views of the mountains , plenty of good food for fussy eaters , and lots of history . <sssss> and sticky buns . <sssss> you wo n't find uniquely southwestern food , just traditional american fare . 
5		i love to sit there with my drink and read my stuff . <sssss> i am so comfortable to be there by myself for hours . <sssss> tables outside is nice . <sssss> the plant in the pots are cute . <sssss> all smashes are awesome , especially the one with almonds . <sssss> fruit cake is great -lrb- not too sweet -rrb- 
5		everything i have had has been awesome !!!!! 
5		a unique park-like setting , located at the back of a modest farm . <sssss> many lovely things to look at while you wait . <sssss> the brunch is served very casually , on paper plates , which seems strange for what is essentially gourmet food , but maybe it keeps the costs down . 
5		we saw vovomeena was listed as the best breakfast in the neighborhood by the new times so figured we 'd give it a sunday morning go . <sssss> what a great place ! <sssss> it 's hidden behind the five guys in that center so we 'd never even seen it before . <sssss> we were fortunate that it was not as busy as some other yelpers have experienced and , showing up during a lull , the coffee bar guy even came over and discussed the menu with us . <sssss> great service , great food , love the atmosphere and coffee . <sssss> and all just an easy bike ride down 5th ave. sinfully delicious but a worthwhile breakfast bookmark . 
5		i have been to this restaurant twice , the food is delicious and a good value . <sssss> the wait staff is attentive and personable ! 
5		you ca n't go just once to chino . <sssss> it just does n't work that way . <sssss> your first time there they 'll walk you though the whole process and let you sample all the different flavors they have of meat and even rice and beans . <sssss> you 're thinking - wow this is great - free appetizers . <sssss> oh no . <sssss> what really just happened is `` they got you '' . <sssss> oh yes . <sssss> because no matter how good your food was , you 'll be wondering ... hmmm ... i wonder how that would have been as a burrito ? <sssss> or , wow , that other one might have been fun as a quesadilla . <sssss> or , wow , i did n't realize i 'd burn my mouth on that , maybe next time i wo n't try to look like a big dog in front of the honeys . <sssss> something like that . <sssss> kids love going to chino . <sssss> the giant panda bandito statue is meant to be climbed on and loved . <sssss> they have a kids menu too - which is so important . <sssss> sue , the location kinda looks like a hole in the wall , but who does n't love hole in the wall places ??? 
5		delicious coffee , wi-fi , a play area for kids , beautiful patio , comfy seating inside . <sssss> baristas are knowledgeable and friendly . <sssss> just go , you wo n't regret it . 
5		think of how boring phoenix would be without this landmark . <sssss> the only problem is that we need a few more of these mountains . <sssss> i mean , have you tried climbing this thing on a saturday morning ? <sssss> it 's as bad as a black friday at macy 's . <sssss> nonetheless , glad to have this nearby . 
5		i almost cried during my meal here because phoenix needs this restaurant so badly . <sssss> it 's hip and kind of elegant at the same time with stylized comfort food that 's familiar but new at the same time . <sssss> the cheddar scallion biscuits with bacon jam and a sunny side up quail egg ... sublime ! <sssss> basil risotto was simply perfect and a great vegetarian option . <sssss> and while the lemon blueberry cheesecake was good , the accompanying tortilla ice cream changed my life ; i could have eaten an entire plate of the ice cream alone . <sssss> blue hound is attached to the new hotel palomar , which is also well worth a visit , if only to see the ultra cool arizona wing back chairs which i now want for my living room ! 
5		this place is so awesome !!!!! <sssss> the food is amazing and the owners are just as good as it gets . <sssss> i am middle eastern and can cook the food , so i am not usually impressed with greek food however this place is the only one i will go to if my family and i go out to eat ... i really do love it here 
5		great and useful service . <sssss> with me only having cats though , i wish they 'd bring free cat toys instead of free dog biscuits . 
5		my visit to the peoria sports complex was a dream come true ! <sssss> i mingled among my favorite san diego padres and swapped stories with other fans . <sssss> the staff is super friendly ; one gentleman , john bear helped us snag a photo with skipper bud black ! <sssss> another hooked my son up with a pin and stickers . <sssss> we loved hanging out at the perfectly manicured practice fields as well as enjoying two games at the stadium . <sssss> it 's family-friendly , clean , and the price is right ! 
5		bryan 's is now my favorite place to eat in cave creek and has ignited a passion for bbq that i did n't know i had . <sssss> i work relatively close so i 've been going in about once or twice a week for the last 3 months or so . <sssss> the owner and staff are awesome and the service is great . <sssss> i 'm absolutely in love with the beef brisket , the sauce is amazing , the meat moist , tender and the bun is lightly toasted which just tops everything off perfectly . <sssss> the beans are my side of choice , they have this wonderful smokey , whiskey like flavor to them , the coleslaw is also pretty tasty . <sssss> the pulled pork and ribs are also very good , with the chicken just slightly below both of them . <sssss> bryan is also a nice little selection of craft beer to go along with your bbq , such as dogfish head and deschutes brews , plus the standard fare of domestic beers . 
5		absolutely outstanding ! <sssss> i am always on the lookout for high quality coffee and cartel has just set a new standard . <sssss> they roast their own beans on site and their coffee is the freshest i have ever tasted . <sssss> i tried their mocha and found it incredible well balanced and smooth , with just the right amount of character . <sssss> i am very picky about my coffee and the coffee shops i will spend money at ... this place is my new favorite in the phoenix area . <sssss> i love the atmosphere and the counter folks were very friendly and knowledgeable . <sssss> i will be back ! 
5		very friendly service . <sssss> : -rrb- 
5		great italian food and a great ambiance . <sssss> i dont know the prices or menu options because we ate here for a wedding rehearsal . <sssss> the food was great and so was the service . <sssss> our waiter and waitress were very professional . <sssss> i would recommend this place . <sssss> its the best italian food i have had this side of the country !! 
5		the soup was amazing . <sssss> tasted so light and fresh . 
5		i would like to praise table tops etc for providing professional and beautiful service on my wedding day . <sssss> the tables were beautifully decorated the service was impeccable . <sssss> i had a vision three particular different tables for my wedding day , and it included a lot of colors and imagination , and they were able to meet and exceed my expecations . 
5		seriously best customer service by a repair shop i have had in a long time . <sssss> i will never get my tires anywhere else . <sssss> greeted me outside and quickly assessed what i needed and made a recommendation . <sssss> explained benefits of options and warranty . <sssss> only took 25 min to change . <sssss> best service ever . 
5		wow amazing all the topping you want for $ 7.75 ! <sssss> what a great place . <sssss> we will come back for sure . 
5		first visit was during happy hour on a friday at the scottsdale quarter . <sssss> let me just say , best damn happy hour around and not just cause of the drink specials . <sssss> the sushi specials can not be beat , dragon roll or las vegas roll for $ 6 ... that 's just insanely good . <sssss> the service is top notch , we did not go without anything . <sssss> i took a sip of my ice tea , she was there to replenish . <sssss> the whole experience was amazing . <sssss> the sushi can not be beat . <sssss> fresh and top quality and i know my sushi . 
5		hands down the best frozen yogurt joint in town . <sssss> great selection of favors . <sssss> this place is always busy , for good reason . 
5		i know i can count on kim to provide passionate , centering tai chi in an easy and gentle format . <sssss> i always come away with less stress , renewed energy and general contentment . <sssss> and when i do n't have time for my private lessons with her , i use her two dvds at home ! <sssss> the principles of balance , mindfulness and flow have permeated all aspects of my life since studying with kim . <sssss> - at 
5		huge and fluffy donuts ! <sssss> super fresh and warm . <sssss> they also serve thai tea and smoothies in flavors like mango , green tea , and taro . <sssss> plus croissant , bagel , and biscuit sandwiches that are reasonably priced . <sssss> they also have a drive thru . <sssss> they 're open 7 days a week . <sssss> we went on a sunday at 5pm . 
5		loved this place ! <sssss> we sat at the bar for a glass of wine for quite a bit , then ordered our entrees . <sssss> the bartender was super friendly , and allowed me to try three wines before i ordered . <sssss> he made eye contact and did n't act rushed . <sssss> the service was excellent , food even better , and we left a very very very happy couple . <sssss> -lrb- unfortunately we had almost the exact opposite experience at our next stop - the side bar -rrb- . <sssss> highly recommend the public house . <sssss> classy , yet casual . <sssss> anything seems to go here . <sssss> sequins and sweatshirts . <sssss> i woke up this morning , yes , wanting my scallops entree again . <sssss> for breakfast . <sssss> that is kind of gross , but you get the picture . 
5		it 's really easy to find this place cause of it 's unique blue symmetry shapes . <sssss> when i first walk in i immediately felt really comfortable as i saw the fire pit and lots of umbrellas and table outdoor . <sssss> they also have a bar area and indoor as well . <sssss> after tried 4 appetizers that they had , i concur this place is one of the coziest place in phoenix that serves a superb meals :-rrb- i loved their pork tacos and would be coming back for more ! 
5		if you are looking for the best coffee and pastries in phx look no further . <sssss> the honey latte here is by far my favorite as well as any cookie , or the salted caramel bar . <sssss> the staff here really know their coffee , not to mention they are all really cool people as well . <sssss> if you are in downtown make it a point to stop in !!!! 
5		loved the sampler of different pickles . <sssss> the decor was fun . <sssss> our waitress was attentive and friendly , explaining to us the menu our first time there . <sssss> we had the reuben sandwich and the sliders . <sssss> both were delicious . <sssss> we did n't have any space left for dessert , but we did pick up some pastries for the drive home . 
5		the best bbq i have ever had , but oddly enough it was the olive coleslaw that stoled the show . <sssss> bryan 's is the best and bryan was very friendly ! 
5		you just ca n't go wrong - close your eyes , point anywhere on the menu , and you will be pleased . <sssss> also , be sure to try the soup , no matter what it is . 
5		have been waiting to try this place for a while and finally got the chance to go , and the food was spectacular ! <sssss> we decided to do drinks and some snacks and ended up getting carried away as the food was so good . <sssss> we started with a bottle of white wine . <sssss> . <sssss> it was excellent and also had their nosh board . <sssss> very tasty . <sssss> we then decided to try a pizzette the one with apple and gorgonzola ... delish ! <sssss> i almost wanted to hug the chef . <sssss> why have n't i been here before ? <sssss> i was kicking myself . <sssss> we ended things off with the pecan pie . <sssss> wowzahs !!! <sssss> might be one of the best i 've ever had . <sssss> thank you nosh ! <sssss> i am happy we are neighbors . 
5		read about this in the new times , so i just tried this wing challenge . <sssss> the rules are now all 10 wings in 8 minutes . <sssss> i am the 5th customer to win the challenge . <sssss> the wings are meaty , but tender so its easy to get the meat off the bone . <sssss> they are using the bhut jolakia `` ghost pepper '' which is the world 's hottest pepper to make the sauce . <sssss> pretty stinging hot stuff , this is not for a weak stomach . <sssss> bottom line : burns going in , burns comin ' out ! <sssss> newtimes wing challenge story : http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bella/2010/07/chik-a-ribs_lava_wing_challeng.php bhut jolakia pepper wiki : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bhut_jolokia_pepper 
5		another great spot in my neighboorhood ! <sssss> i had never eaten and a planet sub so i perused the menu and the gentleman behind the counter offered some advise . <sssss> i settled on the chicken parmesan sub and a cup of chicken enchilada soup . <sssss> my daughter got the kids meal with a grilled cheese , chips , and a drink . <sssss> the total was just under $ 14 . <sssss> great value ! <sssss> my sandwich was delicous ! <sssss> and the soup was tasty and had just a little kick to it . <sssss> my daughter loved her grilled cheese with all the yummy melted cheese and fresh baked bread . <sssss> while were were finishing up one of the gentleman that was working in the back came out to ask us how our dinner was . <sssss> he was in from kansas helping the store with some minor issues . <sssss> it appears those issues have been fixed because i told him everything was great and we would definetly be back since we live close by . <sssss> who does n't like fresh baked bread and fresh ingredients ? <sssss> they also have a punch card so that 's another great incentive ! <sssss> yum ! 
5		i have been to liberty market numerous times , for breakfast , lunch , and dinner . <sssss> by far dinner is my choice here . <sssss> was n't crazy about the breakfast . <sssss> not bad , just did n't `` wow '' me . <sssss> they have outstanding pizza . <sssss> i am a huge fan of brick oven pizza , and this is right up there . <sssss> the grilled chicken pasta is amazing , and the flat iron steak is one of my favorites too . <sssss> save room for dessert , as they have some great stuff to offer . <sssss> word of warning ... if you order the ice cream sandwich , share it with a group of 4 ! <sssss> it 's not small ! 
5		as i was finishing up my yelp reviews from a recent trip to firestone walker in paso robles , i was shocked to see i had not written about my new favorite brewery in az. . <sssss> `` finally ! <sssss> a brewery in north scottsdale ... '' is basically my reaction to fate brewery . <sssss> one `` fateful '' night -lrb- pun intended -rrb- when i decided to stop in to try their imperial ipa , a love affair began that i do n't anticipate ending anytime soon . <sssss> i will admit , at first , i was skeptcal . <sssss> there are so many places that have come and gone ... there will always be the places that `` have decent craft beer , for the area . '' <sssss> that was my initial hesitation upon opening , and is probably why it took me months to finally give them a try . <sssss> i was pleasantly surprised when the beer was one of the best i 've had in the valley . <sssss> although the location seems small , it 's more than adequate . <sssss> their patio is awesome in the cooler months . <sssss> they have enough tables where you never feel like you have to wait long , but never feel like it 's too empty . <sssss> personally i favor sitting at the bar , no matter where i go . <sssss> their bar is really cool , and the chairs are spaced appropriately so you do n't feel like you 're sitting on top of the person next to you . <sssss> on to the important stuff , the beer . <sssss> i 've noticed over the past few months , they have done a really good job of satisfying all palattes . <sssss> whether you 're a hop head , or more of a fruit beer , or maybe something darker , there has been at least one of each on their menu . <sssss> i am a hop head through and through , and their american pale ale and recently released ipa are my favorite in arizona right now . <sssss> they also often release specialty beers that have never disappointed -lrb- for instance , a coffee ipa -rrb- . <sssss> i have only had pizza there , and it was great . <sssss> love the hot chili oil . <sssss> the atmosphere to me is the closest you 'll get to a `` cheers '' type of bar . <sssss> maybe being from the east coast i 'm more acclimated to this type of vibe , but it 's small , quaint , welcoming , and inviting . <sssss> i have gone in with my husband , with my girlfriends , or sat by myself , and i 've always felt comfortable , and have always met really cool people along the way . <sssss> for me what sets this bar apart is the service . <sssss> steve has done a really great job of assembling an awesome team , who remembers who you are , and what you like to drink . <sssss> and steve is such a nice person . <sssss> it 's fun chatting him up about his beer . <sssss> their social media and website are always up to date , so check regularly to see if there 's anything special on . <sssss> i think what you do need to realize before going in is , it 's a small brewery with a decent size list of oustanding beers . <sssss> this is n't a yardhouse type of establishment . <sssss> and you do n't have to be a beer expert or beer snob to enjoy it . <sssss> from what i 've experienced , if you ever have any questions , or want to try anything , all you have to do is ask . 
5		mellow mushroom - wow as you may tell from recent reviews , i have been on a pizza crusade . <sssss> well , i took a friend to mellow mushroom today and the pizza rocked . <sssss> we shared the thai die pizza which had curry chicken and tasted awesome . <sssss> the crust was think and delicious the pizza burst with taste when i bit into it . <sssss> i am a traditional pizza guy but this diversion worked . <sssss> great service and a nice patio to eat topped it off . <sssss> i 'll be heading back ... soon 
5		my dog , riley , is a total disaster of a dog . <sssss> she 's so pretty , but there 's not much there in the way of smarts . <sssss> but we love her ! <sssss> so when she was bitten by a rattlesnake , i of course raced her here for treatment . <sssss> the staff are extremely knowledgable , smart , friendly and forthcoming with information . <sssss> they told me upfront that this was going to be expensive and all the different options . <sssss> no beating around the bush , nothing vague or general , just to the point . <sssss> it was great , totally got the hard part out of the way . <sssss> she was treated with kindness by people who obviously love animals . <sssss> yes , it was expensive , about $ 1700 , but obviously completely worth it . <sssss> so remember when i said riley is n't the smartest ? <sssss> yeah , well two days after the rattler incident , she ate a bottle of midol . <sssss> i again found myself back in the clinic . <sssss> most of the staff remembered her and treated me and her with the utmost in professionalism and concern . <sssss> that was another $ 650 . <sssss> -lrb- i love my dog . <sssss> . <sssss> i love my dog ... i love my dog . <sssss> . <sssss> i keep reminding myself ... -rrb- . <sssss> oy . <sssss> well anyway . <sssss> i would reccommend this clinic to anyone with a pet in distress . 
5		got ta love barro 's !! <sssss> used to load my car up with as many people as possible and drive over to barro 's for lunch ... much better than high school food ! <sssss> to this day -lrb- over 15 years -rrb- the pizza is * still * excellent !!! 
5		five stars for so many reasons . <sssss> upon my first bite , i put down my sandwich and signed onto yelp to write a rave review . <sssss> however , i thought this was pretty pre-mature and perhaps i should wait , finish my meal , experience the after-taste and then analyze and review . <sssss> with the help of the very friendly employee , i chose the pick two - getting a half chicken salad sandwich and a cup of potato cream cheese soup . <sssss> i waited for maybe , three minutes for my food , when another employee brought it over to me and i was ready to go ! <sssss> i went again today for breakfast -lrb- yogurt swirl and a banana nut muffin -rrb- and with these trips i feel qualified to give a meaningful review . <sssss> other than the the friendly/helpful employees and speedy service , the other highlights include - 1 -rrb- convenient location to tons of offices -lrb- one being mine -rrb- and next to my bank -lrb- chase -rrb- , 2 -rrb- and easy , likeable menu , 3 -rrb- tons of soups - honestly , sometimes for lunch all i want is soup ... and tasty soup at that ! <sssss> 4 -rrb- fresh bread - i think people take bread for granted ! <sssss> um , okay , so that 's it . <sssss> but seriously , so good . <sssss> will be a permanent lunch option for me 
5		loved amanda !!! <sssss> she was sweet and a huge help with my piercing tonight . <sssss> i 'm so thankful for her ! 
5		decent sushi , reasonable beer prices , decent happy hour , and large portions for a sushi bar in a popular-locale . <sssss> i would recommend the place . 
5		i have been going to la pinata for the past 30 + years . <sssss> this is mexican comfort food at its best . <sssss> the high quality of the food has remained the same over the years . <sssss> my `` usual '' is the green chili burro , enchilada style . <sssss> the green chili has consistently tender beef chunks in a rich beef and green chili gravy . <sssss> the crowning touch is the outstanding enchilada sauce . <sssss> with soft drinks , the meals for 2 cost a little over $ 20 . <sssss> over the past few years we have ventured off our normal orders and have tried the chili relleno , tamales , cheese enchiladas , and the salad carbon . <sssss> everything was absolutely delicious . <sssss> the staff is always friendly . <sssss> our usual waiter , matt , always takes very good care of us . <sssss> during the bad economy , i worried about this little family run business . <sssss> i am so happy to say that they are still going strong . <sssss> i highly recommend this restaurant to everyone . 
5		al pastor - with just cilantro and raw onion . <sssss> - do n't let anyone tell you there is another way to eat these orgasms in your mouth . <sssss> enjoy ! 
5		dear fez , we have courted on several occasions . <sssss> at first i thought maybe we were destined to be casual flings forever . <sssss> i loved your eclectic style mixed with your sensuality . <sssss> i 've always loved that you filled your delicious martinis to the brim , but in the back of my head thought you were always just trying to get me drunk . <sssss> your menu begs me to keep coming back for more whenever i get the chance . <sssss> however , you went above and beyond the other night , and it 's all thanks to your delightful server candace . <sssss> she is a diamond in the rough and needs to be given a handsome bonus or raise . <sssss> do not reward her with vacation though , as i expect her schedule to follow my fez cravings from here on out :-rrb- from the get go , my crew of out of towners were suspicious they would not receive their food in time to enjoy it , not be rushed , and be able to make their flights back home . <sssss> i was selfish and wanted to show them the best restaurant not in walking distance from the hotel and bussed them on the light rail to fez . <sssss> we informed the staff of our situation and apologized in advance . <sssss> and we experienced the best service i have ever had probably anywhere in the valley . <sssss> our waters were delivered promptly -lrb- but without bendie straws . <sssss> . <sssss> slight sad face -rrb- and we ordered immediately after . <sssss> candace never minded repeating the drink menu items as we did n't have but one of those menus on the table for all 10 of us . <sssss> our food came out quickly and all at the same time . <sssss> drinks were delivered with flair . <sssss> everyone spent the first few minutes moaning in happiness . <sssss> following it were a few moments of extreme gratitude for the delicious food and then a lot more silence as we devoured our meals without feeling like we were in a hurry any longer . <sssss> the bills were brought out . <sssss> . <sssss> separate ... to everyone right as some of us were about finished and needed to start thinking about a ride to the airport . <sssss> it was beautiful . <sssss> despite gratuity being included , i believe we all included extra because we truly appreciated our service and meals that night . <sssss> in fact , i can never finish my fries and fez burger so i had half sitting there and one of my friends asked if they could have some of it as it was so delicious the first time he had it . <sssss> i love you fez , and i always will . <sssss> you truly impressed me all over again , and left a great impression of what phoenix has to offer on visitors . 
5		love this place !! <sssss> after living in arizona for three years and having no luck finding a good thai place i stumbled upon this little gem . <sssss> i almost did n't go in because it really looked like an americanized little fast food place , however i was starving and my only other option was peter piper pizza -lrb- yuck -rrb- so in i went . <sssss> the first good sign was that all of the tables were full and there were probably 10-15 people waiting for take out . <sssss> it was very busy . <sssss> we got a seat and order some yellow curry and pad thai noodles . <sssss> when i bit into this food it was like angels were singing from heaven . <sssss> truly fantastic food !! <sssss> the prices are great as well and everyone who works there is super friendly . <sssss> this is now ` my ' thai restaurant in the phoenix area . <sssss> i highly recommend thai house ! 
5		good food and i love the fried ice cream 
5		one of the best food experiences i have ever had . <sssss> it 's a must for any real foodie . 
5		was in phx for work and one of my co workers took me there for lunch ... all i can say i had the best turkey sandwich i have ever eaten ... too bad i was n't around to enjoy happy hour ! 
5		honesty , integrity , and great service here ! <sssss> ask for the manager , mike . <sssss> first time i was here , a customer stopped in just to thank the manager for the integrity of service the manager had given the customer 's spouse . <sssss> i 've never seen that before ! <sssss> stopping in just to thank the manager ... ? <sssss> wow ! <sssss> this is the place ! 
5		i went here with a friend and we had a really great time . <sssss> i am updating my previous post because i didnt have a good time at all before . <sssss> she and i had a couple drinks and appetizers and everything was awesome this time . <sssss> a bit loud but thats to be expected . <sssss> i really do like this place now ! 
5		love tqla ! <sssss> happy hour rocks ! <sssss> you can sit anywhere in the restaurant ! <sssss> food is yummy , appetizer quesadillas are the best . 
5		the 5 star rating is based purely on their happy hour sushi menu . <sssss> we go and sit in the bar area and get the happy hour sushi . <sssss> it is so cheap and good . <sssss> also great service . <sssss> i recommend the hand rolls and philly rolls . <sssss> i usually get 2 hand rolls and a philly , and it costs less than 10 $ and is pretty filling ! <sssss> the fish tastes fresh and they use the best seaweed and rice . <sssss> sometimes i will also get some nigri if i am extra hungry . <sssss> best of all , dont forget the free hot green tea . 
5		my first visit to fez will definitely not be my last ! <sssss> the happy hour drink specials were a great way to start a memorable evening . <sssss> i ordered the cinnamon dusted sweet potato fries as a starter to share with my 4 companions . <sssss> they were perfectly prepared -- just the right combo of crispy , spicy , salty -- and the 5 of us were unable to finish them all ! <sssss> we each ordered a different entree and every plate except mine was clean . <sssss> the tangier burger was amazing with garlicky hummus , tasty manchego cheese , pesto , oven dried tomatoes -lrb- that thankfully were not over-dry and chewy -rrb- and a half pound of delicious beef served on just the right proportion of ciabatta bread . <sssss> i just could n't eat it all , but look forward to having the leftovers for lunch today . <sssss> a great surprise was the extra large cup of coffee after dinner . <sssss> i hope my email to the restaurant will result in them telling me what blend of coffee they use ... it was heavenly ! <sssss> the ambiance of fez is lively : `` sleek and urban '' is accurate . <sssss> early on a friday night the place was crowded and noisy , and it does attract a ` young-ish ' crowd -lrb- um , i felt ` old ' but that wo n't inhibit me from a return trip -rrb- ! <sssss> another plus : excellent service . 
5		for years i heard about borscht and pirozhki amongst other russian and east european favorites . <sssss> i always wondered what the hype was about borscht . <sssss> the problem is that there are n't many russian eateries in phoenix -lrb- just this place and another up north , that i know of -rrb- so i never had the chance to try out this cuisine . <sssss> then a russian friend told me about a russian-uzbeki place he heard about called samarkand restaurant and naturally i went , and he came along with me . <sssss> we 've actually been there twice already . <sssss> like mr. k 's review said , it 's in a strip mall which sits directly across the street from another strip mall in which the russian market resides -lrb- i have reviewed the russian market too -rrb- . <sssss> we walked in and immediately got a whiff of some sort of soup -lrb- it was pelmeni soup , more on that later -rrb- and got an eye full of the nice decor -lrb- they did some decorating since gina w 's earlier review -rrb- ; mirrored walls with pictures of domed mosques , a chandelier , gold inlay adorned tile floors , fancy dishware set out on each table , and of course , traditional uzbeki-russian music playing overhead . <sssss> behind the counter there 's a framed picture of mike tyson himself posing with with svetlana and her husband at the restaurant . <sssss> apparantly mike has a taste for more than just mutulated ears and he has stopped by a few times for a bite -lrb- no cheesy pun intended -rrb- . <sssss> we stepped forward and svetlana greeted us , told us to take a seat , and handed us menus . <sssss> the food is actually pretty good . <sssss> this is what we ordered on our first and second visits : ------------------------------ first visit : we were n't fully familiar with the menu , so svetlana sat down and walked us through the menu . <sssss> i got : ** borscht - the infamous borscht that i had heard so much about . <sssss> it was pretty good ; tasted similar to what i thought it would taste like . <sssss> ** pirozhki - small meat filled pies approximately the size of a dinner roll . <sssss> you 'll find these under the appetizer section as `` samsa '' , the uzbek alternate name , but they 'll know what you mean by pirozhki . <sssss> my friend and myself loved these . <sssss> we ate a couple of them . <sssss> l recommend you get a couple of these , you wo n't regret it . <sssss> our second visit was mainly inspired by the pirozhki and lipioshka alone . <sssss> ** lipioshka - a danish-like round bread served hot and fresh . <sssss> we shared it , and much like mr. k , we also really liked it and it 's very filling . <sssss> this bread comes with a tasty sauce that you dip the lipioshka into . <sssss> it 's much like salsa but with a greener/leafier taste . <sssss> i recommend also getting the lipioshka along with the pirozhki . <sssss> ** my friend also got pelmeni soup and two marinated beef kebabs with a complimentary side of rice . <sssss> ----------------------------- second visit : like the first time , we asked for pirozhki and a lipioshka again . <sssss> this time i decided to try the pelmeni soup and i came to find out that the whiff that you first get as you walk in is that of this soup . <sssss> i really do n't know why it smells like pelmeni , seeing as to how it 's obviously not the only thing that 's prepared there . <sssss> anyhow , the soup itself is simple but good . <sssss> it 's basically ravioli squares stuffed with beef in a broth with a sort of grass . <sssss> very filling . <sssss> again , my friend ordered some kebabs with rice and onions . <sssss> ----------------------------- just like another reviewer said , you will be full for hours . <sssss> we will be going back to samarkand later on . <sssss> -lrb- if you are wondering about price , my friend and myself spent $ 15 - $ 17 each , both times there . -rrb- <sssss> i recommend it because the food is good and filling and besides , how many other russian-uzbeki joints have you seen around town ? <sssss> none right ? <sssss> then here you have the opportunity to experience a culinary rarity . <sssss> and if a tough nail like mike tyson likes it , then you know it must be good . <sssss> and besides , you would n't want to disagree with mike 's choice ; we know what happens when someone has a disagreement with him . <sssss> just watch the news . <sssss> it 's not pretty . 
5		i love this place , we have had many great dinners here over the years . <sssss> i think only once was i kind of upset eating here . <sssss> it had nothing to do with the food or service , it was the crowd ! <sssss> what do you expect though ? <sssss> even a japanese tour bus stopped by and all were very pleased with the menu and food . <sssss> i am in the bay area and the owner always recognizes us and comes over to chat . <sssss> also i love the saltwater tanks with the exotic fish swimming around . 
5		after multiple visits and having tried their other offerings , i 'm upgrading my rating of cornish pasty co to five stars . <sssss> last night it turned out my eyes were bigger than my stomach and i could n't even touch dessert -lrb- the very appropriately named strawberry pavlova -rrb- until this morning ; a porky and mushy peas was all i needed for 12 hours straight . <sssss> my new life goal is to eat one of everything cornish pasty makes . <sssss> i might die in the process , but i 'll die happy . 
5		excellent italian food ! <sssss> the gnocchi is the best with the cream sauce ... so good ! <sssss> escargot and calamari are wonderful as well . <sssss> the service is awesome ! <sssss> old fashioned customer service that 's hard to find nowadays . <sssss> mine and my 6 year old daughter 's favorite place to eat ! <sssss> ... which says alot . 
5		ok , there 's not much i can say that over 150 reviews have n't already said ... so i 'll keep this brief . <sssss> tasty hummus and pita - check delicious gyro sandwich - check -lrb- pickle was new to me but tasty -rrb- amazingly good lil baklava treats - check great prices - check check check -lrb- under $ 10 a person -rrb- you get the picture ... everything was delicious and prices are super . <sssss> i have a feeling that this will be a new regular joint for the roomie and me . <sssss> we love great food at great prices . <sssss> -lrb- and the baklava alone is reason to stop in for a quick treat - even if you 're not hungry ! -rrb- <sssss> see ya there ! 
5		so i decided that this friday night i was skipping the classic rotation of drift , junkie and philly cheese steaks for dinner with a good friend . <sssss> originally we were heading to blanco -lrb- which i was not stoked about -rrb- . <sssss> i got blanco at 7:45 and there was an hour wait for 2 people . <sssss> my friend was running late so i launched my handy iphone yelp app and looked up the j. alexander 's reviews . <sssss> five minutes later my friend showed up and we were walking into j. alexanders . <sssss> from the start i did feel the comparison to bandera and houston 's however i felt like j.a was much more open . <sssss> the hostess was very friendly and sat us right away . <sssss> here is what sealed the 5 star rating , the service . <sssss> our server was named ryan and he was on point . <sssss> he was quick to the table to ask us for our drink order of which he recommended a medium bodied pinot noir . <sssss> he then took our whole food order . <sssss> i was a little nervous about that but he timed the food perfectly which allowed for a mainly uninterrupted dinner . <sssss> the only time he bothered us was to refill our glass -lrb- which never bothers me -rrb- and clean our table . <sssss> i had the filet medium with mashed potatoes . <sssss> the steak was great and cooked to perfection . <sssss> my friend kate had the prime rib , rare . <sssss> now i think it was cooked well ... actually not sure here it came out so bloody i thought it was still mooing but she enjoyed it . <sssss> we finished the meal with one of the best pieces of carrot cake i have ever had , i do n't even like carrot cake . <sssss> it is n't your typical carrot cake it comes out warm with melted icing which tastes similar to the icing found on a cinna-bun cinnamon roll . <sssss> all in all i would highly recommend ja . <sssss> the service , food and atmosphere were great ! 
5		a favorite everytime i am in town ... lemony feta fries are awesome . <sssss> gyro salad never disappoints . <sssss> i highly recommend this place for fresh , delicious food . 
5		if you like authentic sushi -lrb- i.e. not crazy rolls where you ca n't taste the freshness of the fish -rrb- , sit at the sushi bar and let the chef know . <sssss> he 'll hook you up with some out of the world food that you wo n't forget . <sssss> they have the best selection of fish in town and amazing variety of condiments from japan , including fresh wasabi root that 's grated to order . 
5		this was a charming hotel . <sssss> the front desk employees were very accommodating as we found out our a/c went out while we were away on vacation . <sssss> it was late at night and we were very panicked . <sssss> the rooms were very spacious and updated with a fridge and a microwave . <sssss> the bed was very comfortable . <sssss> the breakfast was above average compared to other best westerns that our family has stayed at . <sssss> it is in a great location and easy to get to both the chandler mall and to downtown chandler and even the san tan mall in gilbert . <sssss> if we should have friends that need a place to stay we will definitely recommend this hotel ! 
5		this hidden gem is the best place to eat on mill ave. seriously good bbq ! <sssss> staff really explains each item well and gets you excited about what you are going to eat . <sssss> they are super friendly too . <sssss> the brisket is soooo amazing it melts in your mouth . <sssss> i get the moist brisket , side of coleslaw , bun , and the spicy bbq . <sssss> i put it all on together on the bun ... and for those few minutes i 'm in heaven . <sssss> seriously try it ... sooo good . <sssss> i 'm hooked . <sssss> i 've eaten there pretty much everyday since they opened . <sssss> cheers ! 
5		this place was excellent . <sssss> nice ambiance and a great happy hour . <sssss> the kids menu was nice and the honey chicken was a huge portion and delicious . <sssss> -lrb- i almost do n't want to divulge this secret but ... next time you want honey chicken from pei wei , just come here and get the $ 4.99 kids meal . -rrb- <sssss> we liked everything we got ; arizona roll , crazy shrimp roll , jalapeno roll , and crunch roll . <sssss> my favorite was arizona roll . <sssss> the wife enjoyed the sea weed salad as well . <sssss> everything was very tasty and fresh ! <sssss> i 'm usually not a huge sushi person but this place may have changed me and i will definitely be back here . 
5		omg !!!! <sssss> i am not a fan of yogurt at all ... but my oatmeal cookie mixed with strawberry was the most amazing dessert ever ! <sssss> -lrb- well , not ever , but my goodness was this great !!! -rrb- <sssss> what a great way to finish an evening . <sssss> i was tired from my workout and just finished a great meal at bloom when i suggested yogurt builderz . <sssss> my friend thought i had the most magical idea ever and off we went ! <sssss> i have friends that swear by this place and go here at least 3 times a week , so i had to try it . <sssss> and the prices are n't too shabby either . <sssss> and they have a great assortment of toppings ... though i do wish they were labeled a little bit better . <sssss> and while experiencing this amazing place ... my other friends stopped by as well . <sssss> one had the marshmallow with marshmallow sauce and the other the devils food . <sssss> -lrb- which i did have a sample of ... good , but it seemed like it was missing something ... probably calories and fat ! -rrb- <sssss> but i heard that they do n't have oatmeal cookie everyday ... :-lrb- i hope it 's there the next time i go . 
5		after scouring high and low for the perfect bike , i finally found it here . <sssss> aside from the good price they gave me , the service was really great . <sssss> a guy named adam helped me out and he was really friendly and knowledgeable about all the question i had to throw at him . <sssss> overall , they have a pretty wide selection of bikes which is nice to see because every bike store in phoenix seems to only sell beach cruiser types or mountain bikes . <sssss> as far as accessories go , you can find pretty much anything you 're looking for here from locks to a horn for your handle bar . <sssss> another great reason to buy from here is that if you get a bike , you get one free tune-up whenever you want to come back in . <sssss> come here for the perfect bike , perfect service , and perfect selection of what they have to offer . 
5		ok , so phoenix has a lot of consignment shops , but this is the first one i 've seen that sticks to outdoor gear and attire . <sssss> despite the simplicity of the buy , sell , consign idea , this outfit has a lot of nice stuff and matt is super easy to work with . <sssss> he 's an honest guy with a great personality plus the business and outdoor knowledge to make this a success . <sssss> it 's finally nice to meet a serious cyclist and shop owner in az that does not have the `` elitist '' attitude . <sssss> matt is pretty laid back , polite , and humble . <sssss> onto the merchandise . <sssss> if you 're into the reduce , reuse , recycle idea this is your place . <sssss> if you 're into new stuff , this is also your place . <sssss> the two times visiting the shop , i have found gear and books for cycling , skiing , kayaking , camping , hiking , and more . <sssss> obviously matt stocks more used items because that is the business model , but you can find some quality new cycle clothing and parts . <sssss> here is also where the beauty of the shop exists , every time you visit salvation outdoors there is going to be new gear and inventory that could be perfect for your next adventure . <sssss> do n't quote me on this , but my guess is that matt also has the ability to order new items from suppliers . <sssss> one area that i will definitely mention is the bike service . <sssss> matt has all the tools to do simple repairs or major overhauls . <sssss> he was reworking a bottom bracket the first time i stopped in . <sssss> the prices he mentioned for both services are reasonable and even a little less then i 've seen at other shops in town . <sssss> across the board , prices are very fair and i noticed some downright bargains while perusing . <sssss> pictures just do n't do this place justice . <sssss> if you 're in the neighborhood , do yourself a favor and stop in for 15 minutes . <sssss> you might just find what you 're looking for . <sssss> looking forward to see if any groups begin using salvation outdoors as their safe haven to kicking off week night and weekend group exercise events . <sssss> if anyone in the neighborhood is interested in starting a meetup here , shoot me a message and we 'll get something in the books . 
5		i started my relationship with metta community yoga as a student attending classes taught by cathy , lara and lindsey . <sssss> i loved the casual atmosphere and beautiful practice they provided . <sssss> i am a certified yoga instructor and just could n't resist approaching them to get a class of my own on their schedule . <sssss> i have been teaching and taking classes at metta for almost two years now and always encourage everyone i know to check them out . <sssss> there is yoga for almost everyone offered there . <sssss> they have a great , full schedule of classes so no matter what your other activities look like , you can find time to take a class at metta . <sssss> my 8 year old daughter as well as my 3-9 year old nieces and nephews have gone yoga crazy at regina 's kids ' yoga class offered once a week at metta ! <sssss> it 's is so lovely to see children take an interest in such a beautiful art and metta makes it fun and accessible to kids . <sssss> this is my first review on yelp and i could n't be happier that i can praise metta . <sssss> go see for yourself ! 
5		best sandwiches ! 
5		i really like this movie theatre - it 's in a great location inside of tempe marketplace , it 's nice and clean , and they have a good number of movies playing at once . <sssss> the harkins loyalty cup is great too , buy it once for $ 5 or so and get unlimited $ 1 refills for an entire year . <sssss> great marketing tool and i love that you can bring a reusable cup . 
5		wanted to try this place after reading a long article in the az republic about the place . <sssss> my only initial concern was is this going to be an authentic place or some hipster wan na be establishment . <sssss> in the article the owner wanted to expand -lrb- money -rrb- but talked about knowing all his customers in an intimate way . <sssss> kinda had me worried . <sssss> dont really like talking to people unless they are authentic about it . <sssss> the place looks great , real industrial feel . <sssss> lots of room and different decor which is probably by design . <sssss> variety of people too from tree huggers , businessman , moms with tots and a gay crowd . <sssss> pretty cool . <sssss> good coffee , very average scone . <sssss> great service . <sssss> enjoyed hanging out for a couple of hours . <sssss> even saw the owner and he didnt approach anyone . <sssss> he 's hard not to notice . <sssss> he 's got the cool guy glasses and hipster pants on . <sssss> must have read some serious shakespeare that day . <sssss> looking forward to checking out the drinks and food at night . 
5		i 've been to bombay spice before and i 've always loved their food , it 's delicious , tasty and the service has always been wonderful . <sssss> i went their recently with friends during yelp eats and was able to have a full menu with wonderful prices . 
5		if only more restaurants could be like aunt chilada 's . <sssss> i 'm happy that i have been able to visit several times and look forward to many more visits in the future ! <sssss> first of all , this place is oozing with history . <sssss> did you know that long before arizona was even a state , this establishment used to be a brothel ? <sssss> yes , a brothel ! <sssss> well now , it 's of course the furthest thing from a brothel but you can still feel the history living in the walls and parts of the restaurant feel like stepping into a different decade all together . <sssss> second of all , the environment . <sssss> if there 's a restaurant that screams party , this is it and i 'm talking about a party for all ages . <sssss> whether you 're visiting with family and looking for a lively establishment with plenty of patio seating , fun games and hearty food , or you 're out with friends eager to share some laughs over margaritas , live music and trivia night , this restaurant 's got your covered . <sssss> this is the ideal restaurant for large parties , private parties and more . <sssss> they have two very large patios with two outdoor bars , a huge indoor bar area , a spacious main dining room and a more private dining room in the back -lrb- that happens to be the original building that housed the brothel ! -rrb- <sssss> third , let 's talk about the activities . <sssss> this restaurant knows how to keep their guests entertained ! <sssss> they have live music , trivia nights , bocce ball tournaments , chocolate fountains on sundays , and special events including a fiesta bash on cinco de mayo ... just to name a few . <sssss> fourth and finally , the food . <sssss> the food is solid americanized mexican food . <sssss> the nachos are hefty , the pollo fundido is cheesy & creamy and the quesadillas are a good greasy -lrb- the kind you want when eating a quesadilla -rrb- . <sssss> this food is exactly what i would expect and hope for when visiting aunt chilada 's . <sssss> it 's the perfect type of food for this family-friendly , fiesta inspired establishment . <sssss> ps - did you know that these fine folks also happen to own rustlers rooste ... that awesome cowboy establishment in tempe complete with a live bull , slide and two stepping ? <sssss> yes , these folks know how to have fun ! 
5		i 've been going to beautif-eye since i moved to scottsdale two years ago for threading -lrb- eyebrow and upper lip -rrb- . <sssss> having lived in india and been threaded in dubai , you can say i have high standards for shaping , threading technique , and have a hard time paying more than $ 2 for something i know costs .20 cents in other places . <sssss> however , mercie -lrb- co-owner -rrb- is friendly , and kind , and the receptionists always find time to squeeze you in , whether you call and need an appointment that day , or just show up during your lunch break -lrb- which i do sometimes -rrb- . <sssss> marina and tori are absolute pros , and you will not regret coming here ! <sssss> -lrb- plus they have a first-time special for new customers , and their prices are pretty good for the us -rrb- . 
5		love this place . <sssss> i hit it about once a month to avoid giving all my hard earned $ $ to big shops like bass pro , etc. . <sssss> there 's plenty of high end gear , and a pretty good selection of terminal and soft baits . <sssss> the best thing about this shop is the old school vibe . <sssss> there are usually a few older guys sitting up front , -lrb- not employees -rrb- reading newspapers , talking trash , etc. . <sssss> kind of a barber shop deal . <sssss> also , if you want some help , and an almost guaranteed laugh , ask jeep for help . <sssss> the dude totally knows his fishing , and he 's got a wry sense of humor , which he never fails to break out on me . <sssss> also , when he 's ringing up my items , he nonchalantly knocks 10-15 % off of everything i 'm buying , which does n't suck at all . <sssss> great local business , great people , totally legit . <sssss> ca n't believe there are n't more reviews on here . <sssss> 5 stars . <sssss> time to go fishing now ... 
5		we went twice in one week . <sssss> after hearing about this place from coworkers i had to try . <sssss> i do n't recall what we ordered as we just asked the super sweet waitress to bring us sampling of her favorite dishes . <sssss> spice was just right and the flavor is delightfully foreign . <sssss> a must try ! 
5		went for a little day trip with the girlfriend to lake pleasant a couple of weeks ago . <sssss> after our adventure we decided to head into wickenburg for some lunch . <sssss> we stopped into horseshoe cafe about 20 min before closing time and were greeted with warm welcome by the friendly and comical staff . <sssss> i had the biscuits and sausage gravy and let me just say it was amazing !!! <sssss> i am pretty picky when it comes to this delicious breakfast comfort food and i rank it up there with the best . <sssss> the gf had a patty melt which looked delicious and according to her was pretty darn good . <sssss> all in all we had a delicious meal and sat there for some time after just conversing with the few regulars that were in there and the staff that so graciously served us at the last minute . <sssss> whenever i find myself in the area i will be back !!! <sssss> i highly recommend you check it out and treat yourself to a great inexpensive meal and enjoy some fantastic conversation with the folks that work and eat there . 
5		upon my second visit to lobby 's i tried the italian beef sandwich . <sssss> wow ! <sssss> go hungry if you 're gon na get this one cause it is huge ! <sssss> and it 's really more of a knife and fork sandwich . <sssss> oh sure , you can try to eat it like a sandwich but you 're probably going to be picking up a lot of the filling with your fork so just cut it up and get every bite the first time . <sssss> the beef is so tender and tasty ! <sssss> yum ! <sssss> . <sssss> let me speak about customer service for a moment . <sssss> i love being treated like a valued customer . <sssss> if i 'm going to spend my hard earned cash somewhere i want a smile , willingness to help if i have questions , and getting my order correct . <sssss> if they do that right then they are tops in my book . <sssss> the last two weeks i have gone to two establishments that not only did all these things but they remembered me by name ! <sssss> when i walked into lobby 's for lunch last week i was greated warmly by lobby himself and he remembered me ! <sssss> it 's been a while since i was last in and i know he sees people all day long and i 'm not what i would call particularly memorable ... i mean i do n't have tats or pink hair , i 'm just your average woman but lobby goes that extra mile . <sssss> he really cares about his business and it shows . <sssss> there were some gentleman just finishing off their lunches and he took the time to ask them how it was and listened to their critique of the food . <sssss> he did it graciously and asked some questions genuinely wanted to know the answers . <sssss> lobby cares . <sssss> his place is still spotless , again , a big plus for me . <sssss> when i crave a burger , this is what i crave . <sssss> a real beef patty with fresh ingrediants , cheese , and sometimes bacon . <sssss> this is by far my favorite burger joint . <sssss> support your locan businesses !! <sssss> especially the ones that go that extra mile and really care !!! 
5		beep ... beep ... beep ... flat line ______________________________________________ what do you do when your bike dies ... take it to rage cycles ! <sssss> i have to say i love this place . <sssss> for one , it 's privately owned , and secondly all the employees are super cool , laid back , and very helpful . <sssss> they know their bicycle mythology well . <sssss> walking into rage , you feel right at home , and comfortable even if you are an amateur rider . <sssss> many places like this would make the average biker feel like an outcast , or a sell out , because you have a `` real job '' , but not rage . <sssss> they are just simply cool . <sssss> if you have a problem , yo they 'll solve it , and for a decent price . <sssss> i have taken my mountain bike here twice for service , and both times i had it back in a week , tip top shape , and it did n't put a dent in my wallet . <sssss> they have plenty of custom bikes to look at and tons of parts , accessories , and all the equipment any biker would need , whether you have a street , mountain , or whatever bike . <sssss> i highly recommend rage for all your bicycle needs , parking is in the rear , and they are open until 7pm most days . <sssss> it 's not the easiest place to find , but it 's worth looking for if you have bike trouble . 
5		i love soma !! <sssss> everything is so healthy here - you feel so good after eating here . <sssss> everything on their menu has the calories quoted for you - how great is that ? <sssss> all of their salad dressings have no oil - i just love their philosophy towards diet/nutrition / health & wellness . <sssss> it makes everything taste better = 0 -rrb- 
5		their pizza is so awesome ! <sssss> try the meatball and the big star pizza . <sssss> plus they have the best beer ever ! <sssss> and also , customer service is 5 star . 
5		service was great , the place was kept really neat and clean . <sssss> and the food is authentic . <sssss> great place to eat after a hangover or lunch . 
5		i absolutely agree with john k. i have just recently discovered this place and am glad that i did . <sssss> when all other big no character chains stores were out of a beer i was looking for , they were able to help me out . <sssss> letting me know that they had what i was looking for within a short while after posting the question to them on facebook . <sssss> once i arrived they even let me know that they had what i wanted in the cooler section as i was grabbing some off of the shelf . <sssss> not to mention , they even went and grabbed it out of the cooler for me . <sssss> great selection of craft beer and also growler fills with empty growlers on-site . <sssss> this has now become my go to spot for my craft beer needs . 
5		ordered a perforated union jack for my sunroof . <sssss> fast freindly service , quick shipping and still looks good 3 years later . <sssss> highly recommend this merchant 
5		oh my gosh ! <sssss> i was so sick after i left this place , but it had nothing to do with bad food ... i ca n't believe how fast they got our food out , piping hot , and for an awesome price . <sssss> $ 5 for lunch ? <sssss> yes , please . <sssss> i ate way too much . 
5		fun little place to just explore and try so many different samplings . <sssss> the staff was great and super friendly ! <sssss> the lemon cupcakes were amazing !!! <sssss> little tip : buy a baguette to try all the great olive oils and tapenades 
5		came in here not knowing what to expect . <sssss> my family was hungry and we left stuffed and content ! <sssss> the service was excellent ! <sssss> very friendly server and manager . <sssss> we were very pleased : -rrb- 
5		second trip was as awesome as the first !!! <sssss> we tried the eggs benedict , quiche of the day , and biscuits and gravy and wow is the only way to describe the food . <sssss> it was all great , but the biscuit and gravy was unbelievable !!! <sssss> a definite must if you are a biscuit fan . <sssss> the service was wonderful and the environment is perfect . <sssss> come by if you want excellent food and a great time 
5		wow , i do n't even know where to begin with this one . <sssss> i have stayed in many different kinds of hotels , both good and bad , in many locations but i have to say that truly my stay at the hermosa inn was one of the best i 've ever had from start to finish . <sssss> first of all , my husband and i booked the hotel on hotwire which is always a gamble because you do n't know where you 're going to stay , just the star rating , location and price . <sssss> we got an absolutely slamming deal for this hotel but it is still definitely worth the advertised price . <sssss> even upon pulling up to the inn , my husband and i knew we were in for a treat . <sssss> beautiful landscaping in a quiet area . <sssss> check-in was very personal , with the very friendly gentlemen walking us to our casita and telling us a bit about the hotel . <sssss> we were even more excited when we got to our room and saw how comfortable we were going to be for our stay : a california king bed with an actual wooden frame , big squishy pillows , a huge bathroom with walk-in shower , and a private patio about 10 feet from a hot tub . <sssss> the pool was just a short walk away and we swam both nights we were there . <sssss> we loved the accomodations and i can not say enough good things about them . <sssss> there is a restaurant in the hotel that we wanted to try but did n't get a chance to since we were in town only a few short nights . <sssss> it did seem a little pricey , but also very upscale and appropriate for the hotel . <sssss> if we were to return we would definitely give it a try , especially because the patio setting for it looked so beautiful . <sssss> overall , i think it 's obvious that i loved loved loved the hermosa inn . <sssss> i highly recommend staying here , either for a visit or even an overnight staycation if you live in the area . <sssss> it is worth every penny and you wo n't want to go home ! 
5		best bean burros and tortillas in town ! <sssss> been eating at carolinas for years 
5		we had breakfast there recently . <sssss> i had the iron skillet and it was such a cool dish . <sssss> such a creative presentation , if nothing else . <sssss> two years ago we had dinner there and i remember it really knocked our socks off , though i do n't remember enough of that meal to provide details . <sssss> the view at this place is second to none , to say the least , whether on a clear day , at sunset , or at night . <sssss> as someone else already said , it is a nice crowd there , and the decor is very tastefully done . 
5		one of the most incredible space in downtown phoenix . <sssss> always a delightful experience . <sssss> this last art detour -lrb- 2008 -rrb- , on the second floor i saw two ghosts . <sssss> so that was pretty awesome . <sssss> my boyfriend opened the door and then closed it and i said let 's go in there . <sssss> he said there was nothing in there . <sssss> i said i saw two people walking . <sssss> i really did . <sssss> he opened the door and in the back of the room , i saw a light and two people walking . <sssss> we opened the door again , and it was pitch black and empty . <sssss> totally freaky ! 
5		i love this place , they have good beer and there artichoke dip is great . <sssss> good place to sit back eat and enjoy the atmosphere . 
5		this is one of the nicest restaurant you can find in ahwatukee close to the busy i10 and chandler blvd. . <sssss> wether you just stop by during happy hour or have a succulent supper try it . 
5		i took my gf here before a suns game . <sssss> the server was very knowledgeable . <sssss> the cheese plate was great but a bit pricey . <sssss> some salad w / fruit and boiled chicken was tasty according to the princess . <sssss> bleu cheese mac n cheese was amazing . <sssss> go eat here tonight . 
5		went last night to celebrate my birthday with 6 other friends and family . <sssss> first of all , i want to apologize to the other patrons that were sitting near us because after 4 of their wonderful chocolate martinis i probably was pretty loud too.i was n't wearing a hat though . <sssss> the food was wonderful as always especially since we started with the dessert and went from there . <sssss> jeremy also was our server and he could n't have been more adorable.after i got my birthday hug i personally do n't think he plays on any other team then the girls. :-rrb- -rrb- the staff made the whole experience even more enjoyable for me . <sssss> thank you . <sssss> thank you thank you to the whole melting pot crew 
5		went in this morning for breakfast with my husband and daughter . <sssss> glad we arrive before 10 am because the restaurant filled up pretty quickly after that time . <sssss> i had the green flannel hash -- amazing . <sssss> a terrific portion and super tasty . <sssss> the dollop of sour cream is perfect to cool the spice of the jalapenos . <sssss> i do n't generally order a more savory meal for breakfast , generally preferring french toast or pancakes , but the green flannel hash is a must have at orange table . <sssss> my daughter enjoyed her pancake , scrambled eggs and a slice of bacon . <sssss> just the right size for a hungry nine-year-old . <sssss> she ate her entire meal . <sssss> i snagged a bit of her bacon and it was awesome ! <sssss> thick cut and cooked to perfection . <sssss> she also had a hot chocolate . <sssss> no thin , out-of-a-machine beverage -- the real deal with chocolate and whole milk . <sssss> an indulgence ! <sssss> my husband loved his garlic and mushroom omelet . <sssss> he asked to have spinach added to which our waiter replied , `` sure . <sssss> no problem ! '' <sssss> his omelet arrived with a really nice helping of spinach included . <sssss> my husband replied that he 's not always a fan of omelets but he wanted to give this one a try . <sssss> it was cooked to perfection -- not too thick and eggy but a nice , three-egg portion , not overdone in any way . <sssss> the mushroom sherry sauce on top was a great touch . <sssss> we both had sourdough toast which was incredible ! <sssss> our meal kept us going through a long busy day of shopping and errands . <sssss> can hardly wait to go back ! 
5		i am happy that they carry the pac 12 network ! 
5		i 'm used to going to brunch after 1pm so i guess you really could n't call it brunch . <sssss> i had just gotten out of church when i received a phone call from my best friend w . <sssss> he asked if i want to go eat at windsor . <sssss> i had never been to windsor and , of course i complained because i did n't think they were going to give me enough food to fill me up . <sssss> remember , i am a fatboy trapped in a skinny mans body . <sssss> he promised i would n't be disappointed . <sssss> as we pulled up to windsor , my first impression as we walked in the door was wow . <sssss> i feel in love with the way the place was set up . <sssss> as we sat down , a friendly waitress came and took our drink and appetizer order . <sssss> she brought the drinks but she never brought the appetizers . <sssss> then she came back and took our order . <sssss> she brought out our food but never brought out the appetizers . <sssss> we asked about the appetizers and she said she was so sorry and brought over her manager . <sssss> the manager told us she was sorry for the mishap and would comp our bill $ 17.00 since they forgot to put in our appetizers . <sssss> i could n't believe this place . <sssss> it was like heaven . <sssss> needless to say , my meal left me full and satisfied . <sssss> the service was great . <sssss> the atmosphere was wonderful , and the staff was amazing . <sssss> i think i have found my new spot every sunday afternoon after church . 
5		this location is cool because they have internet and outlets and its not busy so i did my hw in peace and quiet ! <sssss> and the girl with the glasses hooked it up with the value $ 1 fries yum ! 
5		it 's big and open with tons of stuff that is fairly decent . <sssss> it 's clean and bright too . <sssss> the best part ? <sssss> clothing is organized by both size and color !!! <sssss> i love when thrift stores take the time to do this , it makes my shopping experience so much more enjoyable . 
5		best fresh pumpkin ice cream i 've ever had ! <sssss> it 's a cute shop chock full of goodies for kids of all ages . <sssss> enthusiastic staff bring you the most yummy dessert you could ever hope for . <sssss> there is limited outside seating available in the back where you can savor every spoonful . 
5		best pho in town , period !!! 
5		i do n't understand low ratings for a chick-fil-a . <sssss> they make the same thing everywhere and it 's consistantly the same and good . <sssss> love it . <sssss> never had stale food or unfriendly service . 
5		i seriously think i am in a sugar coma tonight ! <sssss> a night indulging in giant cookies -lrb- the peanut butter cookie was my fave -rrb- , cakes , cupcakes , pastries goodies , gelato -lrb- yummy peach gelato -rrb- , freshly made english muffins , champagne , coffee , and much , much more . <sssss> you can taste until your heart 's content . <sssss> oh my ! <sssss> if that was n't enough , we all left with more delicious goodies in a gift bag . <sssss> kudos to lindsey , yelp , & lgo ! <sssss> look forward to try other delious goodies from the bake shop . 
5		brushetta and wine omg enough said . <sssss> . <sssss> great wine selection chill atmosphere = perfect !!! 
5		wonderful place , and the best part is the drinks . <sssss> i 'd never had anything like them . <sssss> the menu is creative , and i was introduced to fingerling potatoes , which you need to get ! <sssss> believe me , they 'll have you searching the internet for a recipe that can somehow , perhaps , just maybe , certainly hopefully , come close to matching the wonderment in a plate . <sssss> and get the pork chili verde . <sssss> mmmmmm !!! 
5		this is the type of public house every neighborhood needs . <sssss> we just stopped in for a beer and a snack . <sssss> we found an atmosphere that is inviting , open and kind of quirky . <sssss> a nice selection of beers that include not only their own kettle creations but well thought out local -lrb- guest -rrb- tap offerings . <sssss> for my kindred spirits that enjoy a little bread to go with their beer i must recommend the pretzel , they where fantastic with the esb . <sssss> we also tried the wings and i will tell you they are not from buffalo . <sssss> they are marinated , grilled , tender and the most refreshing flavor i have sampled on chicken in a long time . 
5		the boyfriend and i wanted pizza for dinner , and a quick yelp search showed a highly-rated pizza place practically across the street ... there was n't even a second thought . <sssss> and we were not disappointed ! <sssss> we had a margherita pizza and coke , and got out of there full and happy for less than $ 15 . <sssss> service was good ; they were n't very busy and the server was attentive and available . <sssss> the restaurant had a good `` pizza joint '' vibe . <sssss> the banquet room off to the side looks like it would be a great area for large groups or parties . <sssss> there was a lot more on the menu i 'd like to try , everything looked great . <sssss> definitely going back ! 
5		this place is amazing for breakfast !!! <sssss> seriously $ 3 for a huge plate of eggs , toast and home-style potatoes . <sssss> such an awkward location but i think that makes eating here even more fun . <sssss> great owners , very friendly ! 
5		our party of 6 was served very quickly by the kitchen staff and our server was very attentive . <sssss> i look forward to coming back soon , i had the large `` p2 '' with spring rolls and hot tea . <sssss> my soup was solid , spring rolls perfect size , and tea was hot . <sssss> the price was affordable , i am happy that a good pho place is so close to home . <sssss> i will certainly be bringing my family back soon . 
5		ever been in a spice store ? <sssss> it 's like walking into your favorite kitchen and smelling all your favorite foods being cooked at once . <sssss> we had been ordering from a catalog for some time and did n't know that they actually had stores . <sssss> then one day we were visiting the phoenix area and discovered this store . <sssss> first time we came in we had n't a clue what we needed . <sssss> we soon learned to make our list and each time we hit the phoenix area , we know what to pick up . <sssss> it 's one of the best spice markets we 've seen . <sssss> be sure to allow enough time to browse , pick up some of their free recipes and their magazines are loaded with ideas . 
5		i love lux ! <sssss> i spend every weekend drinking the weirdest , but most amazing , drink combination in the world -- a caffe latte and a bloody mary . <sssss> jake makes the best bloody marys i 've ever had . <sssss> exceptional service , food/drink/coffee quality , price and atmosphere . <sssss> i could n't ask for more from the coffee shop down the street from my apt . <sssss> it 's my home away from home -- i do n't know where i would spend my weekend mornings -lrb- which always end up turning into the evening ! -rrb- <sssss> w/o lux ! <sssss> and i used to hate bloody marys !!!!! <sssss> bacon as a garnish ?? <sssss> pure genius . <sssss> you get nothing but the best from lux every time . <sssss> everyone i take there is blown away . <sssss> it 's just a pure gem . 
5		i have been with regus in phoenix for over five years . <sssss> this company and the staff are phenomenal ! <sssss> they are attentive to my business needs while maintaing a beautiful office space . <sssss> for a profesional staff , image and office at a high powered address regus is the way to go . 
5		i was not very impressed by the looks of this non-descript arcadia restaurant located in a strip mall . <sssss> however , on the inside its modern , bright and inviting with excellent service and very very good modern mexican food . <sssss> the chips are perfection ... also try the heavenly habanero-raspberry margarita ! <sssss> - you 're welcome !!! 
5		these guys are the best . <sssss> i work for the state , basically across the street from them . <sssss> they 've fixed tires for me for free , and never gouged me on any other work . <sssss> and , they are super nice -lrb- all of them ! -rrb- <sssss> to boot ! 
5		i absolutely love dr. labranche i have been her patient since 2005 and could n't see myself with anyone else . <sssss> she is a specialist so her prices are higher but she is well worth it . <sssss> i have 3 children and she has delivered 2 and we are now working on our 4th . <sssss> the office staff is very friendly . <sssss> this is not an office where you would find 5 doctors and never know which one you will have . <sssss> there is 1 doctor 1 m.a. and 2 ladies up front . <sssss> sometimes the doc will be called in for a delivery or c-sec and i have to reschedule my appt . <sssss> but i do n't mind it just shows that if i have a problem she will be there for me . <sssss> and she is right next door to the hospital which is awesome . 
5		i have been a loyal customer of exclusively men 's for 6 years . <sssss> sam 's focus is on customer service & this emphasis is what keeps me coming back . <sssss> this is a family run business with the look of all the v but none of the attitude . <sssss> i tried the royal shave today for the first time & i am hooked . <sssss> i recommend this barber shop/spa to everyone . <sssss> see you next week sam . 
5		one of those great `` best kept secret '' kind of places . <sssss> food is exceptional and the service was great . <sssss> quaint with great ambiance . 
5		this place is pretty amazing . <sssss> very attentive staff . <sssss> not to mention the food -lrb- locally grown -rrb- was delicious and tasted fresh and homemade . <sssss> we got in a little early and was advised that a soup was being made but would not be ready for 30 minutes -lrb- since it was made fresh -rrb- . <sssss> i waited and was absolutely blown away by the flavor . <sssss> definitely worth it . <sssss> and we got to munch on some delicious tortilla chips with 4 salsa choices ... all were great . <sssss> my friend had the pollo asado , and though i did n't taste it , he loved it -lrb- and i also observed it falling off the bone . <sssss> and they do n't make a bad marguerita either . <sssss> a gem . <sssss> was thoroughly impressed and glad to have happened upon it . <sssss> i will be back to this place . 
5		this place is fantastic . <sssss> but do n't expect to just find asian food , they have so much more ! <sssss> i always leave with much more than i planned on . <sssss> great german and russian beer selection ! 
5		i love this place ! <sssss> so much unique stuff ! <sssss> i always find things to buy ! 
5		smooth rich tasting gelato . <sssss> the flavors are more creamy-based rather than fruit based , and they have a few unusual flavors such as pine nut . <sssss> they also have a selection of chocolates , cannolis , and various italian cookies to choose from . 
5		i absolutely love this place ! <sssss> i went with two co-workers last night -lrb- wednesday -rrb- and it was ladies night ! <sssss> one dollar well drinks til midnight ! <sssss> i drank 4 in about 30 minutes and was drunk . <sssss> the inside is beautiful . <sssss> i love the setup and the lights . <sssss> the staff were all very friendly and welcoming . <sssss> some of the dancers were eh , not very pretty or very good dancers . <sssss> one even told a bouncer i was taking pictures -lrb- which i was n't -rrb- he was n't rude when he approached me . <sssss> some of the girls were amazing . <sssss> dances are only 10 bucks . <sssss> i spent a total of only 20 bucks or so . <sssss> definitely worth it . <sssss> i 'll be going back very soon . <sssss> oh , did i mention wednesday is also amature night ? <sssss> you can win 500 bucks by dancing on stage for 30 seconds . <sssss> the audience picks the winner . <sssss> it was a good time . <sssss> i 'm thinking about maybe trying it next week . 
5		great place for gourmet burgers . <sssss> i would recommend ordering 1 burger and sharing it . <sssss> we got the sweet and spicy burger & the peppercornned burger . <sssss> i personally liked the peppercorned much better . <sssss> it had the right amount of smoke in it and tasted like a really good freshly grilled backyard burger . 
5		a sign of any good bbq place , in my book , is how the beef brisket is done . <sssss> joe 's brisket is right on . <sssss> thick sliced with a nice pink smoke ring and burnt edges . <sssss> accompanied by the thin tangy sauce , it makes for a solid bbq experience . <sssss> i tried out the sampler plate complete with ribs , brisket , pulled pork and smoked chicken . <sssss> everything had a distinct smokey flavor and while it was good bbq , nothing stood out as fantastic . <sssss> the dry slice of herbed bread did n't add much either as it was a strange contrast to the sweet smokey meat . <sssss> side dishes i tried were just average - the slaw and sweet corn were decent if not a touch bland while the beans and potato salad earn high marks for their savory flavors . <sssss> altogether i have to say i 'm a fan of the meat , but the side dishes-not so much . <sssss> but hey , who goes to a bbq joint for the sides anyway ! <sssss> update : after dining in , i 'm now a true believer . <sssss> jalapeno turkey sausage and fresh lemonade alone warrant 5 stars , and the service was fantastic . <sssss> all the fresh side dishes i tried were solid . <sssss> i 'll write off the negative comments above to the fact i got take out that time . <sssss> the atmosphere , with its down home , communal feel also lent to a great bbq experience . <sssss> and the beef brisket was still phenomenal . 
5		we were in best buy today needing help from the geek squad . <sssss> we found them to be efficient & best of all they did n't charge for the diagnostics !! 
5		delux is always really good , fresh , and it 's a clean place too ! <sssss> i love the beet salad with chicken added . <sssss> it 's delish ! <sssss> my man digs the burgers and we both scarf the sweet potato fries . <sssss> love their dipping sauce that comes next to the ketchup , ah-mazing ! 
5		love it here ! <sssss> family favorite , we always meet here and bring people when they are visiting from out of town . <sssss> mercedes was so sweet and such a great waitress to have . <sssss> the other girls were cute too ! 
5		i live in the neighborhood and a few months back was wondering why there were all of these cars late at night by this little place . <sssss> well , i stopped in and was so excited to learn that it was a coffee/wine bar . <sssss> i have been back several times for lunch and dinner and it just keeps getting better and better . <sssss> i even hosted my monthly book club here and everyone had a spectacular time . <sssss> the staff is great and rebecca , josh and jeff always aim to please . <sssss> i highly recommend the lavosh of the moment & the roast beef sliders are divine ! <sssss> follow them on twitter as they tweet specials almost every day . <sssss> ca n't wait to see more people discover this little gem . 
5		very good pizza , really great service . <sssss> true it is in a dodgy area . <sssss> but , all big city 's are like that . <sssss> the place is small inside . <sssss> but , you can always take it to go if you do n't like that . <sssss> it smells wonderful when you come in . <sssss> great food cooking ! <sssss> there is enough parking for what you need to do . <sssss> we think the food is great here and we love it ! 
5		i think roka akor is amazing and i tell everyone i can think of about it . <sssss> maybe , it 's because i had my first date with my love here , but no , it 's because of the pork belly . <sssss> or wait , the butterfish crudo ? <sssss> could it be the black cod ? <sssss> the brussels sprouts ? <sssss> the simple grilled asparagus that is so delicious ? <sssss> i think it 's the combination of extremely high quality food and some cool bartenders who make really good shochu infusions and are friendly enough to tell you about the process and give you their suggestions . <sssss> i suggest the cosmo made with an infused shochu -lrb- pear if they have it or cranberry is good too ! -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> this is n't for people who think that a high priced dish should equal a mountain of food , but if truly respect and value quality food , you will like this place a lot . <sssss> i will say the pork belly is the absolute best i have ever had . <sssss> the happy hour is really good too , and those little burgers are freakin delicious ! <sssss> ask for the baby burgers during happy hour , they are sooooo good ! <sssss> if they allow you to order the beets as a side dish do it ! <sssss> normally they are a garnish for a dish , but solo , the heirloom beets with chives are truly my favorite side dish of all time . <sssss> i like that roka offers you something whether you want to splurge and indulge or if you just want something inexpensive for happy hour and a drink on your way home . <sssss> they do n't try to be one way or the other and maybe more people need to know that they do offer something for everyone -lrb- everyone who appreciates good food , that is ! -rrb- 
5		postinos little sister ! <sssss> went here for lunch very good ! <sssss> the staff was friendly and the prices were good ! 
5		best alcoholic/cigar store out their , wish they had one in san angelo . <sssss> i 've bought plenty of drinks from here for the best prices . 
5		this is my new favorite restaurant for comfort food . <sssss> the buttermilk fried chicken is dee-lish . <sssss> it 's only $ 9.99 for eat all you can on wednesday nights . <sssss> i signed up for emails and now i see there are specials almost each night . <sssss> i 'm definitely going back and taking the family with me . <sssss> my co-worker says the breakfasts are great so we are planning to eat there this weekend . <sssss> how nice to have a great neighborhood restaurant we can just walk to ! 
5		nothing better in az. . <sssss> this is where i would go for my last meal . 
5		love this place ! <sssss> food delicious ! 
5		this is a fantastic radio station . <sssss> wake up and listen to news on npr ; fall asleep after a long day at work listening to great jazz . <sssss> plus , the selection of jazz the station plays is fantastic , including a nice variety of jazz vocals , which i 've never really heard much on other jazz stations . <sssss> i 'm not big on modern , free jazz -lrb- a la john coltrane -rrb- , but i have n't heard much of that on this station , so i 'm happy -- this is definitely a 5 star radio station . 
5		snap , so you want to be an organic grower . <sssss> i 'm a private gardner . <sssss> i specialize in peppers , tomatoes , beans , onions , mint . <sssss> a variety of herbs . <sssss> i call this a healing garden . <sssss> i cultivate . <sssss> being able to resurrect heirloom vegetables is not only trending but it 's being part of the greater interest in growing and eating locally grown foods that are revolutionizing our culinary scene . <sssss> many local restaurants are buying farmers market produce . <sssss> the real secret to growing is water and living earth . <sssss> this should not be confused with hose water and dirt . <sssss> learning about modern growing techniques such as brewing tea , alaskan compost , guano , microorganisms in the living soil and amendments will give you bigger and healthier yields . <sssss> stop in for a class with brian or nick . 
5		all i had was the salted caramel pudding ... dddddaaaammmmmmmmnnnn ! <sssss> it was gooood . <sssss> tastes just like those little caramel blocks i used to eat as a kid -lrb- and admitting with guilt , even now too -rrb- . <sssss> def try this dessert ! <sssss> staff was friendly and nice too . <sssss> very quick service ! 
5		i was so pleasantly surprised with the breakfast club . <sssss> i wanted to take my mom to a nice brunch on a monday ... and i thought the orange table . <sssss> we walked in there and they stopped breakfast at 11 , so i knew that i never went to the breakfast club before , but thought hey why not . <sssss> it was such a windy day when we went and the newspapers were flying everywhere on our table . <sssss> but we still enjoyed ourselves . <sssss> service was wonderful ; very attentive . <sssss> my mom loved her pancakes and i was so thrilled to find french toast made of challah ! <sssss> -lrb- there is no other way to make french toast -rrb- i also had hash browns -lrb- wanted the carbs i guess -rrb- and they were awesome as well . <sssss> the prices were a little bit high for breakfast food , but i have to remember that i am in old town scottsdale . <sssss> i would love to go back there anytime . <sssss> : -rrb- 
5		i 'm giving this five fat stars because i 'd get fat if i still lived in arizona and was subjected to the close proximity of this restaurant to my apartment . <sssss> and job . <sssss> i ca n't remember other things on the menu , other than the pad thai . <sssss> i 'm not sure if pad thai is thai -lrb- makes sense that it would be -rrb- , but i see it at non-fusion chinese restaurants , often . <sssss> anyway , i do n't care about authenticity when something is this spectacularly good . <sssss> i am very afraid of flying . <sssss> i had to fly back and forth from phoenix to burbank -lrb- los angeles area -rrb- once per month for work . <sssss> i needed comfort when i stepped off the plane , regardless of if it had only been a one hour and five minute flight . <sssss> i 'd make a beeline here after getting back to arizona . <sssss> yummy pad thai . <sssss> i miss you so much . <sssss> you were my friend and comfort against the horrors and fears of the scorpion enemies . <sssss> wide , flat -lrb- but short -rrb- noodles . <sssss> . <sssss> slightly curled . <sssss> . <sssss> chicken , egg , sprouts , and other good-tasting things . <sssss> i would usually get my order to-go , but the seating area seems cool , too . <sssss> service was also great . <sssss> . <sssss> to-go order always ready to go . <sssss> . <sssss> price was right . <sssss> you know that feeling you get in the deepest parts of your gums and jaw . <sssss> . <sssss> that tingling thing that begins the process of salivation ? <sssss> it 's happening now . <sssss> they 're heeeeeere ! 
5		i hate to one of `` those people '' who airs their dirty laundry in public but after using the dry cleaning services at tlc i feel i must get the word out ! <sssss> after moving i needed to find a new local dry cleaner , so i did some research and found tlc based on their good reviews and close location . <sssss> i then chose to take my beloved bedding there . <sssss> these are not your ordinary dirty sheets mind you , but my favorite , took forever to shop for , procured by careful planning of good sales , discounts and saved up gift cards vera wang bedding , shams and matching throw pillows included . <sssss> i could not trust them to just anyone ! <sssss> before the cooler weather , i wanted to make sure they were clean of the usual child cup spills , spoiled little dog who sneaks into my bed hair , late night filibertos spills and well lets just say mystery stains . <sssss> i took them to tlc which was the cleanest laundry mat / dry cleaning business i 've seen . <sssss> the lady at the front counter was friendly and took the time to tell me they 'd been very busy and it would take several days to be ready . <sssss> well winter was n't anytime soon so i took my chances . <sssss> she took down my info and gave me my pick up slip , and let me know they 'd call when ready . <sssss> two days sooner than i expected i received a call that my precious was clean . <sssss> i was n't able to get them right away but when i did the friendly gentleman at the front counter found them in seconds . <sssss> i was amazing at how inexpensive my bill was , especially for a queen comforter , shame & decorative pillow covers . <sssss> they looked practically perfect , almost like brand new again . <sssss> no more dog hair , drink , food or mystery stains ! <sssss> i 've found a new dry cleaner , the name says it all ! <sssss> thanks tlc for taking great care of my dirty laundry !!! 
5		i do n't even know what to say . <sssss> like a sweet breath of air in the middle of a phoenix summer , a joyous explosion of beauty . <sssss> just go to angel sweet . <sssss> get the plum , get the dark chocolate , get the mango , get the banana , get the panna cotta ... it 's all heavenly . 
5		we would like to personally thank rebecca the manager for the wonderful service she provided to my brother and his friends for prom . <sssss> i was given bad information for my brother and his friends for prom night but rebecca worked everything out and was so wonderful to have a table waiting and ready when they arrived . <sssss> thank you , thank you , thank you that was so awesome that you were able to do that . 
5		the best place for a late night snack or a mid day munch . <sssss> all different pastys for your all the different taste buds out there . <sssss> delicious unique desserts , great people and atmosphere . <sssss> you ca n't go wrong with the great beer and drink selection either . <sssss> definitely a regular spot for me , my friends , and fam . 
5		found this place on yelp because i was in the mood for some old school teriyaki chicken . <sssss> was a big fan of tokyo express and blue fin . <sssss> this place did n't disappoint . <sssss> the teriyaki chicken rocked ! 
5		the food was great and the service was better . <sssss> it 's cheaper which is perfect for a casual date night or dinner with friends . <sssss> the meals are easily shared and the pizza is definitely made to order . <sssss> our server melissa was so great i asked to speak with her manager . <sssss> she was patient , quick , easy going and nice . <sssss> i will definitely go again . 
5		whoa ! <sssss> i felt so taken care of at this home depot !! <sssss> :-rrb- the boy asked me to stop and pick up 2 gallons of paint on my way home because he 'd run out . <sssss> as soon as i got to the paint aisle and had a gallon in each hand , he called and asked that i actually buy 5 gallons of paint - better to have too much than run out again . <sssss> :-rrb- not even thinking about it , i put my 2 gallons back , grabbed the handle of a 5 gallon bucket of paint , and started walking down the aisle to get it tinted . <sssss> i did n't get very far before i realized how heavy the stupid thing was and wondered how i would make it all the way to the car , let alone get it more than 3 inches off the ground and in to the car . <sssss> just then , friendly guy # 1 from the paint section came down the aisle and asked if i needed help . <sssss> yes please ! <sssss> he carried the bucket to the tinting area and i went off in search of a cart . <sssss> once my paint was ready , friendly guy # 1 loaded it onto my cart , told me to have a nice day , and off i went to check out . <sssss> as i pushed my cart to the check out , i slowed by the self-checkout lanes - wondering if i could scan the bucket without having to lift it . <sssss> friendly guy # 2 running the self-checkout area spotted me and said , `` let me help you ! '' <sssss> he motioned to one of the registers and then scanned it with his scanner . <sssss> voila ! <sssss> then friendly guy # 2 told me to have a nice day , and i was off ! <sssss> i was pretty stoked at this point because now all i had to do was get it in the car ! <sssss> :-rrb- enter friendly guy # 3 . <sssss> the second i walked out the door , before i even got my sunglasses on , friendly guy # 3 spots me and offers to help load the paint into my car . <sssss> he helped pull the cart to my car and loaded it up for me . <sssss> then he told me to have a nice day and off he went -lrb- returning my empty cart for me -rrb- . <sssss> thanks to the boy , i frequent a lot of different home depots and lowe 's locations . <sssss> i 'm usually not impressed with their customer service because , let 's face it - they 're guys helping guys ... conversations are stereotypically short and to the point with very few niceties . <sssss> the 3 -lrb- count them - 3 -rrb- guys that helped me today were nothing but genuinely friendly . <sssss> i would gladly go back without the boy in tow and feel comfortable knowing at least some of their guys are the good ones there and actually want to help me . <sssss> :-rrb- -lrb- wish i 'd caught their names ... i think i was just too busy counting my lucky stars that i did n't have to lift that stupid bucket ... -rrb- 
5		chinese food and beer served until 2am ... how nice . <sssss> big bar , big patio , great staff and even a few customers were helpful as what too order . <sssss> they suggested black pepper chicken with kung pao sauce over chow mein noodles . <sssss> it was a great choice as this dish was n't too spicy and the crispy noodles made a great alternative to boring old rice . <sssss> egg rolls were not great though , but had to try them out right . <sssss> they have plenty of craft beers on tap , but no real master list of everything . <sssss> otherwise , it 's a great concept and good food to boot . 
5		wonderful ! <sssss> great food , drinks and atmosphere . 
5		the best popcorn ever ... try the jalapeño flavor -- it 's excellent ! <sssss> the owners are very friendly and welcoming . <sssss> i 'll definitely recommend this place to everyone ! 
5		i 'm really not a donut fan but this place makes me my husband ca n't resist going here every weekend to get donuts they are the best . <sssss> forget ddonuts ... their donuts at bosa are so fresh and yummy . <sssss> the donuts do not lack flavor at all the cake one 's especially when they have just been made melt in your mouth . <sssss> a must try at this location not a fan of the phx location on indian school 
5		loved the breakfast croissants here . <sssss> friendly and fast service , and a small business feel . <sssss> the iced drinks are also a plus ! 
5		great vegan options ! <sssss> the food is always fresh and prepared well . <sssss> it can be a little crowded but the atmosphere is fun . <sssss> one of my favorite places ! 
5		recently had wonderful , fresh , and lively food for lunch on a sat . <sssss> my husband had a beef salad -lrb- made his eyes roll with delight -rrb- , and i had excellent chicken pho with the typical additions on the side . <sssss> delicious spring rolls . <sssss> friendly , helpful wait staff . <sssss> clean , pleasant decor . <sssss> a very economical and rewarding experience . <sssss> we 'll be back ! <sssss> thank you , viet kitchen . 
5		i love this place ! <sssss> they usually serve some sort of free bread and spread before your meal for free ! <sssss> great thing for a small family place . <sssss> :-rrb- this restaurant is totally one of the most hidden treasures of phoenix . <sssss> i mean it 's right next door to a circle k ! <sssss> but the food is great , and they 've created a very warm atmosphere inside . <sssss> i have tried a few of the house made pasta 's , and while they 're good i say go for the pizza . <sssss> their pizza has some of the freshest tomato sauce around , and the cheese is to die for . <sssss> actually that 's all i need on a pizza , no more toppings please . <sssss> i love the margarita pizza . <sssss> i came here for my birthday and got some free tiramisu , awesome ! <sssss> check it out if you love rustic pizza . 
5		i love this place . <sssss> the prices are unbeatable . <sssss> the people that work there are terrifc , friendly , and helpful . <sssss> it is just 1 mile from our home , so i do not over buy , or i end up throwing stuff away . <sssss> even if you do not live close to them , it is well worth the trip to find out what they are all about !

5		we went there right before my grandma 's 100th birthday . <sssss> there were about 20 of us . <sssss> the place was busy but we called ahead and they put our name in even though we still did n't have a final count of people . <sssss> the place was busy but i know why . <sssss> everyone had a different dish and we all loved it . <sssss> everyone wanted to taste each others food because we all liked it so much . <sssss> we all seem to think we are food critics and we loved this place . <sssss> extensive menu and they seemed to nail everything we had ! <sssss> the staff was amazing and would go back in a heartbeat ! 
5		great local dog park with tons of room for the dogs to run ! 
5		awesome pizza ! <sssss> music was so cool too ! <sssss> great for all ages ! <sssss> he accepts requests to plus birthday announcements ! <sssss> accepts only $ or checks ! 
5		this is the wedding of a smart owner and some great cooks in the kitchen . <sssss> first off , they have a small -- probably 8 tables at most and that 's counting several 2 person tiny tables -- cafe offstreet in an alley . <sssss> we had a little problem finding it with the gps but we did . <sssss> he does have tons of parking , tho , across the street so that 's no problem for those of you who worry . <sssss> when we went last night in mid-january he had plenty of tables outside with many people sitting out there and even his hostess podium there , too . <sssss> very smart move . <sssss> nobody seemed to mind it was winter and sitting outside , so i can only guess it was suitably warm out there . <sssss> we , however , were sat inside right next to the kitchen . <sssss> but , then again , if you are inside the cafe you will always be somewhat close to the kitchen . <sssss> now , the service : either this owner has told his servers to realllly take care of the patrons or we got the world 's greatest server . <sssss> this gal -lrb- i 'm guess 40 's , long blonde hair -rrb- first gave us when we said we 'd order sangria 2 tastes of both white and red for us to decide which one . <sssss> we went with the white that night . <sssss> it was good , but , having lived in spain , it was n't really authentic sangria . <sssss> where was the fruit that always goes in sangria a la spain ? <sssss> oh well ... still good tasting . <sssss> the lady server also gave us 2 free empanadas for me and my gal pal to taste . <sssss> omg ! <sssss> i have never ever liked empanadas because the crust is always crap and the filling is always dry or dull . <sssss> but these empanadas ... like nothing i have ever tried before : judgment is fantastically delicious ! <sssss> we both ordered the pork dinner which is pork shoulder -lrb- pulled pork to you -rrb- sans any sauce which comes on the side . <sssss> it 's a whitish sauce -- i think they called it mole or moro or something -- that was light and delicious to me . <sssss> i poured it all over my huge portion of pork . <sssss> i also ordered the special potatoes -lrb- wonderful ! -rrb- <sssss> and the creamed corn -lrb- a tad jalapeno hot for me but not bad at all -rrb- . <sssss> my friend ordered the jalapeno bread , and i will get that next time as she gave me a taste ... and , again , delicious . <sssss> i consider myself somewhat of a foodie , and i say this place is soooo worth going to again and again . <sssss> great food ! <sssss> and even my gal pal who has some kind of intestinal bowel problem said she wanted to go back she loved it so much . <sssss> this is my go-to place to eat in phoenix now when i want some spanish-style foods . <sssss> fresh , delicious and you really get taken care of here . <sssss> i love this place , and i can tell by this young owner 's attitude that he really wants you to love his food and his service ... and to enjoy yourself . <sssss> we did , we do and we will definitely be back here !!!! <sssss> my prediction from the smart way the owner has set his place up that he will go very , very far in the restaurant business . <sssss> clever set-up , great food , great service = a whopping success !!!! <sssss> -lrb- oh , forgot : the lady server -- since we went between getting the short rib or the pork -- also brought us a couple bites of the short rib to taste . <sssss> is that fantastic service or what ???? -rrb- <sssss> update : been there a couple times now and ordered the same thing as before -- only they did n't give up any free empanadas that night . <sssss> dang ... we were so stuffed anyway we could hardly get up from the table . <sssss> food still delicious , tho ! <sssss> i love this restaurant , and plan to bring my ex-chef son here to eat soon . 
5		i love this place ! <sssss> get the jade red chicken quesadilla and you will not regret it . <sssss> i go to school in california now and all my friends here know about it . <sssss> when they come and visit me in arizona , chino 's is always our first stop . <sssss> i could not recommend this place enough ! <sssss> not only is the food delicious -lrb- i usually get a jade red chicken quesadilla , emerald chicken , jerk fried rice , and refried beans -rrb- but you get a cookie with it ! <sssss> it 's the best . <sssss> go in with an empty stomach and get ready to be blown away ! 
5		my family has been using dr. burke for our pets since i was to young to remember . <sssss> he has a great personality , is very knowledgeable and is great with the pets ! <sssss> his prices are fair and you can usually get an appointment within a week or sooner for emergencies . <sssss> the offices are always clean , bright and the front desk staff is very friendly . <sssss> we have brought dogs , cats and birds to dr. burke . 
5		5 stars -- 10 if they were available ! <sssss> have been frequenting this joint for 7 years now . <sssss> not a bad choice on the menu but the pad thai -lrb- seasoned to your palate -rrb- , the orange chicken , panang and walnut shrimp are particular favorites -- they set the standard for the entire valley , if not the galaxy ! <sssss> try it , you 'll not be disappointed -- i 'll guarantee it ! <sssss> yummy stuff ! <sssss> ps -- tott 's is no longer at the guadalupe location . <sssss> they 've moved to ray road and mcclintock . 
5		best tortilla factory in the valley , bar none . <sssss> they seemingly make them after you order 'em so they are fresh as all get out . <sssss> even with the place being dirty and a bit gross on the inside , it still gets a 5 star . 
5		wow , never have i though that pub food could be this delicious . <sssss> cornish pasty co. is by definition a hole in the wall well worth driving too from any where in the valley if you are seeking simple , affordable and downright deliciously satisfying food . <sssss> the menu is impressively varied , from typical , premium to signature pasties . <sssss> i went with the lamb vindaloo and its spiciness left me goofy with delight . <sssss> there is no host/hostess at the entrance , so you can either seat yourself at the bar , and you can even hang your purse from underneath the counter ! <sssss> the service is warm , friendly and efficient . <sssss> dinner for two without drinks was a bargain at $ 25 . 
5		yes ! <sssss> yes ! <sssss> yes ! <sssss> i am so happy to have gone back to the shroom the other day . <sssss> i was hesitant . <sssss> my first review of the shroom here in az back in june 2012 was pretty bad . <sssss> 2 stars . <sssss> it pained me to leave one of my all-time favorite atlanta originals a 2 star scathing review . <sssss> the shroom here in az has it dialed in . <sssss> it is as good as i remember from growing up in atlanta . <sssss> the yummy whole wheat crust is awesome . <sssss> baked on the stone . <sssss> my mouth is watering just typing up this review . <sssss> i have to admit that i love having a server that is passionate about something and it shows . <sssss> our server assisted me in selecting the perfect beer for me . <sssss> having 50 beers on tap to choose from makes selecting the perfect beer hit or miss without a aficionado . <sssss> as my man schwarzenegger says , `` i 'll be back ! '' 
5		i had a wonderful experience here . <sssss> they have a table in the waiting room for filling out paperwork . <sssss> that was awesome . <sssss> -lrb- i 'm easy to please , apparently -rrb- . <sssss> the doctors and nurses were great , and sent me home with a free cd of my x-ray , rather than having to email it or charge me for it , which saved me $ 200 at the hand specialist . <sssss> thanks everyone ! <sssss> : -rrb- 
5		great theatre ! <sssss> super clean and nice sound in all theatres . <sssss> only caveat : i can read the prices on the beverage and popcorn menu sign thing , so when i order a medium , i want a medium , i can see that for 50 cents more i can get the large . <sssss> i just do n't want to pee myself when i get caught up in a good flick . <sssss> but thanks anyway . 
5		this is such a great thing to have in surprise . <sssss> my wife and i had never really played any racquet sports before moving to surprise . <sssss> we immediately picked up racquetball as it 's really one of the only good sports to do in the summer due to the heat . <sssss> we are just starting to pick up tennis , but i can say with certainty that there is no way we would have gotten as involved if this place was n't so close to our home . <sssss> i 'd give it 6 stars if i could . 
5		great mediterranean food in arizona . <sssss> generally go once a week for a broiled chicken pita and baba ganoush . <sssss> both are very delicious and the price is very reasonable . <sssss> service is laid back and casual and food comes fast . <sssss> all in all a great place for friends or a date . 
5		absolutely delicious !!! <sssss> read the reviews and knew i had to make a visit . <sssss> the place was small , had plenty of parking , and had a few jewelry vendors outside . <sssss> service was friendly and pretty quick with our orders . <sssss> the ultimate taco with green chili sauce was sooo good . <sssss> the bread was tasty - fried perfectly and was such a large portion . <sssss> try the ground beef taco as well , if you 're not into saucy . <sssss> the hominy stew was good - simple but flavorful . <sssss> sodas come with free refills . <sssss> -lrb- wish i noticed the sign before ordering a ` large ' -rrb- their large is huge and comparable to a 2 person family sized portion ? <sssss> lol i do n't know how to describe it but large was definitely an understatement . <sssss> the food here definitely hit the spot and the next time i 'm in phoenix , i will have to stop by ! 
5		fantastic coffee . <sssss> tfg , i was beginning to worry that there was absolutely no coffee culture here in the valley . 
5		if you are looking for ultimate skin care and waxing this is the place ! <sssss> i received the best microderm ever ! <sssss> since then i have been getting my waxing and facial treatments done with cindy . <sssss> she also offers a great mineral makeup line jane iredell . <sssss> i highly recommend cindy ! 
5		had one of their sonoran hot dogs last weekend . <sssss> omg ! <sssss> it was fantastic ! <sssss> the ingredients do n't seem like they should go well together , but was awesome ! <sssss> good thing this place is n't closer to my house . 
5		you know that scene in duplicity where michael keaton is explaining that a copy of a copy is just a little off ? <sssss> well it 's true . <sssss> i needed to make a copy of my key , but i only had a copy of a copy of a copy . <sssss> not knowing of any locksmiths in my area i came across pop-a-lock on yelp . <sssss> bill , the owner , answered my call and came out within the hour to rekey my house . <sssss> he did a great job and did n't leave a mess . <sssss> i give pop-a-lock an a + + + . 
5		this place has amazing bagels . <sssss> i feel like im back east . <sssss> they have half priced bagels i believe after 2pm and close at 2:30 pm im not positive about those times . <sssss> but go here you wont be disappointed and if you are you dont know good bagels . 
5		the sandwiches on a pretzel roll were delicious !!! <sssss> the cocktails were refreshing on the warm phoenix day . <sssss> plus , they were showing a soccer match , ca n't get much better than that . 
5		you ca n't beat the after school $ 1 kids cones mon - thu , the always happy service and classically good , not overpriced ice cream 
5		i went to the melting pot with my mother , 7 year old daughter and boyfriend for my 37th birthday and it was awesome ! <sssss> this is such a fantastic place to have a nice dinner with people you care about . <sssss> the food is amazing and the service is great . <sssss> it took 3 hours for us to complete our 4 course meal . <sssss> we chose to do the all you can eat style 4 course meal which includes a salad . <sssss> we were stuffed !! <sssss> i 'd recommend this to anyone looking to have a great meal and spend time with people you care about and enjoy . 
5		update for an update - they have totally remodeled ! <sssss> yaiii . <sssss> leather sofas - yup ! <sssss> added tables - check larger space - check new 2nd bar - niiiiice ! <sssss> bistro highboy seating - check shiny , big screen tv 's - check special orders ? <sssss> check , check amazing wine tastings - check new , classy wood floors - check top-notch winemakers visiting - check best prices in all of az ? <sssss> check-a-roo ! <sssss> food & wine now being served - yesssssss trying to locate that htf bottle ? <sssss> they gotcha covered ! <sssss> completely knowledgeable & educated staff ? <sssss> just ask tom or andrea 
5		i meet my in-laws in wickenburg when my 2rd old princess goes to visit them in kingman . <sssss> we 've met for breakfast at the horseshoe cafe -lrb- check out my review -rrb- , but this time we decided to do lunch . <sssss> i had read the past reviews for el ranchero , so we decided to try it out . <sssss> delish ! <sssss> simple mexican home-cooking is the best way to describe this place . <sssss> all the ingredients were fresh and cooked perfectly . <sssss> my husband had their taco salad with chicken . <sssss> what they brought out was not what we were expecting . <sssss> it was a taco shell in the shape of a pie crust -lrb- genius ! -rrb- <sssss> , homemade guacamole , sour cream , the usual salad stuff , and chunks , i mean chunks , of tender , juicy chicken breast . <sssss> the chicken was falling apart and it just melted in your mouth . <sssss> yum ! <sssss> i had their veggie burrito . <sssss> all fresh ingredients and just enough to fill you for the 1 hour drive back to mesa . <sssss> my 2yr old had their chicken nuggets with beans . <sssss> she loves it . <sssss> their beans are great , especially with tortilla chips , her fave . <sssss> their salsa is also fresh and good . <sssss> we 've now made this place our wickenburg child-exchange location . <sssss> haha . <sssss> ca n't wait to go back . 
5		love this place . <sssss> what i love most is how versatile it is . <sssss> it 's one of my favorite places for lunch because its so close to the office . <sssss> great lunch pricing because the half salads are enough to fill me up and there just $ 7 . <sssss> ca n't beat that ! <sssss> then after work the lounge-feel really pops and the drink menu is super fun . <sssss> one thing to warn , it 's a `` open '' establishment with a colorful splash ! <sssss> i totally enjoy it , but if you an in the box type of person , you may not so much ! 
5		cartel has ruined me for all other coffee , this is best coffee i 've ever had . <sssss> sometimes it can take a while waiting in line , but its always worth it and the staff is always very friendly . 
5		thank you sumits yoga ! <sssss> first of all thank you for your lovely staff . <sssss> they all make you feel welcome . <sssss> love erin ! <sssss> i was somewhat apprehensive with the whole hot yoga thing ; fear of reinjuring my hamstrings , fear of passing out and creating mayhem when everyone is practicing being calm . <sssss> erin 's personality allowed me to be brave . <sssss> as it turns out even at my age i can actually do this ! <sssss> are you listening ? <sssss> this is my message : this whole hot yoga experience was in and of itself an experiment to see if it would assist in clearing my psorasis that i have had for over 10 years . <sssss> yep , i took pictures to track my progress . <sssss> i changed my diet , added super foods & super herbs , only use organic products , -lrb- love the seaweed bath co products -rrb- but the biggest change was trying to do hot yoga 5 days a week . <sssss> it 's going on 2 months and i do not always make 5 days a week more like 3 days a week . <sssss> so far my skin has improved 75 % . <sssss> if you know anything about psorasis this is significant . <sssss> i have also met some really lovely people . <sssss> love the staff ; keep up the great work and thank you from the bottom of my heart . <sssss> m. lynch 
5		fantastic facility , i only had an hour here and i must return for a more in depth trip . <sssss> the architecture and layout are beautiful . <sssss> as a lifelong musician , it was difficult to not touch everything ! <sssss> a very comprehensive collection of instruments . <sssss> the hand held `` story '' unit with headphones synced up with various looped videos of musical performances recorded from around the world . 
5		vito 's is the decendent of white cottage pizza in wood dale il , a suburb of chicago . <sssss> vito and his wife retired a few years ago and transitioned the pizzeria to other family members from chicagoland . <sssss> the deep dish is authentic and wonderful . <sssss> it is tasty , the crust is flaky and the toppings are high quality . <sssss> this is the go-to place for chicago style deep dish pizza . <sssss> call ahead and avoid the 45 minute wait for one of these bad boys . <sssss> while the strip shopping center is a strip shopping center , i have never had a bad experience and have found that parking is usually available right in front of the restaurant . <sssss> there is a liquor store in the shopping center where one can purchase adult beverages to be enjoyed in the pizzeria . <sssss> abondanza ! 
5		i love this nail salon !! <sssss> i had gone in with my daughter as walk ins and we were made to feel very comfortable . <sssss> it was our first visit as i had received a coupon in the mail and decided to try it out . <sssss> i had a manicure and she got gel nails . <sssss> we were pleased with our results but unfortunately her nails only lasted one week as she is a waitress and was not used to them . <sssss> we came back and she got her nails redone -lrb- at a discount since they realized it had only been one week -rrb- and i got a pedicure from theresa . <sssss> omg !! <sssss> it had been about 3 years since i had my last pedicure as i got a nasty infection from my last experience and was afraid to go to any nail salons . <sssss> i had callouses galore and needed a lot of work but that did n't stop theresa at all !! <sssss> i have to admit , i was very reluctant and embarrassed to have anyone look at my feet ever !!! <sssss> theresa was awesome and made me feel completely comfortable . <sssss> i am now planning on a regular schedule of pedicures with theresa to keep my feet looking amazing through the summer and beyond . <sssss> if you have issues with past pedicures or have worn , calloused feet try out pronails and they will make you look and feel great . <sssss> the only thing i wished is that we should have taken before and after pictures !! <sssss> theresa is amazing !!!!!!!! <sssss> so is pro nails !!!! 
5		simply the best there is . <sssss> from their hummus -lrb- the jalapeno-cilantro one is my fav -rrb- , to the chicken pasta -lrb- my wife 's fav -rrb- to the falafel or gyro 's ... you ca n't go wrong . <sssss> great service , chill atmosphere , decent prices and ... the food ... amazing . <sssss> i do n't know why i do n't go here more often . <sssss> and i 've frequented alot of them -lrb- the one on apache , ray rd in chandler & ahwatukee -rrb- ... they are often busy , especially weekends , but its well worth it . <sssss> i like the diverse crowd too ... its not like its just a haven for yogi 's & hippies , which is nice . <sssss> nothing worse than feeling out of place , and this place , doesnt do that at all . 
5		unsurpassed !!!! <sssss> our dinner in the new `` praying monk '' dining area of elements was fantastic ... the view ... spectacular !! <sssss> the new dining area is awesome ... more intimate and less `` active '' then then the main dining room , with warm wood tones and floor to ceiling sliding glass doors that permit uninterrupted views of paradise valley ! <sssss> we noticed 2 outdoor seating areas , which , in cooler weather ... would be prime seating !!! <sssss> we started with * ahi tuna tartar and the elemental soup ... both were amazing ... the tuna , perfectly balanced on a bed of seasoned cucumber `` pasta '' coupled with 3 sesame pancakes ... the squash soup was velvety with a `` tempura '' squash blossom floating as a center piece ... a perfect beginning ... our salads were perfect ; the caesar was lightly dressed and far from the gloppy mess that many establishments offer ... the tomato & watermelon mosaic salad was amazing ... perfectly ripened heirloom tomatoes , fresh `` shaved '' watermelon and a flavorful charred pepper sorbet . <sssss> . <sssss> the light herbed dressing that was `` whispered '' on the plate enhanced the entire dish ... my guest enjoyed the nights special , grilled lamb ... which , i did n't get a chance to review . <sssss> it apparently was so good ... he did n't want to share . <sssss> i enjoyed a perfectly cooked pan roasted free range chicken `` kung pao '' style . <sssss> i was pleased that the kung pao seasoning was engaged with the pearl pasta so i was able enjoy the chick two ways ... natural & succulent ... however i could also enlist the pasta to add the kung pao flavor . <sssss> the additional sides ordered were the truffled mac n ' cheese . <sssss> . <sssss> much lighter then expected , and the tender , tender , tender grilled asparagus ... yum !!! <sssss> deserts enjoyed were the german chocolate cake & coconut gelato along with the strawberry rhubarb funnel cake & buttermilk ice cream . <sssss> both were decedent ... but the coconut gelato was soooooooo good , we had to order another scoop . <sssss> i used to enjoy eating at the tables `` nudged '' up against the large windows facing the pool in the main dining room ... but now that i 've experienced the praying monk room ... there will be no going back ... the new dining area really is special !!! 
5		if you love great pizza and you believe good dough and sauce are the foundation to great pizza . <sssss> . <sssss> then look no further ! <sssss> i have been hunting for a pizza joint since i moved here three years ago . <sssss> . <sssss> many have fallen so short and left me bitter , until i found nypd . <sssss> they use fresh ingredients and it shows in the flavor of the pizza . <sssss> i like the thin crust , and i love the variety of table spices that you can add to your pizza . <sssss> . <sssss> be warned the pizzas do take time to cook , so if your a bit hungry order an appetizer along with your order . <sssss> this pizza is worth the wait and is phenomenal , i love the crust and order a 16 or a 14 inch pie which is plenty for the next day . 
5		delicious swordfish tacos and magical patio area . <sssss> love riding bikes here and especially love the complimentary chocolate chip and sea salt cookies ! <sssss> another arcadia gem . 
5		one of my new favorite places in old town . <sssss> we went here because we had a restraints.com gift certificate . <sssss> we went for happy hour . <sssss> the prices were reasonable and the food was excellent . <sssss> my friend and i split the crab bruschetta , veggi sandwich and a chocolate mouse cake . <sssss> they were each above expectations . <sssss> the staff was friendly and attentive . <sssss> the decor was very nice . <sssss> a + evo !!! 
5		this place is seriously amazing . <sssss> i 'm so glad it opened up so close to asu campus ! <sssss> everything is good . <sssss> my favorites are the raspberry chipotle chicken tacos , sweet pork tacos/salad , or the mango chicken salad . <sssss> although i do love a good taco -lrb- and this place certainly has it ! -rrb- <sssss> , i was surprised by just how much food is in the salad . <sssss> if you 're really hungry , get it ! <sssss> have n't tried the other menu options yet ... i want to try a burrito next . <sssss> anyways , i 'm not sure you can go wrong with this place . <sssss> the main reason this place gets five stars , though , is the customer service . <sssss> i 've seen some mixed reviews about their customer service here , but honestly , i 'm not sure if they 're true . <sssss> i was stuck in the restaurant during an intense thunderstorm one night , and i was freaking out because i not only had to ride my bike to my class , but i had my computer and was afraid that it would get soaked in the rain . <sssss> the manager came out and personally seran-wrapped my entire computer and phone , and then gave me some plastic bags to put my purse and computer in to ensure they would be protected from the rain . <sssss> needless to say , costa vida has a customer for life . <sssss> not every restaurant would do something like that . 
5		absolutely the best east coast style sandwiches in town . <sssss> the italian beef is unbelievable and i 've had a lot of good pastrami but here it melts in your mouth . <sssss> this family owned and run business has been in the same spot for 35 years . <sssss> joe , the owner is a vet and a true american hero . <sssss> if he has time , he likes to sit and tell stories to his customers ... ask him about where he got the recipe for his italian beef . 
5		i was on yelp looking for some good places to eat , someplace with good reviews . <sssss> and i ran across this place . <sssss> now , it was quite a ways to drive , but i figured , what the heck . <sssss> it was , without a doubt , the best chinese buffet i have ever been to . <sssss> the food is fresh and cooked just right . <sssss> the sushi bar is really good and fresh . <sssss> the fresh fruit is pentiful and fresh . <sssss> even the baked steamed fish is good . <sssss> i am a big crab puff person , and the amount of filling in these was amazing . <sssss> i will go back to this place over and over again . <sssss> anyone reading this , it 's worth the drive ! 
5		i only have a few things to say : 1 . <sssss> the fries are probably the most amazing tasting fries i 've had in the state of arizona . <sssss> 2 . <sssss> the custard/sundaes are the bomb . <sssss> that 's it . 
5		i referred myself to endo associates , specifically , dr harari , based on their reviews on a site specifically for rating health care providers . <sssss> and i 'm damn glad i did . <sssss> dr harari is fantastic . <sssss> on my first visit , he contradicted everything my previous endo said and did a much more thorough exam , which confirmed that my thyroid needed to come out immediately -lrb- multinodular goiter , 0.00 tsh -rrb- . <sssss> his manner is attentive and compassionate ; he did n't blow off my symptoms , and he treats his assistants with respect . <sssss> the ultrasound tech confided in me that everybody , patients and staff , loves him . <sssss> it 's easy to see why - he knows what he 's doing and is very easy to deal with . <sssss> thanks to him , i got fast-tracked to have my cancerous thyroid removed , where my previous endo told me it was nothing to worry about -lrb- 14cm across and 77g , nope , that 's just fine ! -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> following the surgery , he listened to my remaining concerns and laid out an action plan on the spot . <sssss> the rest of the practice is , afaict , just as competent . <sssss> i have no problems scheduling appointments or getting immediate callbacks , and everybody i 've talked to at the chandler and scottsdale offices is top-notch . <sssss> i absolutely and unreservedly recommend endocrinology associates , full stop . 
5		one pof my favorite take out mexican food places . <sssss> their sweet pork salad is zoo good ! <sssss> this place is usually a busy place and lines can be long , but they get the food to you fast . 
5		great spot , great coffee , great service and excellent for trying to get some work done 
5		the best street side tacos in phoenix ! <sssss> i 've been searching for real tacos in phoenix for years and this place has them . <sssss> cabeza , lengua , carne , pastor and there served up with grilled jalepenos and onions . <sssss> everything is great their tortas , beans , rice , ceviche . <sssss> the flavors are spot on . 
5		well i made my trip to this new dunkin donuts today and it was very impressive . <sssss> it used to be a art/frame store but was nicely converted into a new dunkin drive-thru location . <sssss> the store was crowded but the line moved super fast and we were in and out in about 5 minutes . <sssss> the iced coffee was made to perfection and the veggie eggwhite flatbread was just as good . <sssss> my girlfriend had her iced lattee and tried one of the new bacon and egg wraps for .99 cents . <sssss> it was pretty damn good i must say . <sssss> enough for her to eat but i would need two to fill me up a little . <sssss> met jason , the owner , and he was super nice and inviting . <sssss> he even gave us a free coffee card for our next visit ! <sssss> it was much appreciated and we will be back ! <sssss> he said he had been working hard to get this store open and it showed as he looked a little gaunt ... i told him to eat a few glazed to put some meat on his bones !! <sssss> : -rrb- 
5		i have had sushi in three different countries non of which are japan . <sssss> i love sushi and have long sought a rival to my favorite sushi restaurant islands sushi and pupu bar inside the crown plaza san diego . <sssss> i am still searching ; however kanpai has come the closest in arizona . <sssss> if you have the time get there ! <sssss> if you dont have the time stop what you are doing and get there ! <sssss> the fish is fresh and the rolls actually have flavor . <sssss> for the price the size of the rolls make ra look like preschool meals . <sssss> besides where else can you go in the valley and fit 30 of your closest friends inside your own private karaoke room ? <sssss> the way i see it is i have about 10 more rolls to explore then ill move on to the actual cooked menu . <sssss> im hungry now , whos up for sushi to my beloved ra i would like to say you meant nothing to me , i used you for a while and now it is time for me to move on . <sssss> i found the one i like more than you . <sssss> and yes you do look fat in those jeans . 
5		since the original poster is clearly unbiased and has no agenda , i will follow up with some more information . <sssss> yes , crisis pregnancy centers of arizona are focused on protecting the life of both the mother and the child . <sssss> this organization cares about the actual lives involved and provides women in crisis with comfort , information , and care in order to build a better future for everyone concerned . <sssss> you wo n't find the cynical abortion-pushers like planned parenthood at the crisis pregnancy centers . <sssss> instead of people who will hide information about your child 's development and pressure you to make a quick decision for an abortion , crisis pregnancy staff will provide you with as much information as possible for you to make a decision about the future of you and your child . <sssss> crisis pregnancy centers do , in fact , provide you with information about abortions ... except , unlike planned parenthood , they do n't have a financial interest in you having an abortion . 
5		5 * 's what more need i say . <sssss> all the food is wonderful . <sssss> great atmosphere and ambiance . <sssss> the almejas al vapor and the pumpkin bread pudding are amazing.oh . <sssss> . <sssss> and the guac is good , too . <sssss> -lrb- tableside -rrb- margaritas are n't too shabby either . <sssss> good place for a date . 
5		if you 're looking for `` clean '' & fresh food , you should check this place out . <sssss> this visit was my first time at true food kitchen . <sssss> tfk is on a whole different playing field when it comes to dining out . <sssss> i had the sesame noodle dish , do n't expect it to be like panda express ' chow mein . <sssss> the noodle dish was not greasy and i did n't feel guilty / heavy after eating it . <sssss> the bf ordered the turkey sandwich with 1/2 & 1/2 of the offered sides , sweet potato & kale salad . <sssss> i had a taste of each of the three items and they were all delicious . <sssss> next time , i 'm ordering something from the sandwich column . <sssss> we also got their flour-less chocolate cake togo & ate it for breakfast the next morning w/our coffee . <sssss> yum . <sssss> i wish they had more options for fresh squeezed juices , but you 'll see us back again at true food 's ! <sssss> hopefully they open one in san francisco-ca or better yet , san jose-ca . 
5		put the molcajete on your bucket list . <sssss> how i ever survived 62 years without ever hearing of let alone ingesting this fabulous dish is beyond comprehension . <sssss> as close as i can come to describing this dish is that it 's a tomato , seafood broth with loads of cheese -lrb- which surprisingly does not make for heaviness -rrb- that hides about a quarter pound of pd & c tail off shrimp . <sssss> great balance on the seasonings . <sssss> the establishment is clean and well lit . <sssss> the staff very friendly and willingly explained the dishes to their polish/gringo guest -lrb- moi -rrb- . <sssss> if you get the chance to meet lupita , the owner , do so ... a truly caring restaurateur and a lovely woman . <sssss> this is the type of place that ca n't be duplicated . 
5		i love this place ! <sssss> i work very close and needed new lunch options , so i was happy this restaurant came along . <sssss> i 'm a big salad person , so i like to mix it up once in a while and this is the perfect place to do so . <sssss> they have many veggie options along with picking your meat and dressing . <sssss> the workers are always nice , and i noticed they have many regulars that come in . <sssss> that 's always a good sign ! 
5		yay , finally remembered to come back ! <sssss> this place is so close to work it is a shame i had forgotten about it . <sssss> very friendly service , and ... i went for a gyro pita , with salad . <sssss> it was very tasty , lots of meat . <sssss> i even had some left overs for a late snack at work . <sssss> hubby got the gyro pita too , with fries . <sssss> really good too . <sssss> looking forward to go back , hopefully soon : -rrb- 
5		new orleans sno ball is extremely convenient , inexpensive , and tasty . <sssss> the owner says he uses pure ice blocks , which is why his product is better than his competitors ' . <sssss> for $ 2.50 you get a medium -lrb- 12 ounce ? -rrb- <sssss> cup of sno , which never loses flavor . <sssss> i got the tiger 's blood flavor -lrb- berries with a hint of coconut -rrb- and i highly recommend it . 
5		yummy food ! <sssss> i like that they have different beers and drinks that you ca n't always find in other restaurants . 
5		gwen at az fun services knows how to throw a party ! <sssss> she was so helpful matching our group with just the right carnival games . <sssss> i 've never seen so many classic , well built games in one place ! 
5		this place is legit . <sssss> straight-up dive pool hall . <sssss> and i love it . <sssss> i came here with a friend for the first time last week to shoot some pool . <sssss> the place was pretty busy and it seemed to have a good amount of regulars . <sssss> one guy even offered to help us out since it was our first time there . <sssss> get here early if you want a 8-foot table . <sssss> best part - to get a rack for a table is only $ 3 for the entire night ! <sssss> we showed up around 10 and since the tables were taken , we jumped on a 7 foot table and played a few . <sssss> the drinks were good and cheapish and the bartender was really friendly - always adds a star in my book . <sssss> i 'll definitely be back here . 
5		we ended up at olive & ivy as a 2nd - or 3rd choice due to our lateness in making a reservation for a party of 8 during the month of march . <sssss> we made the reservation about 9 days in advance . <sssss> we ended up with a primo indoor table on a saturday night -lrb- a full house -rrb- . <sssss> we were extremely pleased with the location , ambiance , service , wine list , and the food . <sssss> the dishes were spectacular . <sssss> i had the best sea scallops -lrb- with sweet polenta -rrb- that i have ever eaten . 
5		a lot of people mentioned the wait here , but i went during lunch and there was none at all . <sssss> their bread was not very good , but luckily , my appetizer came quickly . <sssss> handmade mozzarella , tomato , basil , and olive oil ... delicious ! <sssss> i have n't had mozzarella that good in ... well ... ever . <sssss> my mouth is watering just thinking about it . <sssss> i ordered 2 different pizzas because i wanted to try a variety : the margherita and the wise guy . <sssss> the crust is soooooooooooooooo good . <sssss> it 's thin and crispy so it adds the perfect texture without taking anything away from the actual taste of the pizza . <sssss> i could eat the margherita every single day . <sssss> the wise guy , on the other hand , was rather bland . <sssss> i took it to go so that i could add some spice to it when i got home . <sssss> figured it would be pretty insulting to them and embarrassing for me to ask if they had tabasco or sriracha sauce , haha . <sssss> http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/psqfynh1vxkfsmehrxlzww?select=o45qsglfasosq3rljfbwiw#nktxshmspfevp7lx9brmdg not sure if i 'll drive from la just to eat here again , but i will definitely be looking for an excuse to head in this direction . 
5		drove past for years , ate there first time last week . <sssss> delicious . <sssss> high quality . <sssss> i 'll definitely be back ! 
5		amazing everything . 
5		@quinterogolf we are so happy to have tom 's thumb in the neighborhood of our corporate office . <sssss> it is the best place for bbq . <sssss> the wonderful part is your car is cleaned while you eat ! 
5		i want to live here . <sssss> my mom and aunt took me here for a birthday lunch . <sssss> we walked in and i was in love . <sssss> it was just as it said , all luxe . <sssss> they sat us in a booth in the bar and at first i thought , gee great , we look like boozers . <sssss> then i went to the restroom and saw the other seating . <sssss> not bad , but much more crowded and not nearly as intimate as our area . <sssss> the waitress was efficient but did n't hover . <sssss> then came the food . <sssss> first of all , it took us twenty minutes to decide what to have because everything sounded great . <sssss> the menu said they are owned by cheesecake factory and it 's kinda obvious . <sssss> similar feel but on a grander scale . <sssss> not so `` shi-shi '' that you 're uncomfortable . <sssss> just lots of great little touches in decor . <sssss> i love the lighting . <sssss> if i could have pulled a lamp off the wall and shoved it in my purse i would have . <sssss> now , the food . <sssss> i ordered the half chicken salad sandwhich and a cup of cream of chicken and mushroom soup . <sssss> i thought this would be a small meal . <sssss> wrong . <sssss> it was giant . <sssss> the sandwhich was stacked sky high with perfect chicken salad . <sssss> not too mushy . <sssss> and the soup , the best i 've ever had . <sssss> seriously . <sssss> i almost bought some to go . <sssss> mine also came with a salad on the plate . <sssss> not as large as a side salad but just enough to compliment the meal and the italian dressing was really great . <sssss> my mom had the asian chicken salad and loved it . <sssss> my aunt had half a pizza and it was also huge . <sssss> she also loved hers . <sssss> we of course were too stuffed to have a dessert , but they offer the basic cheesecake factory dishes and a few specials all their own . <sssss> will have to go back for drinks and dessert . <sssss> ca n't wait ! 
5		hello friends , today i found myself hungry before an appointment off the 51 and bell road . <sssss> i remembered a small coffee shop right nearby and drove there to see what was in store . <sssss> little did i know , mocha bianca , has much in store for those with an appetite for good food and drink ! <sssss> outside , mocha bianca is very unassuming . <sssss> it is within a small shopping plaza , but their sign will stand out to you from the road . <sssss> upon entering i was immediately greeted by their staff . <sssss> their establishment has a very cozy coffee shop feel - complete with sofas , dining tables and local artist 's artwork on their walls . <sssss> they also offer free wireless internet . <sssss> their menu is plentiful ! <sssss> at mocha bianca , one can order breakfast or lunch . <sssss> they have a complete coffee bar , where they can make specialty coffee drinks for you . <sssss> i went with my usual standard of late , the caramel machiatto . <sssss> all i can say , delicious . <sssss> generous caramel and what seemed to be an extra shot of espresso , i find myself flying this afternoon . <sssss> :-rrb- they sure can give starbucks a run for their money ! <sssss> if coffee is not your standard , you can also purchase tea frappes , coffee-free drinks , or smoothies made with real pureed fruit . <sssss> for their food menu , they have bagels and various breakfast sandwiches for their breakfast customers . <sssss> for lunch , one can choose one of their various hot or cold sandwiches , as well as their chicago style hot dogs . <sssss> salads are also available for those craving a lighter fare . <sssss> on this particular day , i opted for one of their daily specials , a bean and cheese burrito with green chilies . <sssss> the burrito had just enough `` kick '' to it , along with it being a modest serving not to be overwhelming . <sssss> their staff is most accommodating and friendly . <sssss> if only major chains like starbucks would take a lesson from mocha bianca . <sssss> they know how to do service with more than a smile , heartfelt service , and delicious food and drink . <sssss> i look forward to dining at mocha bianca again very soon ! 
5		this is definitely our new favorite breakfast spot and we 've introduced a lot of friends to it as well . <sssss> the food is always good and the servers are fast and friendly . <sssss> love the coffee . <sssss> love the breakfast tacos . <sssss> love the protein shakes . <sssss> yes , you 'll probably have to wait for a table at peak times , but if you 're a regular to old town you should be used to that . <sssss> it 's worth it . 
5		my fav is the chicken tikka masala and their seasoned rice . <sssss> their samosas choley is good w / the red sauce . <sssss> i will work for this stuff . <sssss> -lrb- frequneter -rrb- the gal that serves us water is super fast and efficient . <sssss> my fav server is suaznne -lrb- sp ? -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> she 's fast , outgoing , friendly , gets stuff done . <sssss> chicken tikka masala 14.95 seasoned rice 2.95 -lrb- ? -rrb- <sssss> samosas choley 6.95 i blow my paycheque here cuz the stuff i order above is yumminess . <sssss> i like the open atmosphere of this place . <sssss> they got belly dancing performances -lrb- dancer walks around shaking it while you eat -rrb- fridays 7:30 pm ish . <sssss> just remember they are closed mondays , and have specific operating times for lunch -lrb- i think noon to 2:30 ? -rrb- 
5		at the time of our visit , solo trattoria has barely been open 6 months . <sssss> it is located in an upscale business complex of beautiful , tall buildings and surrounded by high end hotels and condos and other restaurants . <sssss> the restaurant is a bit tricky to find , but if you let gps do its job and you park your car in the parking structure behind the buildings , you will find a map near the elevator to steer you to their location inside the complex . <sssss> the restaurant will validate your ticket . <sssss> this family-owned trattoria has a nice history of restaurant experience in the chicago area . <sssss> a charming , intimate venue , the menu is small and developed with seasonal considerations . <sssss> the servings are on the small side too , but are intended to be like tapas , satisfying without feeling overstuffed . <sssss> a very talented chef , chef craig apparently is a guy who loves to play with his food . <sssss> he creates great complex sauces , has beautiful platings , works with local ingredients , and devotes a lot of time to making his dishes unique and from scratch . <sssss> the restaurant owners , chef , our very professional server , debbie , and the remainder of staff were all helpful and friendly , a welcoming vibe with great possibilities . <sssss> we were encouraged to let the chef show off by going with his tasting menu . <sssss> an excellent deal , you make a choice of either 3 , 4 or 5 courses . <sssss> we decided on a 4 course dinner @ $ 40 pp -lrb- that means $ 10 each course -rrb- . <sssss> since there were two of us , this meant we got to share 8 different dishes , no duplications . <sssss> mr. b also went with the wine pairing option . <sssss> he was given 4 glasses of wine , each selected for his 4 platings , a decent pour with each , for an additional $ 20 . <sssss> the chef 's tasting played out like this . <sssss> antipasti : - crisp pork belly on white beans and a hummus smear . <sssss> simple , tender , the three slices of belly were delicious and left me wanting more . <sssss> wine pairing - a verdicchio that hinted of a malvasia . <sssss> - butternut squash soup topped with roasted pumpkin seeds and saba -lrb- a sweet syrup made from grape must -rrb- . <sssss> complex flavors -lrb- unlike a very boring version i had the day before -rrb- , my only complaint was it was slightly overly salted . <sssss> it really was a lovely soup . <sssss> pasta : - malloreddus -lrb- a sardinian gnocchi made with semolina -rrb- - this had a pomodoro sauce with a judicious amount of schreiner 's italian sausage , topped with arugula and pecorino . <sssss> i loved the sauce . <sssss> so , so rich , the sausage ingredient was also perfect . <sssss> while not a fan of this gnocchi , my main complaint was again the degree of salt . <sssss> wine pairing - a rose . <sssss> - spaghetti alla chitarra - a thick spaghetti noodle tossed in a white sauce that was seasoned with white pepper and grana padana . <sssss> simply loved it . <sssss> entree : - braised beef on a creamy risotto . <sssss> a good dish , slow cooked to tenderness . <sssss> wish it were less lean , but that is a personal preference . <sssss> wine pairing - a cabernet . <sssss> - salmon on fennel lentils and seared brussel sprouts . <sssss> the salmon was served with a crispy skin and simply salted . <sssss> usually not into salmon skin , i was hooked this time . <sssss> the salmon was perfectly cooked and was fresh tasting . <sssss> the brussel sprouts , slightly too salty . <sssss> dessert : - oatmeal stout panna cotta . <sssss> this was presented over a cranberry jam , then a house made granola sprinkled on top . <sssss> good . <sssss> wine pairing - lambrusco . <sssss> - pumpkin budino with whipped cream and a caramel bourbon sauce drizzle . <sssss> a delicate spiced pudding cake , not unlike a soufflé . <sssss> yum . <sssss> a nice ending . <sssss> i find it particularly amusing that i would be passing on this word of advice considering i am one who loves a good salty snack and will reach for the salt shaker frequently . <sssss> my advice would be to request the chef go more lightly on the salt whenever possible . <sssss> while far from unpalatable , his dishes could have been so much more satisfying if the diner could decide on the final salting at their table . <sssss> all in all , a nice romantic meal , but with minor set backs that are so easy to fix . <sssss> it was auspicious to be introduced via groupon . <sssss> i made reservations using open table -lrb- got 1,000 points , folks -rrb- , got an additional free dessert -lrb- they even made it to-go -rrb- by doing a yelp check-in , and free parking . <sssss> good deal . <sssss> 4.5 stars ! <sssss> post script : a day later , i dug into my take-home prize , the tiramisu -lrb- my free yelp check-in dessert -rrb- . <sssss> there are many versions of tiramisu , and this one is one of the best , no cutting corners . <sssss> layers of a soaked light cake , mascapone , and deep rich espresso and coffee liquor flavors , but then , i am guessing . <sssss> i am still regretting that i had to share it . <sssss> molto bene ! <sssss> yes , yelp friends , this is a must try ! 
5		best thai food i 've had , and has great service ! 
5		you have to take price into consideration and for 7.99 dinner buffet this place has all the `` essentials '' for chinese food . <sssss> great customer service as well . 
5		i had always wanted to try a brazilian wax but was too scared to go through with it . <sssss> then , in a moment of bravery , i bought a living social deal for wax on wax off . <sssss> deyna made the experience a snap . <sssss> she was very professional and did an amazing job . <sssss> while uncomfortable -lrb- let 's face it , that is a tender area -rrb- , i did not find it as excruciating as i had heard it would be . <sssss> i think her prices are very fair , she knows her trade very well and is a truly awesome person . <sssss> i highly recommend her ! 
5		been here a few times and have not had a bad experience . <sssss> very good selection of beer . <sssss> the menu is limited and the servings are small but everything is delicious . <sssss> the one ca n't miss item : bacon wrapped dates . <sssss> i actually dropped in before a suns game and in the spirit of the upcoming event had a hotdog . <sssss> not your backyard-barbecue-type flair , but great nonetheless . <sssss> get there early , as others have noted , because seating is limited and naturally goes quickly . 
5		i needed some supplements for my basenji and called all over town looking for it . <sssss> no one had it-no one except for ray 's ! <sssss> it was only $ 13.00 super helpful , super friendly , ca n't wait to come back and browse . <sssss> going to buy my shots here too instead of paying outrageous prices at the vet . <sssss> ca n't say enough good things about these guys . 
5		this place is five stars . <sssss> as a connoisseur of coffee houses i 've visited everyone single one in tempe and phoenix and this place is the best . <sssss> plenty of seating , lighting is great , plenty of places to plug in , great coffee . <sssss> to top it all off the tea drinks are unique and come in variety ! <sssss> all the staff are wonderful , down-to-earth , professional . 
5		holy.crap . <sssss> the best , ever . <sssss> i love their hot dogs ! <sssss> omg !!!!!!!!!!!! <sssss> i could eat their hot lady dog everyday forever and be happy . <sssss> a delicious spicy hot dog , on a naan bread , topped with chipotle cream cheese and all sorts of other delicousness . <sssss> so good ! <sssss> i should have gotten two . <sssss> one to eat , one to go . 
5		this is easy the best indian food in town . <sssss> couple that with very friendly service and add in a pinch of reasonable prices and you have indian paradise . <sssss> oh almost forgot one of my favorite parts , cricket on the big screen 
5		i am in love with this pizza . <sssss> i love the crust ! <sssss> i ca n't eat cheese or meat so i ordered a veggie pizza without the cheese and it was heavenly ! <sssss> i wish there was one closer to where i live . 
5		love that we found this place heading up to sedona . <sssss> i ordered the lox/cream cheese / caper bagel . <sssss> amazing ! <sssss> seriously , it was stacked super high with salmon ! <sssss> the bagels themselves were awesome - no holes ! <sssss> we wondered , are people selling bagel holes now also ?? <sssss> bf had the ham/cheese sandwich . <sssss> he devoured it ! <sssss> it was super fresh , fast , and delicious ! <sssss> would defientely come back ! 
5		man i have always loved their food !!!! <sssss> my fav is the all you can eat beef ribs !!!! <sssss> those are the best !!! 
5		if it were n't for triple d -lrb- diners , drive-ins and dives -rrb- , i would n't have visited this place when i went to go see rent at asu . <sssss> however , this was probably one of my favorite parts of the excursion . <sssss> i ordered the ahi tuna sandwich for myself and accidentally ordered the ahi salad for my friend who hates fish . <sssss> she ate every last bite of her meal . <sssss> the sandwich was just as wonderful , but i could always use a little more kick from the wasabi -lrb- being the heat junky that i am -rrb- . <sssss> we also ordered the veggie pizza which i was lucky to get a slice of since the table devoured -lrb- with good reason -rrb- before i had my chance to attack . <sssss> we ordered all the different fries they have . <sssss> sweet potato and the garlic were my favorite . <sssss> however , you have to eat the garlic when it 's fresh , since the oil gives the fries a slightly rancid taste if it sits too long . <sssss> finally , i had to have desert -lrb- although i do n't know where i found the room for it -rrb- , a chocolate shake . <sssss> it was your typical shake , but with the temperature in arizona , it did wonders to cool me down . <sssss> when we were done , we looked at the farmers market and the houses in agritopia . <sssss> i have to say these people have one of the best places to live . <sssss> although i do n't like the sun too much , i could easily be convinced to become an arizonan for this ! 
5		so i 'm usually not one for the whole pothead marketing scheme , which we 've all seen many a cheba hut try to pull off , but two hippies is doing it right . <sssss> the biggest difference is that their food is actually worth eating when you do n't have the munchies . <sssss> the place is tiny but they 've given you a place or two to sit down . <sssss> it is filled with all of the psychedelics that you would expect and that you can think of . <sssss> but remember this place is all about the goods . <sssss> the magic mushroom burger is a must if you like shrooms at all ... the combination with the steak burger , cheese and `` liquid sunshine sauce '' puts a taste in your mouth that is honestly a little surreal . <sssss> i was lucky enough to score my burger , fries and coke for a 5 spot flat . <sssss> they also have some very special brownies that are a tasty treat after you 've put down the goods . <sssss> but they are quick to let you know ... `` do n't tell anyone where you bought them . '' <sssss> they 've just extended their hours to 9pm so stop by for lunch or dinner and i promise you 'll get rocked . 
5		seriously , ikea has everything you need when it comes to getting the necessities for a new home , college student or kids room . <sssss> yeah , its not always the best quality stuff but the selection is amazing . <sssss> the place is a giant maze but its to the point where we know our way around now . <sssss> i 'm sick of the snoody losers bashing this place for the quality . <sssss> if you do n't know this place is like most stores where there are tiers of quality , you are retarded . <sssss> its like any other store , the real cheap stuff is cheap and the more expensive stuff is better quality . <sssss> we have had our 2 leather couches for 2 years and they are sturdy as a rock and would n't trade them for anything . <sssss> our office desk and our credenza are awesome as well . <sssss> if you are looking for quality you have to pay for it , even at ikea . <sssss> i love this place . <sssss> not to mention the food ! 
5		great patio spot !!! <sssss> lots of menu options ! 
5		this guy makes the best stuff . <sssss> i love the bureks ! <sssss> our fav is the spinach ! <sssss> french bread is wonderful . <sssss> do get there early . 
5		i 've been going to dr. peterson since he opened his practice , many , many years ago . <sssss> prior to dr. peterson , 've always dreaded going to the dentist , but now i actually look forward to my appointments . <sssss> dr. peterson and his staff are always very friendly and professional , they treat my husband and i like family . <sssss> amy , the hygientist , does an excellent job of cleaning my teeth while being very gentle . <sssss> i ca n't tell you how many i 've been to that are so rough that your teeth hurt for days afterwards . <sssss> i ca n't say enough about what a wonderful find dr. peterson was .

5		absolutely the best brunch buffet i have seen . <sssss> the $ 60/person price tag was a bit scary but definitely worth it . <sssss> the service is amazing and each server treats every guest as their own . <sssss> the view is spectacular especially during the spring and summer when you can truly enjoy the beautiful weather and scenery . <sssss> live music on the weekends which certainly enhances the dining experience . <sssss> i do n't even know where to begin with the food ! <sssss> inside there is an omlette station where the chef even prepares waffles , french toast and pancakes . <sssss> there is bacon , sausage , hash browns and oatmeal along with cheese blintzes -lrb- heavenly with the accompaning strawberry sauce -rrb- . <sssss> moving more towards the patio , there is a set up with an assortment of fresh cheeses and meats including , but not limited to , brie , goat , manchego , aged cheddar , smoked salmon , beef carpaccio and so on and so on . <sssss> there is an array of fresh fruit including pineapple , rasberries , blackberries , strawberries , melons , grapes etc. . <sssss> the raw bar has blackened ahi , shrimp cocktail , snow crab claws and more . <sssss> outside , there is a prime rib carving station , fresh crab cakes , filet mignon medallions , swordfish , snapper , shrimp scampi and scallops . <sssss> there is a pasta station where a woman mixes in desired toppings with a marinara or an alfredo sauce . <sssss> next to her a lovely woman makes homemade tortillas which she makes into quesadillas or tacos with fresh salsas and guacamole . <sssss> im sure there are many items that i am forgetting ! <sssss> moving on to dessert , there is a chocolate fountain with fruits and cookies and rice krispies to dip ! <sssss> there is also ice cream and a made to order bananas foster station . <sssss> there is also a setup of pastries and cheesecakes and cupcakes and more ! <sssss> honestly this is one of my absolute favorite brunch spots , and my boyfriend and i truly enjoy every second of this amazing feast . <sssss> of course the bottomless mimosas dont hurt ! <sssss> for special occasions this is my go to choice , or for the relaxing sunday brunch date with a significant other or a group of friends , rita 's kitchen truly caters to every group ! 
5		i have been in usa for 13 years . <sssss> i can guarantee you that this place has the best pizza i have ever eaten ! <sssss> if you are new here . <sssss> definitely try the `` every bit of everything '' pizza . <sssss> if you order a medium up size pizza you can have them split the pizza into two gourmet choices . <sssss> aside from pizza , definitely try out the kale salad . <sssss> it 's to kill for ! <sssss> their salad portion is huge . <sssss> a small salad is totally enough to split for two people as appetizer . <sssss> so do n't over order it ! <sssss> trust me on this one ! 
5		true professionals and a very reasonable price ! <sssss> i definitely got my moneys worth at two guys ! <sssss> its location is perfect for students going to asu poly as it is less than a 5 minute drive away from campus 
5		i gave my daughter a couple options when it came time to book her birthday party somewhere , and after researching online and yelp , of course , i was confident when i said we could check out the bowling alley . <sssss> we stepped one foot inside and yep , decision was made . <sssss> no `` insert name of dirty , overpriced , kid pizza arcade '' here ! <sssss> they have a birthday party office near the front door and i was given info on what they have to offer -lrb- same info online -rrb- and it was easy to call back to make arrangements . <sssss> they offer parties on saturdays and sundays , two times each day . <sssss> what was one reserved as `` midnight bowling '' back in my day , they do during the birthday party times so the kids get the excitement of black lights and neon ... no boring bowling here . <sssss> if space allows , there is open bowling going on at this time too . <sssss> cosmic bowling is where it 's at ! <sssss> we opted for the party time on a saturday , 11:15 am-12 :45 pm and got the package that includes game cards for the arcade , glow necklaces for the guests , and a souvenir bowling pin for the birthday kid . <sssss> there are many add ons that you can purchase which i initially skipped but on the day of the party we added wristbands for the bumper cars which allowed the kids unlimited rides . <sssss> our party host was chloe and she was super nice . <sssss> she had our lanes set up when we arrived , complete with name tags for each guest at their placesetting on the tables and shoes on their chairs . <sssss> she took great care of us , made sure that we had everything we wanted , made an obnoxious amount of balloon animals for the kids , and hustled things along pretty well . <sssss> an hour and a half is n't long , so she made sure to reserve a spot for us in the cafe area and out all of our items over there . <sssss> if you opt for the package with the arcade games , keep in mind that the timeframe for the party will extend past an hour and a half . <sssss> by the time we had finished with bowling , pizza , cake , and the dancing that they throw in , it was already time for the parents to pick the kids up and we had just gotten the game cards for the arcade . <sssss> had i known we would get them last i would have extended the time on the invitations so the other parents were n't waiting around . <sssss> birthday parties can get quite expensive , and after adding on extra food , a pitcher of beer -lrb- for the husband and friends -rrb- , and wristbands for the bumper cars , i spent more that i originally wanted to but after seeing the excitement on my daughter 's and her friend 's faces , it was well worth it . <sssss> we could have booked a party elsewhere and spent just as much but it would n't have been as much fun . 
5		not pretentious , not fancy ... . <sssss> . <sssss> but the food is awesome !! <sssss> found them by accident the first time before i knew they had been featured on the best thing i ever ate . <sssss> my wife and i felt welcomed even though you could tell the restaurant was filled with regulars . <sssss> straight forward menu , everything is the same price except the daily special , did i say unpretentious ? <sssss> not fast but friendly and great food , no ambiance but friendly and great food . <sssss> we have n't tried everything on the menu yet , however : fried chicken 10 chicken fried steak 10 -lrb- gravy was wonderful -rrb- catfish 10 mixed greens 10 rice & gravy 8 -lrb- sometimes not as hot as it should be -rrb- green beans & taters 10 black eyed peas 8 corn bread 10 mac & cheese 3 -lrb- sorry -rrb- . <sssss> great food from fine folks since 1964 ! 
5		went to asu for a racquetball tournament and bothered my boyfriend to take me here since i am a big fan of breweries . <sssss> lets just say this place is very good . <sssss> the moment we found a seat at the bar , the bartender came up and took our drink orders . <sssss> i mainly just wanted to come here for the beer and by beer i really just wanted to try the peach ale . <sssss> the peach ale was so good ! <sssss> it had a nice taste but was n't overly fruity which i liked . <sssss> next wee decided to order some food . <sssss> i ordered the chicken strips and my boyfriend ordered the fish and chips . <sssss> i was n't thinking anything of these items when we ordered them , just figured they would be standard bar food and would taste good with alcohol . <sssss> i was completely wrong . <sssss> the food here was amazing . <sssss> i never thought i would rave about chicken strips but they were damn good . <sssss> the fish and chips my boyfriend got were equally as good . <sssss> overall this place is great . <sssss> it was very busy when we went but well worth it . <sssss> if i am ever in the tempe area again i will definitely be heading here ! 
5		my first time at la grande orange and i really enjoyed it ! <sssss> i totally agree with all the other yelpers about the parking and pricing but also that it 's so worth it once you get in there and see all the cool stuff they have while you wait for your food . <sssss> i just tried the new lgo chicken salad sandwich and it was amazing !! <sssss> i 'll definitely be going back for more !! 
5		great pizza , if you like thin crust ... which i do ! 
5		by far one of the best menu 's in old town scottsdale . <sssss> bar food with a gourmet twist . <sssss> the mac n cheese was to die for , i even added chicken and bacon to it ! <sssss> so delicious . <sssss> the place to be on sunday mornings ! <sssss> live music , drinks for days , and beautiful people all around . <sssss> attentive staff and great service ! <sssss> overall would rate this place a 10/10 ! <sssss> if you have n't stopped by rnr , do it . <sssss> i 'll be there every sunday from now on ! 
5		nice service ! <sssss> ryan linder is the rn who runs this spot . <sssss> i went for a vaccination here and i was very pleased with the speed and friendliness of the service . <sssss> somewhere between the local urgent care clinic and getting a flu shot at walgreens , you 'll find this place . <sssss> if all you need is some minor medical service , try them first . <sssss> they 're right inside of the fry 's . <sssss> do some shopping and stop by . 
5		the friendliest beer festival ever ! <sssss> i attended this fabulous event for the second year in a row , and was not disappointed at all . <sssss> if anything , the festival has grown and if 75 different brewery vendors is not enough to wet your whistle , than you need to move on , my friend . <sssss> i was encouraged to buy my ticket for the 2013 sbf well in advance , because all of the hopheads i know were certain the thing would sell out . <sssss> i took my buddy nate h. 's advice and got myself a vip ticket which was only $ 10 more than the general admission ticket . <sssss> vip status also gets you in the gate an hour earlier than the main herd , which allows you to scope out the venue and pick and choose your battles wisely . <sssss> the weather could n't have been more perfect . <sssss> it was actually around 80f in the sun during the peak temperature -lrb- not terribly unheard of for phoenix during february , but still a bit warmer than the average -rrb- ! <sssss> fortunately , i bummed some sunblock off of some fellow light-rail passengers on the way to steele indian school park , who were obviously planning on attending this event . <sssss> these type of festivals lend themselves to some silliness , so i -lrb- and others -rrb- seem to make a great attempt to wear something unusual , if not something completely outlandish . <sssss> this makes for a great icebreaker with fellow beer-drinkers who have caught their buzz earlier than anticipated -lrb- it is a strong beer festival ... which lives up to its name -rrb- and feel the compulsion to comment on your odd wardrobe choice . <sssss> last year , i wore a wienerschnitzel bowling shirt proudly declaring `` america 's favorite wiener ! '' <sssss> and it was a hit . <sssss> this year i settled on a fez embroidered with a biohazard symbol . <sssss> i was happy to see that i did not spot one other person with a fez the whole day , so apparently i was an original . <sssss> glad to see that arizona 's craft beer scene is growing , as evidenced by the local vendors represented . <sssss> i spotted a presence by santan , papago , and four peaks , as well as relative newcomers fate , that brewery , and desert eagle . <sssss> i also got to follow up with one of my old loves , rubicon brewing in sacramento , which i sampled from the pitcher of nectar -lrb- distributors -rrb- tent . <sssss> rubicon 's black capricorn ale was a real treat , and i am so happy to see their distribution growing in az ! <sssss> i was also blown away by bell 's brewing 's -lrb- michigan -rrb- bourbon-barrel aged batch 9000 . <sssss> at 14.8 % abv , this propelled me to my peak happiness of the day . <sssss> cheers to old world for sponsoring the beeraoke tent and the ska band 2tone lizards who rocked the house . <sssss> it was an all-around good time.i love this beerfest ! 
5		it is the best buffet i have ever been to . <sssss> i normally do not like buffet style restaurants , but this one is awesome . <sssss> the place is clean and beautiful . <sssss> the food is fresh and delicious . <sssss> love this place . 
5		if the monaco focaccia was a woman i 'd leave my girlfriend , marry the monaco and produce baby monacos . <sssss> best sports bar food in town . 
5		first time here . <sssss> i got the chicken ceasar pellini . <sssss> yumm . <sssss> . <sssss> and nutella piadina for dessert . <sssss> so good , reminds me of nutella crepes . <sssss> i 'll definitely be coming back . <sssss> the guy that helped me was friendly and they give a 10 % discount if you work in the area . 
5		i have been going to little peking over ten years.this place has the most delicious chinese food . <sssss> to be honest i 'm yet to find a dish i have disliked . <sssss> staff is very friendly do n't be discouraged if you walk in and it looks a little ruff on the edges . <sssss> promise this place will not let you down . 
5		had an absolutely spectacular experience from start to finish , what a fabulous score for old town dining ! <sssss> we went for happy hour and it is by far the best happy hour in town ! <sssss> they offer a nice selection of wines by the glass for $ 5 each . <sssss> we decided to try an ample selection of appetizers to share to get a good feel for the menu . <sssss> we had the kobe sliders , the salmon bruschetta , the pulled pork sliders , the fig jam & ricotta sliders , the cesar salad , and the artichoke orzo . <sssss> the portion sizes were perfect and i ca n't say enough good things about the presentation ! <sssss> and the taste ... unbelievably good , like too good to be true good ! <sssss> we finished with a delightfully light tiramisu . <sssss> quality all the way around , by far exceeded our expectations , we will definitely be back . <sssss> the service was on par with our meal and flawless as well . <sssss> the server was attentive and witty , and the manager -lrb- owner ? -rrb- <sssss> took time to introduce himself and inquire about our experience . <sssss> if you have n't been , you must try it ! 
5		i moved from charlotte , nc and went to about 6 different nail salons looking for someone to get it right !!! <sssss> i finally found denise who i love !!! <sssss> she is awesome with everything ! <sssss> i will continue to go back !! 
5		loved this place ! <sssss> not too much in happy hour menu as far as food , but prices are pretty good without . <sssss> mac n cheese is delicious ! <sssss> bruschetta was yummy especially red pepper and gosh cheese ! 
5		first time at manuel 's and it was great . <sssss> our family sat outside on patio with misters creating comfortable atmosphere . <sssss> drinks and service was great . 
5		heard good things about the cooking and food . <sssss> went with my mom who highly recommended it . <sssss> i ordered cinnamon battered french toast . <sssss> came with fresh eggs too . <sssss> i was impressed . <sssss> huge portions and strawberries/whip cream tasted superb with the french toast . <sssss> clean fast service . <sssss> my mom had chicken tortilla soup . <sssss> i tasted and it was by far the best i 've ever tasted . 
5		great service ! 
5		hands down , crudo is one of my favorite restaurants in phoenix . <sssss> everything on their menu is phenomenal . <sssss> i highly recommend the ahi and the albacore ; the fish is so fresh and delicious that i 'm practically salivating just thinking about it . <sssss> i 've eaten in the restaurant several times as well as sitting at the bar for happy hour . <sssss> their bartender micah has got to be one of the best mixologists in phoenix , and will blow your mind with some amazing creations . <sssss> there 's been many times that i 've asked him to surprise me with a drink , and he 's put together some truly delicious off-menu cocktails . <sssss> i really do n't have enough good things to say about this restaurant . <sssss> i took my mother here once when she was visiting from san diego , and she now insists that we go here every time she 's in town . <sssss> so if you have n't been yet , go ! 
5		unfortunately i do n't get enough chances to come here but , i 'd say i have been here about a dozen times and each time i have never been let down . <sssss> the beer is great , the food is great , especially their french fries and the crowd is ok . <sssss> yes it is in tempe and you 're stuck with all the asu kids but i like to come here in the summer time or when asu is on break because it is the locals that are here . <sssss> it is not the nicest brewery that i have ever been to , but what they lack in aesthetics they make up for in beer . <sssss> a must go to place if you 're in the tempe area ! 
5		just had lunch there and it was delicious ! <sssss> i had the caprese and it was huge , i did manage to eat it all though . <sssss> my friend had the quesadilla and said that was really good too . <sssss> we shared the peanut butter cup cookie and both agreed it was hands down the best cookie we 'd ever eaten . <sssss> we also bought the crumb cake but were so full that we only took one bite each . <sssss> it was good , but nothing like that cookie ... i 'll be returning just to buy one of those ! <sssss> cons were that it was small inside , so we sat outside . <sssss> however , it is on main street so there were a lot cars . <sssss> also , some random store two doors down pulled out some giant speakers and periodically played very loud gangster rap . <sssss> those factors did not contribute to the quaint feeling we got from urban picnic . <sssss> i 'd definitely go back again , but not sit outside ! 
5		mast air repaired our system recently . <sssss> great service , arrived as expected & very helpful & knowledgeable ! <sssss> i have already referred them to two neighbors - they were fast , courteous & very thorough . <sssss> they deserve every star !! 
5		absolutely delicious . <sssss> owners and workers are extremely friendly . <sssss> steak shawerma , amazing . <sssss> seriously the best side salad i have ever had ... filled with toppings and great dressing ... 
5		sweet local dive , a tempe institution . <sssss> great place to catch a show , and good prices on drinks . <sssss> also , there are a few arcades and a pool table in the back , along with a juke box in the corner . <sssss> perfect for pregaming or for ending your night of debauchery . <sssss> check it ! 
5		cpk catered our playgroup event , and what a terrific job they did ! <sssss> their people were charming and all the food was delicious , especially the linguine , the thai chicken pizzas , and the wild field greens salad with candied nuts . 
5		i love this place ! <sssss> professional , creative , up on the latest styles and reasonably priced . <sssss> kathy does my hair & she is amazing ! <sssss> would n't dream of going anywhere else ! 
5		love everything about harkins no matter the location . <sssss> the great customer service is always consistent . 
5		teeter tots / end scene 
5		i have been here numerous times and i always thoroughly enjoy my food . <sssss> delicious healthy food that is not to expensive ... you ca n't really ask for more . <sssss> i have been to the pita jungle in tempe before and in no way does it compare to this one in ambiance . <sssss> i wish they had this exact restaurant in central phoenix right near my house ... i swear i would want to come eat here everyday . <sssss> anyway until that happens i will have to settle for driving a little out of my way to enjoy their food . <sssss> on sunday i stopped in here to pick up some takeout ... i had their hummus and taboule pita ... i had them put the red pepper hummus instead of the regular and it was sooo delicious and the perfect amount of food . <sssss> i can not wait to come back ! 
5		after almost a year since my first trip to jade bar , i returned before dining at elements . <sssss> this time my husband and i brought my in-laws on their last night in phoenix . <sssss> jade bar did not disappoint . <sssss> our server was incredibly friendly and even went searching for a fourth chair so that no one in our group had to stand . <sssss> we all stuck to pretty basic drinks , but man , were the mixed drinks strong . <sssss> i think there was just enough coke in my rum and coke to give the drink color . <sssss> 4 drinks totaled $ 41 . <sssss> jade bar is a nice pre-dinner spot or just a good place to relax while enjoying the views . 
5		i have been going to don and charlie 's since i can remember . <sssss> you are always guaranteed a fabulous meal . <sssss> in addition , don is a kind man and cares about the restaurant . <sssss> enjoy dinner and create great family memories . 
5		i 'm never disappointed at this tempe favorite . <sssss> when the weather is nice , you ca n't find a nicer outdoor dining experience . 
5		i love el sol ! <sssss> i used to work at a little bar across the street that got all of their fresh tortillas from here . <sssss> that was back when they were only a bakery . <sssss> they now have a full menu of mexican food also , and they cook as well as they bake . <sssss> we often stop for breakfast and you can taste the fresh baked tortilla that i remember from years ago wrapped into a gigantic breakfast burrito . <sssss> it 's clean and the people at the counter are beyond friendly . <sssss> thank you el sol 
5		hi craig , i 'm back in town and ca n't wait to eat at the best breakfast place in history !!! <sssss> see you soon . 
5		i have not been here yet , but will soon . <sssss> there will be a recreational soccer league this summer for my kid and from what i hear , it 's a great facility . <sssss> would like to see if they are receptive to `` competitive indoor badminton '' , the second most popular , participated and watched sport worldwide behind soccer -lrb- football -rrb- . <sssss> yes indeed ... and no i 'm not kidding . <sssss> probably entertain the idea of some exhibition/demo matches to demonstrate how much interest is generated . <sssss> hope to see it catch on ... would be a beautiful thing , and for sure add some variety and depth to local recreational and competitive choices -lrb- participation and spectator -rrb- . <sssss> just need to make the right contact the very first time ! 
5		love this park ! <sssss> great for small hikes , fishing with the kids and boot camp babes ! 
5		my favorite restaurant ! <sssss> the staff is great . <sssss> the owner is great . <sssss> you should upload a photo of that amazing person that won the photo contest !!! 
5		i absolutely love this place . <sssss> downtown gilbert has really needed a place that can make a good cocktail . <sssss> the mazaltan mule and pineapple mojito are especially delicious . <sssss> the food has been excellent . <sssss> wonderful tacos filled with very fresh fish or tender meat . <sssss> the rotisserie chicken is a very nice take on a classic american dinner . <sssss> the staff is one of the shining points of this restaurant . <sssss> all the bartenders are more than happy to serve up exotic libations with a smile . <sssss> joyride is a very welcome addition to downtown . 
5		they ca n't seem to make up their mind what to call this place ! <sssss> the sign outside says `` china king buffet '' , their business card says , `` super china king buffet '' , & when i asked the hostess about `` king buffet 2000 '' -lrb- the heading here -rrb- , she said , `` yes , that 's us too '' . <sssss> whatever the name is , this place is excellent ! <sssss> norm r. , mike c. , & i stopped in here today for lunch , & i started with some hot & sour soup that was really tops . <sssss> from there , it was on to around 90 total food choices , including mongolian barbecue & sushi . <sssss> i really enjoyed everything i had room to try , & my only regret was that i got full before i could get to everything that i wanted . <sssss> they call the dining room `` cozy '' on the front window . <sssss> to me , that would be copper kettle in tempe , not this big place , but it does have a comfortable dining room , divided into several sections & softly lit while the lighting over the food serving trays is nice & bright . <sssss> along with everything else , there were lots of fish & seafood selections , including delicious ceviche ! <sssss> -lrb- i do n't know what they 're doing with that here , but they did remember to have tostadas to put it on ! -rrb- <sssss> also , a lot of the usual things that you expect were especially good , such as the fried chicken . <sssss> there were great desserts too , & even the service was especially friendly & attentive . <sssss> all this for $ 8.99 , & seniors less . <sssss> i love '' ?? <sssss> king buffet ?? '' <sssss> & ca n't wait to go back ! 
5		i had only even been to one lady for years but needed an emergency brazilian wax and so i found her through groupon and let me tell you she is amazing ! <sssss> it was super fast easy and a well job done . <sssss> the best part was that it was nearly painless ! <sssss> will go again for sure and highly recommend . 
5		i really like this place . <sssss> it 's not the most original , the most swanky , or even the best italian food . <sssss> but here 's why i love it : no matter the occasion , no matter your mood , you walk into buca and feel great . <sssss> the old world music , the ecclectic wall decor , the smells , and all of the loud-but-happy people . <sssss> it really has an infectious atmosphere all its own . <sssss> this is the place for a group , as the portions at buca di beppo 's are huge ! <sssss> plan to order a variety of dishes and pass them around the table . <sssss> also give the homemade lemoncello a try . <sssss> delizioso ! 
5		this is one of my favorite places in phoenix . <sssss> their pizza rocks and they also have a lot of my other favorite things : burgers on english muffins , wings , shrimp ceviche , gelato , fresh lemonade , and grey goose ! <sssss> their `` shakin ' lemonade '' combines lemonade , grey goose , and a sprig of rosemary , really amazing . <sssss> if you want to enjoy some nice wine , you can select a bottle from the grocery store connected to the restaurant and enjoy it with your meal . <sssss> instead of crayons and paper , they have wikki sticks for the kids . <sssss> although parking is limited , they offer comp valet , and the valet guys are always fast and nice . <sssss> the beau and usually catch a seat at their community table . <sssss> if you 're with a group , expect to wait a bit . 
5		great food , cool setting . <sssss> this place is in sunbrite corner -lrb- nw corner of 16th & bethany home -rrb- . <sssss> no street signage i could find . <sssss> park at luci 's and it is in suite just north . <sssss> polished copper tables . <sssss> wonderful spicy breakfast dishes . <sssss> endorphins will be released ! <sssss> bloody mary was awesome and served with a beer chaser . <sssss> great for cooling off after the food , but frankly great for cooling off after the bloody mary itself . <sssss> will definitely be returning . <sssss> next time - adovada benedict . 
5		exellent choice of on tap beers . <sssss> great food . <sssss> always fresh and well prepared . <sssss> staff has been there for a long time which always says alot about the restaurant and it 's owner . <sssss> we have been going there for 7 + years . <sssss> it 's just a great place to watch a game and have a good meal . 
5		my husband and i ate here thursday night . <sssss> i had chicken skewers and veggies , and lemon roasted potatoes . <sssss> the dish was amazing . <sssss> my husband had the gyro meat platter with rice and veggies , and it was also incredible and full of flavor . <sssss> the service provided by hannah was excellent . <sssss> we are from out of town and highly recommend this restaurant . <sssss> a + thursday 6:30 pm 
5		this is the best place for late night dessert in phoenix . <sssss> $ 7 desserts with one featured every night for $ 5 . <sssss> desserts are plated so each one comes with little extras . <sssss> they are open till 11pm seven nights a week . <sssss> couple that with the view and it is a great time . <sssss> the variety of the menu items is also great : bread pudding , chocolate cake , tiramisu , pineapple upside down cake and creme brulee . <sssss> i want and will try them all !!! <sssss> service is a little slow , but when you are up there , who cares . <sssss> more time to look at the changing view . 
5		this place is off the hook . <sssss> from the smoky salsa to the portabello enchilada with a side of smoked chili 's . <sssss> robbie s. took great care of us . <sssss> the ambiance was nice , contrary to other opinions . <sssss> do n't miss this gem of a joint . <sssss> i look forward to our next visit . 
5		loving this little spot ! <sssss> the cooks are friendly , the filet kabob and basmati rice are great , and the prices are reasonable . <sssss> i hesitate to give 5 stars to a place with ambiance like a fast food type restaraunt but this place is exactly what you expect of it . <sssss> clean , quick , and remarkably tasty ! 
5		this is a `` go to '' spot for us . <sssss> always . <sssss> i have never , ever had one complaint about an experience or the food and i have had the pleasure of coming here for 5 + years regularly -lrb- weekly ? -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> great for lunch , happy hour , or dinner . <sssss> great for clients , friends or dates . <sssss> fabulous ambiance inside -lrb- always have fabulous music -rrb- or on the patio -lrb- central location is my fave -rrb- . <sssss> love the simple modern decor peppered with mid-century touches . <sssss> i 've used them for catering and it 's been a delight and clients love postino ! <sssss> nothing on the menu is the wrong choice , absolutely nothing . <sssss> incredible ingredients , impeccably chosen . <sssss> favorite bruschetta choices -lrb- you choose 4 -rrb- are : prosciutto with figs & mascarpone , ricotta with dates & pistachios , roasted peppers with goat cheese , brie & apples with fig spread . <sssss> yum ! <sssss> best starters : pub board , nyc grilled cheese -lrb- i die for that mustard -rrb- , and the butcher 's block . <sssss> favorite salad is the mixed greens , better than it sounds ! <sssss> i 've been known to come in and just have wine and order the bowl of olives for dinner , they are that good . <sssss> this is one of my happy places , if you have n't been , you must ! 
5		if anyone knows me they know my love for tiki and know my love for hulas ! <sssss> me and my husband come here at least once a week for brunch and it never gets old . <sssss> the food is great , the staff is friendly , the drinks are amazing and their happy hour ... well you ca n't find a better happy hour in town ! <sssss> if you find yourself in central phoenix and want to try a new place for some awesome grub ... stop in at hulas modern tiki ... order some tacos ... wash it down with a mai tai or a dr funk and enjoy your day ! 
5		i am not one to post a lot of reviews , and when i do i am brutally honest . <sssss> so with that in mind , i have to say that maui saito ninjitsu is by far the best and most unique program i have ever seen . <sssss> my 7 year old has been doing it for just under a year and loves it . <sssss> it is not your typical program where the kids stand in rows and practice moves of katas . <sssss> master maui teaches them unique skills that would help them if ever caught in a bad situation . <sssss> the kids are having so much fun that they do n't even realize they are getting a valuable lesson . <sssss> they are also learning how to focus when there is distraction and get out of dangerous situations . <sssss> you kind of have to see it for yourself to truly get an understanding of it . <sssss> on top of that , some of the moves they learn are amazing . <sssss> . <sssss> it does n't matter how small you are for ninjitsu to be effective . <sssss> i have seen my 7 year old take down a kid who is twice his size and weight . <sssss> it is certainly a great confidence builder and a way for kids to deal with bullies if ever put in the situation . <sssss> now on to master maui ... i can sincerely say he is one of the nicest people i have ever met and his dojo like a big family . <sssss> he is great with the kids and a fantastic teacher to say the least . <sssss> you can tell he truly cares about the kids and loves what he does . <sssss> he was taught ninjitsu by his father in hawaii , you can read the unique history on his website . <sssss> as i said , it is the kind of thing you have to see to fully get an understanding of it . <sssss> i guarantee it is not like anything you have ever seen . <sssss> we found it by chance when looking at different schools that were close to home . <sssss> i am certainly glad we did and have no doubt my son will stick with it . <sssss> i honestly ca n't say enough good things about the school or master maui ... if you are looking for a place , i could n't recommend it enough . 
5		gymboree , many years ago i brought my first son to gymboree quite often and really enjoyed . <sssss> never thought i would be back , but now we have another gymboree tike and he loves it . <sssss> i am very happy to have been reintroduced to gymboree and have already made plans to go again with my son next week . <sssss> the instructor made it look easy and really communicated very well with both parents and children . <sssss> thinking about gymboree now , my only regret is that i know someday my boy is going to outgrow it , and i want these times to last forever . 
5		oh zoyo !! <sssss> you are way too close to my house , and i am forced to visit you often and much . <sssss> i am so happy you are here !!!! <sssss> there is always plain tart - it 's a little sweeter than mojo 's , but still wonderful ! <sssss> and the toppings assortment is heavenly - fresh strawberries , blueberries , kiwi , coconut , granola , all the candy choices and nutty nuts . <sssss> oh - and $ 0.35 / oz ? <sssss> thank you for being here !!! <sssss> two requests : 1 . <sssss> more seats please 2 . <sssss> if you stamp my card , do n't restamp the same spots - because i 'm counting , and such consistent naughtiness will lead to a bad review . 
5		they are awesome ! <sssss> my fiance and his dad have been going here for years and they know how to take care of their customers . <sssss> if give it to you straight and do n't bs . <sssss> take your car here if you do n't want to get ripped off ! 
5		this was my 2nd time here , the tacos , beans and the quesadilla were great and the margaritas very good as well . <sssss> this is one of my new stops while downtown . <sssss> i love the little house that has been transformed into the fun place to eat . <sssss> i took 7 people to a quick lunch everyone rave about the experience . 
5		i still think this a great place to go if you want to enjoy a movie . <sssss> looking at 6.75 per adult and $ 1 for kids younger than 11 . <sssss> we brought camping chairs and sat in front of the car while the kiddos enjoyed sitting in a truck bed . <sssss> another great feature is that you can bring your own food and drinks . <sssss> what a great family night place . <sssss> you can bring your kids , watch 2 movies and bring dinner . <sssss> that is a cheap family night out . <sssss> if you are looking for a new experience or a inexpensive go out night this is your place . 
5		i love the food here , and great great service . <sssss> i love to sit on the patio in the spring , it is a very nice atmosphere . <sssss> plenty of good food to choose from on the menu and the portions and sides are generous for the prices . <sssss> never had a margarita so ca n't judge that but the beer tastes good . 
5		chocolate dreams . <sssss> sometimes the very best things come from dreams . <sssss> julia baker 's dream was to make sure that the very best chocolate was available to everyone . <sssss> her dream was not a small one ; nor one that was easily accomplished . <sssss> but it was there and it was so real that it overshadowed the other successful parts of her life . <sssss> how do i know this about her chocolate dream ? <sssss> because she is not one to skimp on words . <sssss> she tells it like it is . <sssss> she lays it all out there for all to see . <sssss> she tells a story that started with her dream and that story has grown into more than just one woman 's dream ; but has grown into the dream of many from arizona to ghana . <sssss> that dream has become the reality of chocolate farming . <sssss> chocolate confections . <sssss> chocolate truffles . <sssss> chocolate martinis . <sssss> chocolate pralines . <sssss> french sipping chocolate . <sssss> chocolate mousse cake . <sssss> red velvet chocolate truffles . <sssss> white chocolate . <sssss> milk chocolate . <sssss> dark chocolate . <sssss> chocolate dreams . <sssss> chocolate . <sssss> sweet chocolate . <sssss> sweet , sweet chocolate . <sssss> this is what sweet dreams are made of ... sweet julia with the chocolate dreams . <sssss> www.juliabakerconfections.com 
5		the staff at ide mania is wonderful and very professional . <sssss> they take of their clients and see to it that you are always leave satisfied . <sssss> there is never a too-good-for-you attitude which you will find at other establishments . <sssss> amina call always does her very best . <sssss> she is intelligent and can hold a great conversation , all while making you look great . <sssss> her talents with scissors is reflected in her work and i highly recommend both amina call and ide mania . 
5		i have nothing bad to say about nordstrom especially the one in fashion square scottsdale . <sssss> they always have the best customer service and friendly staff ! <sssss> i love the great finds here , even in the juniors section for us small girls/ladies ! <sssss> the only thing is that i wish their `` high-end '' shoe department sold more high-end shoes , common louboutins !!! 
5		i 've never really been a fan of diners , drive-ins and dives , however when i saw the segment featuring los taquitos i had to go . <sssss> absolutely the finest , most delicious wonderful mexican food i have ever experienced . <sssss> the staff , professional , hard-working and courteous . <sssss> they are so proud of their business and for good reason . <sssss> that made me smile . <sssss> i 'm definitely a permanent customer . <sssss> everything was fantastic ! 
5		just walk in and order the truth . <sssss> you will get the best hot sandwich made . <sssss> gordon and mary are the nicest people . 
5		a friend and i had a delightful experience here . <sssss> we ordered an avocado roll and pad thai . <sssss> the avocado roll was simply to die for . <sssss> it was soft and creamy - and i 'm including the rice in this , too . <sssss> it was an avocado roll all other avocado rolls should bow down to . <sssss> it slid down the throat so deliciously gracefully , an addiction was created in one bite . <sssss> and the pad thai we ordered with chicken instead of shrimp . <sssss> another wow moment . <sssss> sweet and savory , melting in the mouth , just the right bit of everything , and an abundant portion of it . <sssss> will definitely return for more . 
5		what i love - your delicious and bountiful flavors . <sssss> - comfy chairs that i can sit back on for hours - free wifi = great study spot - variety of seating . <sssss> indoors or outdoors . <sssss> outdoor seating is under a tarp , so the temperature is regulated . <sssss> - your shakes ! <sssss> why you bother me - cravings that ca n't be satisfied because i live too far from you - i compare other gelato places to you and end up not as satisfied . <sssss> the glass does n't look half as full - i ca n't say no to you . 
5		i went back to @nmtbrew tonight , because it 's really that amazing . <sssss> amy was our server . <sssss> she quickly informed us that the guest brew , the pumpkin porter , was out , and that they had just that hour tapped the mountain stout . <sssss> i sampled it , as well as their mild child , a `` succulent blonde '' . <sssss> the blonde was nice , but it 's beginner beer . <sssss> the stout , however , definitely for refined palettes . <sssss> just had some crab dip for dinner . <sssss> was very pleasantly surprised to have a visit from owner/brewmaster rob , who came to discuss the stout . <sssss> we discussed many different things , and i congratulated him on he , and candy 's success with their venture . <sssss> sitting on the patio was initially a bit warm , but by the time we left , it was a nice night . <sssss> ca n't get enough of this place ! 
5		ahmad is amazing ! <sssss> go to him if you need anything ! <sssss> he 's so nice and so helpful ! <sssss> five stars all the way , soley based on his amazing customer service ! <sssss> : -rrb- 
5		my 11 year old son took part in ` kids fun run ' . <sssss> everything was organized very well . <sssss> he loved the experience and is all hooked up for his next runs . <sssss> he loved the medal too . 
5		as a former vegetarian/vegan , i 've recently been discovering the -lrb- full , not substitutions or single-option style -rrb- menus of my favorite places . <sssss> the vegetarian platter at this place is so good , though , that i really do n't even have that desire . <sssss> okay , maybe i 'm game for the chicken stew with a hard-boiled egg as an option , but come on . <sssss> it 's a stewed hard-boiled egg . <sssss> how could i not ? <sssss> misir wat , the red lentil stew , is by far the tastiest thing on the vegetarian menu , but the gomen and fosolia -lrb- greens and green beans , respectively -rrb- , are also good , and completely different . <sssss> each dish is seasoned differently , so the platters offer flavors that really compliment each other -lrb- rather than blending -rrb- . <sssss> no garlic overload or trite use of the same spices over and over . <sssss> the greens are definitely sporting some garlic , but the green beans are sweet and light . <sssss> everything is stewed here , but the variety of meats and vegetables allows that . <sssss> plus , i think i read somewhere it 's traditional ? <sssss> : -rrb- salads are unimaginative , the vinaigrette is just that -lrb- but goes well with the bread , as vinaigrette tends to do -rrb- , one tomato wedge per person rule seems to apply . <sssss> i wish someone would ban iceberg from restaurants . <sssss> bread is amazing , spongy and sour . <sssss> soup is good , a bit salty , very thick and noodly . <sssss> when low on cash , that plus one stew will do you ok . <sssss> beers are ethiopian , as is the wine . <sssss> i 've tried both beers and the white wine they had , i favored the harar beer with my meal . 
5		tiffany haynes is a realtor that i can highly recommend . <sssss> she has been in the real estate business for many years and has the knowledge and experience needed in this industry . <sssss> she has developed a reliable team of contacts . <sssss> she is especially knowledgeable for canadians buying in the united states . <sssss> tiffany is always willing to go the extra mile ! 
5		went to fez last night 1/27/12 before a show at the orpheum . <sssss> the parking lot was full but eventually found metered parking on the street just south of the restaurant . <sssss> everybody we came into contact with seemed nice and genuine -lrb- host and server -rrb- . <sssss> the food was tasty tan-tan chicken sandwich crispy panko chicken breast with a baba ganoush spread , green olives , oven roasted tomatoes , spinach and bell pepper aioli on ciabatta . <sssss> i think a good ciabatta bread could make just about anything taste good though . <sssss> my wife got the fez kisra flat herb bread pizza with grilled chicken , spicy honey molasses bbq , red onions , spiced pears , cilantro & manchego cheese , very tasty as well menu says serves 1-2 people i think it can easily serve 2-3 we brought some home . <sssss> glad i finally made it to fez and will be coming back . 
5		the food and beer here is the same as at any other bj 's location -- consistently solid . <sssss> the customer service at this location is excellent , however . <sssss> my friend spilled her beer while trying to maneuver into the booth , and the manager not only replaced the beer , but found her a bj 's t-shirt in the back to wear home . <sssss> totally above and beyond the call of duty . 
5		i was taken on a date here for a late dinner and the place is great ! <sssss> i love the ambiance , and the lighting is perfect for date night . <sssss> the male servers are hot . <sssss> like really hot . <sssss> hahahah we started off with the guacamole and salsa is better than i 've had a most restaurants . <sssss> i ordered the grilled swordfish tacos , which was labeled as `` guaranteed best in town '' um , that couldnt be more true . <sssss> the best swordfish tacos i 've ever had , and the servings were huge . <sssss> if it wasnt a first date , i would of took a picture of my dish . <sssss> but i didnt want him to know about my yelp addiction just yet . <sssss> cause i mean ... i 've definitely got a problem . <sssss> hahaha a must try for dinner ! <sssss> i really want to come back for brunch on the patio though . 
5		after 3 trips -lrb- original plus and 2 revisions -rrb- to a big-box home improvement store that is way too far from our house for all that driving , my fiance finally decides -lrb- after i told him in a very ladylike fashion that i was through with this project -rrb- to look elsewhere for custom-cut glass top panels for some wood shelves we -lrb- he -rrb- wanted to build and requested some quotes . <sssss> spoiler : supporting local business is the way to go !!! <sssss> roadrunner 's quote was about 50 % cheaper than the others we received . <sssss> customer service was incredibly friendly and professional , and the order was completed in a few days . <sssss> the glass fit perfectly atop those godforsaken shelves that we -lrb- he -rrb- dreamed up , and now we can step back and admire . <sssss> they even sanded the edges for safety . <sssss> should we attempt another home improvement project in the future and it involves glass , i will gently remind him that we -lrb- we -rrb- will be hiring a professional , and it will be roadrunner . 
5		great venue , also a really nice place to hang out and grab some drinks and food . 
5		this place is the very definition of a hole in the wall . <sssss> in fact it 's wedged in between an appliance repair store and a trash can . <sssss> there are 5 tables in the place and one outside . <sssss> but do n't let the interior fool you . <sssss> the sole employee i ever see working here is very kind and energetic . <sssss> they serve beer and wine which is always a plus in these hole in the walls . <sssss> the food is great and hearty . <sssss> every dish comes with at least 2 other things they throw in a cup for you . <sssss> my favorite thing here is the argentina carne asada . <sssss> but beware , it is hot . <sssss> the ceviche is the best i have had in phoenix and the pork empanadas are great appetizers . <sssss> all in all i would recommend this place to anyone . <sssss> there is `` safe '' food there so you can bring your squeamish friends there to kick their taco bell habits and just enough outside the norm food to please the experimental side in us all . <sssss> pricing is great too . <sssss> easily 5 stars if i ever seen one . 
5		if you ever want to instantly `` up '' your cool factor with a friend or date , meet them at the lost leaf . <sssss> the mere fact that there is no external sign -lrb- other than the tacky `` open '' sign indicating that it is , indeed , the lost leaf -rrb- you would probably never have any idea that the best neighborhood bar in phoenix is inside . <sssss> when i am asked to describe the lost leaf to someone who has never been before , it is basically a big open house with the most well-stocked beer fridge you have ever seen . <sssss> no cocktails or draft , but for atmosphere and quality of beer selection , lost leaf is by far my favorite place to meet people in dtown phoenix . 
5		this video store rocks ! <sssss> first of all , the fact that there is a video store in my area is a miracle nowadays . <sssss> second of all , they have all the classics plus new releases . <sssss> thirdly , the pricing and all the deals are the greatest incentive to keep coming back ! 
5		i am a volunteer with a nonprofit that helps moms & babies breastfeed . <sssss> we were in need of a cake to help thank the volunteers in az and honey moon sweets was kind enough to donate a lovely , delicious cake for the event . <sssss> i have returned many times -lrb- as have many of the other women who enjoyed their delicious creation -rrb- and i will be back many more . 
5		amf frontier lanes got an entire over-haul since the last time i was there -lrb- about 2 years ago -rrb- . <sssss> i never understood why bowling alleys were n't modernized and de-stinked and frontier lanes is the first bowling alley that i have seen that has been remodeled . <sssss> it 's clean . <sssss> the bathrooms were n't scary and it smelled absolutely fine in there . <sssss> we went to the cosmic bowl on friday night . <sssss> it was a ton of fun . <sssss> 10pm-1am - $ 18/person 3 hours of bowling and shoes . <sssss> the lights go down and the music goes up ... video screens and $ 18 pitchers -- good times . <sssss> the staff is nice too , which is a shocker to me b/c most of the time , in the past my experiences with bowling staff has been less than stellar . <sssss> on a side note , there was n't any food , so make sure you eat prior to bowling if you do the 10pm - 1am thing . <sssss> the snack bar was closed . <sssss> bowling is fun . 
5		i 've tried about 5 different barbers since i moved to az from boston . <sssss> this is the only place that i 've been to more than once . <sssss> i 've been about 8 times . <sssss> they have been incredibly consistent in listening to what i wanted . <sssss> also , they do free neck shaving if you are in between cuts . 
5		a whole month later and i am still loving this place . <sssss> it is my new top phoenix gyro spot . <sssss> i have seen it packed the past few times i have been in . <sssss> i have also gotten a few friends and coworkers addicted . <sssss> love . <sssss> seriously , if you love gyros , try this place . <sssss> it 's a hole in the all but seriously , amazing ! <sssss> their $ 6.99 meal deal can not be beat ! <sssss> -lrb- i 'm having cravings as i write ... -rrb- long live authentic gyros ! <sssss> : - -rrb- 
5		what an experience ! <sssss> super cool vibe , laid back server and the food - to die for . <sssss> i had a burger with a side salad and a margarita . <sssss> not only did i have a margarita , but i ordered them from a menu that featured several different kinds of margarita . <sssss> it was happy hour still , so that made them taste even better . <sssss> the place is trendy - lots of artists , gay folks and tree huggers but also groups of friends and business dinners happening . <sssss> really great ! 
5		i was a little surprised i must say to see that joes for some here got such low scores . <sssss> yes i guess the flies and the noise can be a bit bothersome , but for me it is all about the food and that is awesome ! <sssss> i absolutely love love the onion rings there . <sssss> it is hard to find really good onion rings these days . <sssss> i had family recently come in and we had so much food on the table i was afraid someone was going to start oinking at us . <sssss> fried zucchinni is also probably the very best i have ever had and the fries ! <sssss> awesome ! <sssss> how do they get them so crispy ? <sssss> fontina burger is amazing ! <sssss> i will definitely keep going there ! 
5		we drive from scottsdale just to have juan 's food ! <sssss> if you are looking for 5 star atmosphere , not here , but if you are looking for 5 star food . <sssss> you are in the right place !!! <sssss> this phoenix restaurant is family owned - mom runs the kitchen , daughters run front of house with mom and dad and the brother run back of house -lrb- except for the cooking -rrb- and the register . <sssss> once they know you , it feels like you are part of the family ! 
5		i have gone to this nail salon many times . <sssss> it is very clean which is a number 1 priority . <sssss> they use separate plastic shields in each foot bath as they did today . <sssss> they have nice massage chairs and lots of magazines . <sssss> every thing is clean that they use on you and the place it self is clean and pleasant . <sssss> they take walk ins and also do waxing . <sssss> i did not get a wax today but , have many times in the past . <sssss> always clean and no after problems . <sssss> they take cash and credit . <sssss> plus they follow direction well . <sssss> some salons do not ! <sssss> the prices are not bad , there are cheaper places but , they are not as clean . <sssss> lots of parking . 
5		another year , another devoured ! <sssss> what a great event ! <sssss> still located at the phoenix art museum sculptural garden , and they even expanded this year to include two additional rooms indoors . <sssss> the out-of-state wines were available for purchase , in addition to some sports and music memorabilia for auction -lrb- which seemed , out of place to me at a food event -rrb- . <sssss> cocktails , entrees , appetizers , desserts , oh my . <sssss> my husband and i even tried to split each portion so as not to get too full . <sssss> well , that only lasted so long . <sssss> we were so pleased to see multiple fish dishes and beautiful salads available as we do n't eat meat . <sssss> green restaurant is always a favorite and they showcased a mock-bbq chicken with coleslaw salad . <sssss> the cedar-planked salmon from switch ? <sssss> i think , was also amazing . <sssss> my favorite cocktails of the day were a fabulous dessert port from su vino winery , and a pineapple/tequila shot from ... i have no idea because i had two of them . <sssss> there seemed to be plenty of water this year , i remember last year the bottled water ran out as it was a really hot day . <sssss> there was also more seating this year , which was nice , so you could sit and digest a little . <sssss> terrific event !!!!! 
5		over a year later and still great . <sssss> went in on a sunday afternoon for a late lunch and got the california burger -lrb- sans tomatoes and pickles -rrb- . <sssss> the avocado was fresh , the bun was n't dry , and their `` secret '' sauce was still perfectly peppery and went great with the avocado and cheese . <sssss> it 's also one of the only places to get a lot of the soda they have on offer and today i chose a vanilla root beer from barrel brothers . <sssss> it seems that they bought most of the mini-mall they 're in so there 's more parking and will soon be a lot more seating . <sssss> good for them ! 
5		very good asian food . <sssss> the ingredients are very fresh and flavorful . <sssss> i loved the shrimp in lobster sauce -lrb- hard to find anymore -rrb- and the moo shoo pork as well as the hot and sour soup . <sssss> i try to go there once a week . <sssss> love the shrimp fried rice as well . 
5		i have been to st. francis about 5 times now and every time i am completely satisfied with everything from the ambiance , to the service , to the amazing food . <sssss> i want to touch on just one menu item , the eggs benedict . <sssss> i have n't been able to eat said food for about 5 years now after a horrible food poisoning experience in mexico brought on by bad hollandaise . <sssss> it is my fiance 's favorite breakfast food and every time he orders it i try it and every time i can barely choke it down . <sssss> not the case here ! <sssss> i tried it , i loved it , i wish i ordered it myself ! <sssss> i ate not only a bite or two of his , but our dining companion as well . <sssss> just thinking about it right now makes my mouth water . <sssss> in a good way . 
5		i 've taken my vehicles to kelly automotive for over a year now and could n't be happier . <sssss> these guys know what they are doing and have even been able to take care of my more `` creative '' auto issues . <sssss> most important , they are honest so you feel that you paid a fair price for the exact work done . <sssss> they are n't the cheapest -lrb- which is good -rrb- and they are n't the most expensive . <sssss> highly recommend kelly and his group . 
5		best class ever ! <sssss> i love okello 's teaching style : fun , hands on , good use of powerpoint , and sarcasm !!! <sssss> :-rrb- i enjoyed part 1 & 2 . <sssss> ready for light room 4 next ! <sssss> highly recommended . 
5		big ups to the vig . <sssss> sometimes you stumble on a restaurant so good you wish it was in your own neighborhood . <sssss> i want to give this restaurant a warm deep kiss -- it excels at everything . <sssss> the decor : mid century modern . <sssss> cool and inviting . <sssss> the waitstaff : attentive in every manner . <sssss> we ordered the chickpea and pita bread for the table and our waitress refilled the plate three times ! <sssss> the food : the absolute bomb in comfort food . <sssss> i could live on the spicy chicken wings : the best i have tasted . <sssss> the cobb salad is perfectly balanced . <sssss> the pad thai : a complex flavor bomb of asian tastes . 
5		very nice place . <sssss> the burger i had was amazingly good . <sssss> the place was very busy and the service was good . 
5		i was getting married in 3 days and realized that i had totally forgotten to schedule a wax ... ahhhhh ! <sssss> i started searching online and calling people , i left a message for jessica and she called back and was able to work me in that day . <sssss> god bless this woman ! <sssss> i was a stressed out bride and she calmed me down and made the wax a quick and painless experience . <sssss> she is my go to person for waxing . <sssss> i highly recommend jessica . <sssss> she is awesome ! 
5		the gilbert house restaurant categories : breakfast & brunch , american -lrb- traditional -rrb- 5.0 star rating 2/4/2013 two of us arrived and dined at the gilbert house today -lrb- approximately 11:15 am -rrb- for breakfast and both of us agree that it was exceptional in terms of both atmosphere and quality of the food . <sssss> we order breakfast that was way too much food , i believe , for one person ; however , i am a moderate eater . <sssss> my company cleaned their plate but thought the serving size was large as well . <sssss> this is decent serving size for the money and the quality was outstanding , indeed ! <sssss> in terms of quality , i ordered the green chili omelet with a side order of center cut , perfectly cooked , bacon , wheat toast , coffee and hash browns too , and i could not finish the entire plate . <sssss> my company ordered two eggs -lrb- over easy -rrb- , hash browns and coffee plus he found the meal to be appetizing , large and perfectly cooked . <sssss> we will both be back and hopefully tell many others about the quality and portion of foods offered for breakfast . <sssss> secondly , we interacted with the staff and owner who were charming and made our visit equally , dynamic , friendly and joyful ! <sssss> we were greeted by our server nicely , promptly and offered seating options and delighted with the conversations we were engaged with by both the owner and staff . <sssss> the restaurant was just about full ; however , we never felt rushed , and spent nearly an hour eating our meals while engaging the owner and staff in delightful , amusing conversations . <sssss> at the completion of our meals and upon exiting the parking lot , my friend stated to me , `` that was about the most perfect breakfast meal we have enjoyed in this area '' . <sssss> i thought to myself that this will be one place that i am sure we will return to in the near future many , many , times . <sssss> i have already invited to other people to join me for breakfast there after sunday services next week . <sssss> this is a wonderful place where detail is put into the experience for the customer . <sssss> i can not , at this point , find any circumstance that causes me pause with respect to returning to this truly wonderful venue . <sssss> both the staff and the food were at an all time high and i can not wait for another exceptionally great experience when i return for breakfast again , and soon 
5		cute store , great selection , friendly staff , reasonable pricing . <sssss> this is probally the best scrapbook store in arizona . <sssss> i have to say the scrap booking convention was an awesome experience . <sssss> paper vineyard has the next best closest selection to the scrap book convention ... thank you for the 20 for 30 deal , can honestly say i got alot of goodies for my money . <sssss> :-rrb- if you are into scrap booking i highly recomend checking this place out . 
5		our experience with flooring america of chandler was nothing short of five stars . <sssss> dale and his team were attentive , knowledgable , and patient through our entire project . <sssss> we replaced almost all of the flooring in our 2900 square foot home . <sssss> this was a big project and i am so glad we trusted it to flooring america of chandler . <sssss> the staff in the showroom took the time to help me find the perfect tile and they worked hard to make sure it was available to be installed on exactly the days i needed . <sssss> dale gave great advice at each step and the installation team was professional , trustworthy , and extremely hard working . <sssss> together they turned around our entire house in less than a week -- though we expected the project to take much , much longer . <sssss> dale even went out of his way to order replacement molding for our wood floors , even though this was not part of the original project . <sssss> we are very happy with our new floors and highly recommend dale and his team at flooring america of chandler . 
5		this fry 's is nothing short of amazing . <sssss> as other reviewers have mentioned , it is both upscale and massive . <sssss> there are many different prepared food themed stations , such as a juice bar , a sushi bar and a wine bar . <sssss> there is a walk-in refrigerated wine area and a studio kitchen that holds cooking demos . <sssss> the produce section even had a jackfruit for sale , although it was priced at $ 100 , so i 'm sure it was more for display than anything else . <sssss> the best thing about this fry 's , though , is that it helps you to avoid making multiple grocery store trips in a single day - i 've wasted too many hours doing the trader joe 's / fresh & easy , safeway , whole foods trifecta just to find all of the groceries i need for the week . <sssss> this place has the prepared foods and specialty selection of whole foods , the staples of a normal fry 's or safeway , and although it 's not as cheap as tj 's or f&e , it at least does n't burn a hole in your wallet like aj 's or whole foods . <sssss> come and check it out for yourself - it 's quite an experience ! 
5		the best ever . 
5		amazing . <sssss> the food is eclectic . <sssss> the restaurant claims to be a steakhouse but they serve much , much more . <sssss> try anything from the `` raw '' menu , you wo n't be disappointed . <sssss> if possible ask for chip , he is attentive and very knowledgeable when it comes to the menu . <sssss> we had so many questions about the items and he was very helpful making suggestion and recommendations . <sssss> very pleased with our visit ! <sssss> will definitely be back . 
5		chompies has the best bagels in az. . <sssss> period . <sssss> most places under cook their bagels , and they are too doughy - like einstein 's . <sssss> chompies bagels are unmatched and very tasty , along with their cream cheese , which comes in a ton of different flavor options . 
5		the junk guys were awesome . <sssss> i had a home remodel to complete in two weeks - this included demolition of a kitchen and two bathrooms . <sssss> i initially was going to get a dumpster and have it picked up a week later . <sssss> after doing some research , it was much less expensive to use the junk guys . <sssss> i liked that they were a locally based company , and i really enjoyed that i did n't have to have a dumpster parked in front of the house for a week , nor did i have to load it myself ! <sssss> after two separate trips -lrb- kitchen cabinets , old counters , sheet vinyl , remnants of two gutted bathrooms -rrb- , the cost was still well below what other companies were charging for a small dumpster or one load hauled away . <sssss> they were professional , personable , and punctual . <sssss> highly recommended ! 
5		we happened upon this location when meeting a friend for dinner . <sssss> when i showed up there was a line of about 20 people ahead of me . <sssss> i asked them to put me in first available and they said 15-20min and then 45min for a booth . <sssss> ok , i 'll wait . <sssss> our friends showed up and my girlfriend had asked if there was a spot at the bar we could sit in the mean time . <sssss> we were there for about 10min already . <sssss> that 's when she said to us . <sssss> `` your table inside is ready '' she walked us right there and we were sat . <sssss> wow ! <sssss> that was quick ! <sssss> we ordered drinks and food . <sssss> i got these jerk chicken wings for an appetizer and holy cow , they were delicious . <sssss> for my main dish i ordered a garlic noodle dish . <sssss> it definitely hit the spot . <sssss> my only beef would be that it was hard to talk with so many people inside . <sssss> i wont let that affect the rating though . <sssss> awesome place ! 
5		5-star service . <sssss> lovely property ; immaculately-maintained in every respect ; prompt , friendly , efficient services from our valet-assisted arrival through check-out . <sssss> we both felt very comfortable and will return again the next time we are going to scottsdale . <sssss> i would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys being pampered that they stay here . 
5		this place is super awesome ! <sssss> this place is also super chaotic because the prices are great and the selection is good so it draws a lot of customers . <sssss> you bump carts almost every 5 to 10 feet , aisles are always full , sometimes you have to wait to pass - unless you used to cocktail waitress and you know how to get through the crowd . <sssss> haha . <sssss> not really conveniently located but well worth the drive . <sssss> if you want to can some produce , have company coming , a big dinner , or something else that requires a bulk purchase , this is the place to hit . <sssss> love it and wish i had come here a long time ago . <sssss> oh yeah , good size parking lot to accomodate all of those customers . 
5		yum !! <sssss> we meant to go to posidon , but seeing that posidon was closed for no apparent reason , we headed up the street to george 's instead . <sssss> it looked like a crummy gyro fast food place from the outside -lrb- and inside to be honest -rrb- . <sssss> the menu had all the greek must haves but nothing too crazy . <sssss> after ordering a chicken pita with salad , i discovered that they did n't need to extra frills to prove how great they are . <sssss> the chicken was cooked perfect , pita was soft and delicious , and the salad was exactly what i had been craving with it 's balance of dressing , feta cheese , onions , and greek olives . <sssss> the boyfriend also nom-ed every last piece of his pork pita with tzatziki sauce on the side . <sssss> i give george 's five stars because their food blows other chain and better known greek places out of the water - but they are n't gimmicky or over done . <sssss> it 's rather unfortunate that it 's in a part of mesa that might not be bringing in all the business it deserves . <sssss> i 'd like to relocate this place next to asu , really . <sssss> next time i want to try the hummus and dolmades . <sssss> . <sssss> mm . 
5		amazing ! <sssss> amazing amazing amazing ! <sssss> i came for my birthday with twelve people , we feasted like royalty on 15 different dishes , brought our own booze , had an amazing time all for under $ 200 bucks . <sssss> the service was exceptional and the lok lak and fish amok was better than any i ever had in cambodia . <sssss> go eat at this restaurant ! <sssss> now ! 
5		wow ! <sssss> i could probably justify this review with just simple `` wow '' and be done with it . <sssss> but i am not a woman of few words so i 'll elaborate . <sssss> i went here on friday night with 3 of my friends , one of whom is in a wheelchair . <sssss> if you do n't know where to find the door you will walk right past it . <sssss> it truly has that old speakeasy feel of yesteryear . <sssss> once you walk is that feeling continues with the low lighting , comfy couches , and set up in general . <sssss> yes there were christmas decorations up , but it 's christmas in july . <sssss> no big deal . <sssss> we were promptly seated upfront where the band was setting up . <sssss> the wait staff were extremely accommodating to my friend making sure people were out of his way and getting him situated into his place at the table . <sssss> at this point , my only complaint was that it was hard to see the menus . <sssss> but that 's what we have flashlight apps for right ? <sssss> the wine list is in a binder with many options to choose from . <sssss> our waitress was very knowledgeable and after we ordered out first glass from the menu we decided just to tell her what we were in the mood for and she would suggest a wine , bring it , and it was fantastic . <sssss> for food we started with the antipasto plate which is served with bread . <sssss> the cheeses were smooth and buttery . <sssss> prosciutto was perfect along with the serrano ham . <sssss> i ca n't speak for the olives as i hate olives but my friends say they were good . <sssss> next we ordered one of the chef 's specialties for the night . <sssss> it was a curry , garlic , duck confit , creme fraiche dip served with homemade potato chips . <sssss> this dip was amazing . <sssss> i wanted to spead it on everything . <sssss> between the four of us we darn near licked the bowl clean . <sssss> finally we ordered the three cheese fondue with apples and toasted baguette . <sssss> again you almost had to hold me back from licking the pot clean . <sssss> the combination of cheeses with apple and bread was heaven . <sssss> the live band they had was also very good that night . <sssss> good mix of music . <sssss> the cover is 5 $ which originally i scoffed at , but after spending four hours with great friends , music , amazing food , and a spectacular ambiance it was totally worth it . <sssss> i will be back and soon . 
5		this is the kind of place that i 'm like , seriously - why did i not think of this ? <sssss> in college , i had a full blown nacho addiction . <sssss> i corrupted the majority of my girlfriends to the same fate , guiding them to 7-11 and showing them my systematic way of keeping the chips separate while nearly bankrupting the fake cheese sauce machine into the container with the jalapeno slices . <sssss> but this was only the gateway drug , soon i moved on to the various ` bertos and super burritos of the valley eager for more more ! <sssss> it 's been a minute since then , but when i discovered this new nacho-only spot downtown last first friday - i was like my old college self , leading my troop from our beers at the roosevelt down a few blocks to the promise land : nachobot . <sssss> true to downtown style , it is located in a cozy old house with about one big table inside . <sssss> there was exactly 1 cool dude that was working as the order taker , cashier , and the magical nacho maker . <sssss> i think i should call him mr. bot . <sssss> my bf kind of gave me a look when i suggested we each order our own -lrb- he likes to share -rrb- so mr. bot suggested we do a lil ' half and half compromise . <sssss> i had the side with the roasted garlic , caramelized mushrooms , and cheese -lrb- omg -rrb- , and he had the side with the slow cooked colorado beef with a spicy red sauce and yes , more cheese . <sssss> there were chopsticks to eat with , but that would have just slowed me down and prevented me from licking my fingers of all the cheese sauce goodness that was nachobot . <sssss> i really appreciated that the cheese was not just the pre-shredded variety haphazardly thrown on there and expected to melt with the addition of other toppings -lrb- ` bertos i 'm talking to you -rrb- , nor was it that machine orange cheese sauce -lrb- how my standards have improved since college , in all ways -rrb- . <sssss> the bot cheese is a delicious sauce concoction that is made from scratch so it stays gooey and melty , and is layered and weaved into every last tortilla chip along with the toppings so that it feels like that first top bite right until the very end . <sssss> shockingly , we took some leftovers home . <sssss> i actually heated them up and ate them in the morning . <sssss> i did not share -lrb- it was like 4 chips ! -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> after announcing that i was making my famous sausage biscuits and gravy for breakfast my bf asks what happened to that leftover nachobot ? <sssss> and then his pouty face came out . <sssss> he actually tried to go back the next day for lunch while retrieving his car from downtown . <sssss> they are n't open for lunch , but they are open until 4:00 am , which is just how it should be . <sssss> see you soon mr. bot ! 
5		awesome place awesome service !!! <sssss> love this one of its kind place in the country ... a must visit of you go to phoenix area 
5		this was my first time trying pho , and i was hooked . <sssss> after trying from a few other places since , i have to say i may not have become a fan had i not had the first three pho meals from here . <sssss> awesome food , prices and service . 
5		the wings are actually hot and the cheese pizza is good and frankly if a place cant make a cheese pizza than it cant make pizza 
5		i live in la where these shops are on every corner . <sssss> i can say without a doubt , this is the best froyo i 've had ! <sssss> on top of that , the store staff is super-friendly and the place is immaculately clean . <sssss> they are also serving gelato , pastries and fresh coffee/espresso . <sssss> check it out ! 
5		enjoy getting the special deal they have on mondays or tuesdays where you can buy one pizza and get the second half off . <sssss> their pizzas are cooked just right and the crust is n't too thick or too thin . <sssss> also , their pizza is even enjoyable later on when you nuke it in the microwave . <sssss> the staff was friendly and made sure everything was ok just enough and they were not annoying at all . 
5		amazing ! <sssss> if you like sweet , want organic products and the best ~ look no more ! 
5		the list of tuck shop awesomeness keeps growing . <sssss> three words : `` ginger ale '' and `` dessert . '' <sssss> each are worth every calorie ! <sssss> i had always skipped dessert here because the novel cookie dough bite was enough to satisfy ; but , then , i had a bite of someone 's cake here and it was fantastic ! <sssss> so fantastic , the memory of it compelled me to encourage a dinner companion to pass on dessert at a northeast scottsdale -lrb- we 're talking practically fountain hills -rrb- restaurant and make the trek to tuck shop just for dessert ! <sssss> unfortunately , it was a monday and they were closed so i had to go with an alternate . <sssss> point remains : the dessert inspired the drive . <sssss> keep sharing your food and save room for dessert ! 
5		95 reviews ? <sssss> guess there 's nothing i can say about this gem that has n't been said . <sssss> we ordered the cheese pizza which is a really inexpensive but delicious tasting margarita pizza sooo good . <sssss> we also had the vodka penne with tender big pieces of rendered bacon , tomatoes and fresh basil . <sssss> the vodka sauce was creamy and seasoned very well . <sssss> they included a ton of grilled french bread and cutlery because they knew i was staying at a hotel . <sssss> they were really sweet and very fast at getting all that food ready for us . <sssss> it says on their website and on the yelp search engine that pizza a metro delivers but they do n't . <sssss> not a big deal though the food is totally worth going to get yourself . 
5		the best ! <sssss> not only is the food delicious but the family that owns and operates this business are as kind , courteous , and caring as it gets ! <sssss> good food and loving on people is their thing . 
5		the mural above the starbucks of many famous authors is simply amazing . <sssss> the authors depicted are all seated together and discussing . <sssss> an inspiring sight . 
5		my client took me there yesterday , its one of his favorite spots . <sssss> i wish i had listened to him earlier . <sssss> i had a salad with blue cheese and mini grilled cheese -lrb- blue cheese and havarti on just right crisp sour dough -rrb- . <sssss> both were outstanding . <sssss> my client had the roast beef and blue cheese sandwich . <sssss> it was piled high with beef . <sssss> he gave me a sample and it was also terrific . <sssss> i 'm taking my son there today to try something new . <sssss> no more taking my lunch with me to my client 's . <sssss> glad i go to his place every week so i can lunch at bertha 's ! 
5		really great ! <sssss> extremely nice staff !! <sssss> amazing hours ! <sssss> loved the chai tea w / espresso -lrb- great flavor , not sweet ! -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> made to order sandwich -lrb- mine : tuna fish , egg , tomato , avocado , spinach , provolone , on wheat = so good ! -rrb- <sssss> . <sssss> free wifi -lrb- was n't slow like some places ! -rrb- <sssss> i liked the music videos . <sssss> desserts look great -lrb- going to get a chocolate chip cookie soon ! -rrb- <sssss> 2 big couches , 8 tables , plenty of electrical plugs , + outdoor seating out back ! <sssss> if they get busy , they really have plenty of space to bring in a few more tables . <sssss> it is really easy to miss this place when driving by ; it is in the middle of a little strip of stores . <sssss> front parking is very limited , but there is a big side parking lot . <sssss> ~ enjoy ! 
5		these guys know a thing or two about making stellar sandwiches . <sssss> this is a local , family owned establishment and they 've already served up over a million sandwiches . <sssss> i would eat here more often , but their hours are limited . <sssss> first thing for a superb sandwich is bread . <sssss> bread is key , and their sourdough is soft perfection . <sssss> second is meat , and they use top quality boar 's head meat . <sssss> i 've also ordered half-sized sandwiches , which is also a plus . <sssss> they carry a number of special items in addition to standard fare , such as poore brothers chips , specialty sodas , and swedish goodies . 
5		this is our regular thai place . <sssss> love the curry and the staff . <sssss> when they know it is for you when you call it in , you know you eat there too often . <sssss> i have tried several other thai restaurants , but i keep coming back to this one . 
5		the wine list is great , the bruschetta are delicious , and the desserts are ... well i never order dessert but i could n't resist . <sssss> i ca n't wait to go back . 
5		i love these guys ! <sssss> eat there ! <sssss> and often ! 
5		thanks to you , capriotti 's , my boyfriend and i can finally go out for sub sandwiches together . <sssss> my boyfriend has been a regular at capriotti 's -lrb- both here and vegas -rrb- for years . <sssss> as a vegetarian , i have a pretty strict `` no sandwich chains '' dining rule . <sssss> i do not want sliced tomatoes , iceberg lettuce , and mustard on bread for a meal . <sssss> on his last capriotti 's visit , my boyfriend informed me of the vegetarian-friendly menu . <sssss> i looked it up online , could n't wait to try it . <sssss> inside , the tempe location is more of a cute deli than a subway . <sssss> the staff was very nice and helpful and the sandwiches were served quickly -lrb- the establishment was not busy at the time though -rrb- . <sssss> my boyfriend got the turkey sub -lrb- his usual -rrb- and i got the vegetarian version . <sssss> on my sub , i got faux turkey , cheese , lettuce , tomato , onion -lrb- which are so thinly sliced and amazing -rrb- , pickles , sweet peppers -lrb- also amazing -rrb- and mustard . <sssss> i would recommend this combination to any vegetarian looking for a filling and tasty cold sub sandwich . <sssss> i noticed some people on here complaining about the pricing . <sssss> well , the ingredients here are of a much higher quality and fresher than a subway or quizno 's , so in my opinion , it is worth paying a couple extra dollars . <sssss> my boyfriend loves it because they use shredded turkey instead of deli slices on the subs . <sssss> i am not sure if i will be able to wait many meals before running over there to try the vegetarian version of the bobby . 
5		the atmosphere here is tremendous . <sssss> you feel at home as soon as you walk through the doors and are welcomed by friendly people who actually know something about coffee . <sssss> the coffee ? <sssss> excellent . <sssss> keep in mind , this is not a starbucks . <sssss> be ready to wait a few minutes for your caffeinated beverage but it 's worth the wait . <sssss> i have n't tried and of the food yet but there was a quiche brought to a table nearby that looked delicious . <sssss> i strongly suggest sitting on the patio while you have your coffee . <sssss> there 's lots of comfortable seating . <sssss> overall , this place is my new go to when i want a good cup of coffee . <sssss> you should try it too . 
5		hands down the best donuts in the valley ! <sssss> well worth the trek south . <sssss> my co-workers turn into schoolgirls when i bring them in . <sssss> get there early or you 'll miss out ... 
5		in a former life , i managed a fine dining victorian restaurant in pittsburgh . <sssss> we had the occasional high tea -lrb- this is actually the common tea for dinner , afternoon tea is the more formal -rrb- request and let me tell you , it is labor intensive ! <sssss> if you cut off the crusts of the bread too early , they will get crusty , unless you dampen cheesecloth and place it over them . <sssss> the phoenician is knowledgeable about the whole enchilada and wanda is the queen of the tea . <sssss> if you have the fortune to have her take care of you , you are in good hands . 
5		there is a reason i always come here . <sssss> the food is always good , the portions are better than any other thai place i 've been to . <sssss> i never pay more than $ 10 . <sssss> whoever rates this place less than 4 stars is just being an asshole . 
5		a brand new place we discovered . <sssss> the decor seemed industrial chic , yet warm and comfortable . <sssss> we ordered a few different pizzas and shared . <sssss> i could n't pick a favorite they were all so good ! <sssss> but the very best part was the beer . <sssss> i tried a few samples before choosing their pale ale with dinner and their brown for desert , some of the best local beer i 've ever had ! 
5		outstanding the butternut squash ravioli and grouper , clams and scallops simply the best meal we have had in quite awhile !!!! 
5		this place is great ... i was skeptical at first , because i thought `` microwavable '' would suck ! <sssss> however i gave the place a chance & i 've been eating these great already portioned tasty meals for the past 2 weeks . <sssss> . <sssss> the food has alot of flavour & i 'm so surprised it still tastes so good in the microwave . <sssss> . <sssss> this is perfect for bachelors , people on the go , or trying to manage their weight . <sssss> service is excellent as well . <sssss> love the concept ! 
5		apple , saks 5th avenue , macy 's , ralph lauren , cole hann , all reside in the best shopping destination in phoenix ! 
5		there are not enough good words to describe these guys . <sssss> here was my experience : 11:00 friday night - realize upstairs a/c is out -lrb- of course where all bedrooms are . <sssss> get up saturday and begin researching a/c companies . <sssss> being somewhat new to az and not having had to call for a/c service before , i asked friends , coworkers , etc , and checked out yelp . <sssss> based on so many positive reviews , i called flores , and now have to add my positive review to the rest ! <sssss> 9:30 sat morn - call and speak with miguel , who takes all of my information and tells me that he should be able to get someone out to me , and will have the tech call me 10:00 sat morn - call from michael that he will be at my house within 35 minutes 10:30 sat morn - michael arrives 11:45 sat morn - diagnosis of a capacitor problem . <sssss> waiting for the big expense to come ... and he tells me it is an $ 80 part , and would be under warranty . <sssss> including their trip/labor fee , it was well under $ 200 when all was said and done . <sssss> michael also checked my second unit , checked the attic vents , and gave me some good advice about the filters and the optimum temps for the units to run at during our hot days . <sssss> talk about a relief , all the way around ! <sssss> i have previously dealt with a/c companies that obviously and visibly did not care about what they were doing , that did n't appreciate a dilemma like a unit out on a friday night when you have kids in the house , and that way overcharged for their services based on the general ignorance of most of us about what costs should be for this type of specialty work . <sssss> i will always call flores from here on out , and i will recommend them to everyone i can ! 
5		i 've read some negative reviews about this hotel and have to admit it made me nervous . <sssss> from the second i arrived at the hotel the staff have been exceptional . <sssss> the casita that we are staying in is far beyond what we had expected for the money . <sssss> we had a fantastic dinner and drinks in the restaurant and enjoyed a soak in the hot tub in peace and quiet . <sssss> there are many pools to choose from , its easy to fund one thats suits your mood . <sssss> the resort is top caliber as far as i can see . <sssss> day 1 and i can not find anything to complain about . <sssss> i travel a lot and this has ranked as one of the best accommodations so far . <sssss> if it stays likes this for the next 4 days , we will come back every year . <sssss> very pleased . <sssss> special thanks to the front desk manager and concierge . <sssss> they are great ! 
5		the food and service was awesome !!! <sssss> our waitress was desiree . <sssss> being our first time here , we took her recommendations . <sssss> excellent choices . <sssss> the hummus was smooth , creamy , and flavored just right . <sssss> best ever ! <sssss> the bread is homemade and perfect alone or with the hummus . <sssss> the dana sis -lrb- grilled lamb cubes , rice , and vegetables -rrb- was something i 'd recommend . <sssss> the lamb cubes were generously sized , seasoned and grill perfectly . <sssss> moist and packed with flavor ... not gamey . <sssss> went perfectly with the seasoned rice and shredded veggies . <sssss> portion was large enough for two . <sssss> they have several deserts . <sssss> we got the baklava . <sssss> they had several kinds . <sssss> we got two of the four choices . <sssss> definitely made with butter and so good . <sssss> not overly sweet . <sssss> went perfect with their turkish tea . <sssss> every dish seemed to have a secret ingredient . <sssss> . <sssss> i know because i asked . <sssss> the service was timely , friendly , and educational . <sssss> it was an excellent first time experience . <sssss> never been to turkey , but i know i 'll love the food and people . <sssss> price was reasonable . <sssss> with the food portions so large and delicious i do n't know how all the staff stay so slim . 
5		what a find ! <sssss> the first time i walked into the place i saw handmade clothes , jewelry , pottery , shoulder bags & coffee . <sssss> the back section had health and beauty creations from soaps to hair care products all locally made . <sssss> the coffee is great and i like the hummus and flax seed crackers since i 'm gluten intolerant . <sssss> usually i go into the library and browse the internet and read some of the zines people have written like , `` jail stories . '' <sssss> this place is such a good spot that i bring everyone from out of town to it . <sssss> one person described conspire as an artist collective akin to those found in seattle or portland . <sssss> da bomb for shiz . 
5		had a fish taco , pastor taco & rolled chicken taco . <sssss> all incredibly tender , juicy & tasty . <sssss> eating here was the best decision we made during our short stay in phoenix ! 
5		i 'm not a big chain restaurant type of gal , but this place is top notch not only in service , but as well as quality of food . <sssss> the fillet mijon was tasty , perfectly cooked -lrb- medium -rrb- , and still sizzling hot on my plate . <sssss> we ordered mac and cheese , potatoes au gratin , and the asparagus for sides . <sssss> again , i can not express the 5 star quality of food this place serves . <sssss> to end our evening off , we ordered the chocolate lava cake . <sssss> i 'm do n't have a sweet tooth whatsoever , but to see the hot chocolate oozing out of the middle of the cake with vanilla bean ice cream . <sssss> wow , my taste buds were in heaven . <sssss> i will be coming back to this place sooner rather than later . <sssss> get the lava cake ready for me ! <sssss> this time i will make room to fit it all in my tummy . 
5		came here a couple times after my last review and the experiences were great ! <sssss> i finally got a chance to try the food and the burger was amazing ! <sssss> i also tried my friends pizza and it was also very good . <sssss> the service was fast and the staff was very kind and helpful . <sssss> we just had to push the red button and someone came right away . <sssss> i love it ! <sssss> definitely recommend a try ! <sssss> just do n't drink too much lol ! 
5		this is the best place to get authentic mexican style street tacos . <sssss> the tacos al pastor are amazing . <sssss> there are many other restaurants in the valley that are nicer and have good mexican food . <sssss> there is no place that has a better street taco . <sssss> totally worth sitting outside when it is 100 + degrees . 
5		i had a great great experience buying a certain special piece of jewelry -lrb- shh do n't tell her ! -rrb- <sssss> unlike other shops , i felt at home and welcome at burland . <sssss> there was no pressure . <sssss> they carried a very diverse and beautiful selection of jewelry that could fit any budget . <sssss> i was afraid that my small budget could n't get me much , but i immediately saw that i could get a lot for my small budget ! <sssss> helen and marc were wonderful salespeople . <sssss> they were sincerely excited to help me . <sssss> they patiently answered all my numerous questions . <sssss> once again , there was no pressure . <sssss> they even ordered a few rings in the style i was looking for to have a greater selection . <sssss> they told me they would call me in a week when they came in . <sssss> coming back for the second visit , i picked out the ring i wanted . <sssss> 24 hours later , a beautiful ring was in my possession . <sssss> for the first time in a long time , i 've had no buyers remorse at all . <sssss> let 's just hope the love of my life will have it ! 
5		love this place ! <sssss> always friendly and they always greet you with a smile , even with my sometimes complex orders . <sssss> so many choices and combinations . <sssss> my niece 's favorite is mango smoothie with popping mango boba , fresh mango and regular boba . <sssss> the best thing after dim sum at mekong palace . 
5		clean , great food , and a great family restaurant . <sssss> i like to go as an adult , but i can take my niece and nephew for a day as well . 
5		two reviews in one here ... first , the restaurant is great , the staff is friendly and the food is excellent . <sssss> on my first visit , i had the chicken limone . <sssss> absolutely delicious . <sssss> that meal made sure i 'd be back . <sssss> fast forward about 7 months and i am home on extended sick leave but trying to plan our wedding reception . <sssss> having canceled our wedding plans once due to illness , then eloping , my fiance and i knew there was no way we could cancel the reception too . <sssss> so ... i am at home on the computer trying to figure out where we could get food . <sssss> and jimmy 's came up in a search . <sssss> checked out their catering menu online -lrb- thank you so much for having online menus ! -rrb- <sssss> and seeing how reasonable the prices are , my husband and i arranged to meet a friend at jimmy 's to try some options . <sssss> we chose to try : -- cavatelli with vodka sauce -- sausage with peppers and potatoes -- eggplant parmigiana the cavatelli was eyes-rolling-back-in-your-head delicious . <sssss> i had chosen this to try because i originally wanted gnocchi but that was n't offered on the catering menu . <sssss> so i picked this as a possible substitute and it was amazing ! <sssss> i was willing to fight my husband and our friend to eat all the cavatelli we were sampling . <sssss> my husband 's pick was the sausage , peppers and potatoes . <sssss> he is definitely a meat and potatoes kind of guy and this entree fit the bill . <sssss> the sausage was mildly seasoned , the peppers and potatoes were cooked just right . <sssss> yum ! <sssss> we chose the eggplant parmigiana for a more traditional italian dish and i 'm so glad we did . <sssss> no bitterness to the eggplant , the tomato sauce was excellent and how can you go wrong with mozzarella cheese all over it ? <sssss> we ended up ordering all three for our reception . <sssss> the cost of the trays included racks to put them on , sterno to keep the food hot and serving utensils . <sssss> for less than $ 250 , we had enough food to serve about 40 people . <sssss> what a value ! <sssss> when my husband went to pick the food up the day of the reception , it was all ready and waiting for him , in fact he said the staff was right there with it so quickly . <sssss> one of my worst fears was that he 'd have to wait for it and we were on a tight time line to have him pick up the food , the cake , the keg , etc. . <sssss> our guests loved the food . <sssss> the star of the night was definitely the cavatelli but everything was just wonderful . <sssss> i was even glad that we had a few no-shows for the reception because we had leftovers to enjoy for a few days afterward . <sssss> this has proven to me that i could eat jimmy 's food every day of the week and still want more . <sssss> thank you so much , jimmy 's ! 
5		unlimited steak ! <sssss> yes this place is a dream come true , although it is an expensive dream , it is worth every penny . <sssss> if your going to buckle down and spend a few bucks , i would highly recommend fogo de chao . <sssss> once you are seated , there is no wait , the food comes immediately . <sssss> filet mignon , parmesan pork , top or bottom sirloin -lrb- yes there is a bottom sirloin -rrb- , rib eye , etc. . <sssss> they bring you steak until you ca n't eat anymore . <sssss> they also bring you unlimited mash potatoes , cheesy bread , and fried bananas . <sssss> not only is the food top notch , the service is a well . <sssss> i do n't think i 've ever been there and had a rude or incompetent server . <sssss> i do n't think i 've ever left with out a bulging belly , and a food coma ! 
5		i adore this place , i 'm a big fan ! <sssss> i have been here 3 times and i have only known about it 3 months ! <sssss> this place is classy and clean ! <sssss> the first time i was there me and my fiancee sat at the bar -lrb- which was a gorgeous well stocked bar -rrb- we had lunch we both got chicken sandwiches omg delicious ! <sssss> they have the best desert ! <sssss> we are big fans of bread pudding so we got the white chocolate bread pudding ! <sssss> omg wow ! <sssss> very good ! <sssss> we were very impressed . <sssss> the cost for that was like $ 30.00 it was quite cheap ! <sssss> we received wonderful service . <sssss> the next time we went was on a friday evening and we were celebrating my new employment . <sssss> they had a date night menu which we decided to order off of . <sssss> the date night menu included appetizers , two salad , two entrees and a desert . <sssss> it also included a drink , or for a little more a bottle of wine . <sssss> we got the spinach artichoke dip , which was good , we got there wcg salad omg so good ! <sssss> i had got the prime rib and my fiancee the rotisserie chicken and ribs ... all of it was delicious ! <sssss> then finally desert we did the white chocolate bread pudding becuase it was so good last time ! <sssss> the price was good we spent $ 58.00 plus tip so it was fairly inexpensive considering all we got . <sssss> again great service and good food ! <sssss> the last time i went i went with my sister . <sssss> she loved it , we got the wcg salad and shared a chicken sandwich all oh so good ! <sssss> this time i switched up the desert . <sssss> we got the white chocolate brownie ! <sssss> oh my it was tasty ! <sssss> i will definitely return ! <sssss> every time i go good food , great service and its a cool and clean place ! 
5		great food , excellent service , this will become a regular of ours ! 
5		wow !! <sssss> the mission is incredible . <sssss> one of the top 5 restaurants in all of phoenix if you ask me . <sssss> they hit on all cylinders , the food is awesome -lrb- try the pork shoulder -rrb- the ambiance is beautiful and inviting , the staff is knowledgable and attractive and the bar has great cocktails . <sssss> wine list could be a little more diverse but all in all one of the best places i 've dined in arizona . <sssss> if you have n't been here you must go . <sssss> great place to have a nice dinner or take a date . 
5		this place is awesome . <sssss> i usually go for the swedish meatballs , with the creamy dill potatoes and their coleslaw , then some green beans . <sssss> oh my goodness ! <sssss> so tasty . <sssss> the coleslaw is sweet and sour style just like my oma makes and i could possibly eat the entire bin . <sssss> the meatballs and tender and juicy and you will likely want more.but you are about to explode from all the food you just ate . <sssss> then your eyes glance over to the baked good section ... those oatmeal cookies ... yes they have oatmeal but its almost like brittle mixed with some sort of crack . <sssss> or their pavalova which is meringue and oranges and pretty much the best thing that your mouth has tasted other than their other food . <sssss> customer service is always great the owner is so sweet ! <sssss> her son is a doll and sells some of his own jewelry creations . <sssss> so check it out you wont complain . <sssss> but just dream of sweden , poland , and even canada because this eclectic mix is not to be missed ! 
5		our experience on new year 's eve was perfect . <sssss> the gentleman who held the door for us upon entering the restaurant was extremely polite and welcoming . <sssss> we later found out he was the general manager . <sssss> he ensured we had a fantastic evening . <sssss> it is easy to see he cares about his guests and his business , and takes pride in what he does . <sssss> both the food and the service kicked off our night the right way . <sssss> thank you . 
5		we stayed in the villas in june , 2008 and plan to return in january 2009 . <sssss> fantastic staff , good food , beautiful property . 
5		lgo . <sssss> . <sssss> lgo . <sssss> . <sssss> l. . <sssss> . <sssss> g. . <sssss> ooooooooo !! <sssss> this place is always amazing . <sssss> the pizza is always great ... amazing burgers and salads as well . <sssss> the grocery store is attached next door and is a great place to pick up your favorite drink , tammie coe cupcake , or small gift . <sssss> also a great breakfast ! <sssss> one of the easiest 5 star reviews . 
5		awesome sushi ! <sssss> best in town ! <sssss> try the spicy tuna roll . 
5		thank goodness for these guys , i found a hurt bunny on the road and took the poor little guy here . <sssss> they were kind to help the bunny not suffer , and did n't ask any money of me . <sssss> they were open when the other places were not , which helped . <sssss> yelp helped me find them when i was sitting outside the other vet hospital up the road that was closed . 
5		awesome thai food . <sssss> one of the best in town . <sssss> and the coconut ice cream and fried plantains was hands-down the best thai dessert i have ever tasted . <sssss> wonderful people too ! 
5		i was n't sure what to expect , but i did not expect that kind of talent to come with warmth & graciousness . <sssss> i was blown away by their voices & their charm :-rrb- & i ca n't say enough about maestro joseph rescigno -lrb- i believe that was his name -rrb- , he was so knowledgeable , passionate , down to earth & entertaining that i could not have asked for anything more , lol . <sssss> in a word , love . 
5		love , love , love , love , love this place . <sssss> coffee in the morning , happy hour , dinner , whatever . <sssss> i have been here several times and each time it does not disappoint . <sssss> leggo to lgo ! 
5		last night was my second time at tryst -lrb- first time for breakfast -rrb- and i have to say that this place is awesome . <sssss> great presentation and great food . <sssss> i got the kalua pork sandwhich , which comes on a brioche bun , and ordered it with a side of sweet potato tots . <sssss> my wife ordered the shrimp tacos , and they were both so tasty . <sssss> we also had 3 other people in our party and their food looked equally amazing . <sssss> will be back , and will be ordering this to-go in the near future ! 
5		gellato is always very enjoyable . <sssss> . <sssss> i recently had the whisky cream . <sssss> it was delicious . <sssss> my favorite item to get here are the canolis . <sssss> the owners are from an area around milan so the items are authentic italian . <sssss> geary place . <sssss> enjoy !!! 
5		i had them come out because some of our outlets were n't working . <sssss> preston came out right away and fixed the issue in about 2 minutes and did n't charge a dime . <sssss> honesty and integrity like that is why they keep getting these high ratings . <sssss> i will definitely use them in the future . 
5		the scavenger hunt was such a great way to start the christmas season and discover new local shops . <sssss> the weather was perfect , there are so many neat places in old town that i never knew existed , i could n't ask for a better day . <sssss> it 's dangerous for me to work up the road from old town , because there several places i want to revisit and do some damage to my wallet . <sssss> baratin is on my list of spots to check out . <sssss> shop local !!!! <sssss> thank you once again lindsey ! 
5		home to one of my favorite dishes of all time ; lobster mashed potatoes at ocean club . <sssss> there are lots of mid-price home decor stores like crate & barrel , z gallerie , and even a few kitchen/cooking stores like sur la table . <sssss> it 's the perfect size to walk around , even when it 's a billion degrees out -lrb- misters !!! -rrb- <sssss> parking is usually decent , too . <sssss> if you do go , do yourself a favor and skip the giant chains like pf changs and cheesecake factory . <sssss> they 're still chains , but try ra -lrb- lunch special or happy hour -rrb- , north , zinc bistro , etc. . 
5		as our week unfolded we realized that we would be kid free for the whole night friday night ! <sssss> let me repeat , the whole night ! <sssss> whoo hoo ! <sssss> with not much time to plan i asked a foodie friend where she suggested we go for dinner . <sssss> she knew my husband has really been into anything french since returning from a recent trip to france so she suggested petite maison . <sssss> i yelped the restaurant and was sold . <sssss> -lrb- thanks reviewers ! -rrb- <sssss> i immediately made reservations . <sssss> on the day i made reservations for friday it was cold and drizzly . <sssss> i asked about heat lamps on the patio and they said they did not have any so i went for an indoor reservation . <sssss> as stated by fellow reviewers , this place has charm oozing from every corner . <sssss> i was disappointed that i had wimped out on outdoor dining because the patio is so inviting with a surrounding garden and a fireplace in the corner . <sssss> but the inside is quite charming itself . <sssss> love the little chandeliers over every table . <sssss> i started with the mussels and my husband ordered the french onion soup . <sssss> the mussels were spectacular . <sssss> they come in a wine broth with a grilled lemon for squeezing . <sssss> a piece of toasted bread is served along side for sopping up the sauce . <sssss> i could have stopped there and been satisfied . <sssss> my husbands soup as cheesy and piping hot . <sssss> it was a little on the sweet side and lacking some needed saltiness but was still delicious . <sssss> for dinner i ordered an item that was new to the menu beginning that night , pork belly served on a butternut squash and bacon hash . <sssss> it was cooked perfectly with a really , really great crust on the bottom and the soft pork fat crunchy and delicious on top . <sssss> i had never had pork belly before and asked our server about it prior to ordering . <sssss> he described perfectly and his suggestion that i try it did not disappoint . <sssss> the sweet butternut squash hash was an excellent compliment . <sssss> my husband ordered the steak frite . <sssss> i have never , ever had a bite of steak better than that . <sssss> it is served with a maitre 'd butter on top that made the experience all the better . <sssss> the frites -lrb- fries -rrb- were golden and spicy served with fantastic mustard sauce for dipping . <sssss> we were so perfectly full and satisfied that we skipped ordering dessert . <sssss> next time , i 'll save room . <sssss> the service was impeccable . <sssss> attentive , educational , perfectly timed . <sssss> and finally , the value was unbelievable . <sssss> we 've spent much more for worse or equal . <sssss> lovely little gem . 
5		i grew up in arizona and always enjoy visiting to enjoy the great restaurants . <sssss> chelsea 's kitchen is now one of my favorite dining spots . <sssss> i recently was in arizona for college graduation and my parents took me to chelsea 's kitchen to celebrate . <sssss> the atmosphere is great and the service was fantastic . <sssss> most importantly the food blew my mind ! <sssss> everything i ate was delicious ! <sssss> i recommend the tacos , -lrb- i personally had the swordfish tacos -rrb- homemade guacamole and make sure to try the ceviche . <sssss> my dad had the burger and he raved about how great it was . <sssss> i was also surprised at how delicious the french fries were . <sssss> i have always been a huge fan of le grande orange , but i think chelsea 's kitchen is 10 times better ! <sssss> i ca n't wait to return to arizona to enjoy this place again ! 
5		loved it . <sssss> service was top-notch and the food was fabulous . <sssss> i ca n't believe i saw negative reviews on here . <sssss> the food is very authentic . <sssss> it 's definitely not for those on a budget . 
5		on christmas eve my car decided it did n't want to start any longer . <sssss> my mom had a good experience and suggested wilhelm auto so i had my car towed over there . <sssss> within hours i got a call from their manager chris asking my approval on a charge to diagnose the car . <sssss> of course i said yes . <sssss> he said he 'd call back in an hour with more info . <sssss> after an hour chris called back with details of what they thought was the issue . <sssss> he very carefully explained everything and gave me a total to fix it . <sssss> the charges were very reasonable even with the diagnoses . <sssss> i gave him my approval and off to work they went on my car . <sssss> i was beyond stressed considering i 'm a single mom with twins boy . <sssss> i was afraid the charges were going to be outrageous . <sssss> they were under $ 400 . <sssss> you can even buy a coupon , which i just did . <sssss> anyone that has had a bad experience here must be hard to please or are purposely posting negative reviews to make this company look bad . <sssss> i will only go to this place of business for car repairs . 
5		holy selection , batman ! <sssss> this place is near full to bursting with anything and everything related to the universe of comic books and superheroes . <sssss> the shelves along the walls of the store are lined with comic books arranged in an almost too perfect manner . <sssss> you can find the newest issues of your favorite comic book here , but for the serious collector -lrb- and i do mean serious -rrb- there is a large assortment of rare and vintage comics from the 70s , 60s and beyond . <sssss> high quality items all wrapped up in protective plastic sleeves . <sssss> in fact , you can buy your own protective plastic sleeves here to protect the comics you have already purchased . <sssss> if you 're a serious collector , consider checking here before you look on ebay . <sssss> an extensive selection of graphic novels , manga and books pertaining to the world of your favorite cartoon hero can all be obtained here . <sssss> action figures ? <sssss> yep . <sssss> quite the selection of your standard superhero action figures and some not so common figures . <sssss> busts , maquettes , statues , ceramic figures and more can be found here as well . <sssss> one of the most extensive selections of comics and action figures i 've yet to encounter in phoenix . <sssss> definitely check it out if you are into comics in the very least . 
5		i have n't been in to this location for some time . <sssss> they have done some remodeling and the employees are very friendly especially a server named susan i think . <sssss> the place was very clean and the food very good . <sssss> i was very impressed and the price was great for all i got . <sssss> i 'll be back ! 
5		you ca n't beat this place for sandwiches . <sssss> # 1 at 12:30 pm on a wednesday it is packed . <sssss> i saw maybe 70 people in the time i waited for my two sandwiches to go . <sssss> prices are $ 4.99 for almost any sandwich you can image and $ 6.50 for huge salads ! <sssss> i waited longer than at other places but everything was so fresh it was n't a problem , i will plan ahead next time . <sssss> tried the vegetarian sandwich with cream cheese , cucumbers , sprouts and avocado on a white sub roll . <sssss> yum !!!! <sssss> so much fresh , ripe avocado . <sssss> my kids shared the turkey sandwich with bacon and avocado on sour dough . <sssss> large drinks are only $ 1.50 and they have two choices for fresh brewed tea . <sssss> they gave my kids a free drink and apologized that they did n't have any free cookies to throw in when our order was ready !!! <sssss> we seriously ca n't wait to go back ! 
5		my parents are from italy and we take them every time they come to az. . <sssss> the food is from their province in italy and they love it ! <sssss> in fact , my parents will not eat at italian restaraunts normally because they are usually disappointed - not here . <sssss> we are going tonight ! 
5		i was closing in a few days on a house and i was in california and needed a repair on the a/c asap so i contacted on time . <sssss> they were fantastic , the customer service was wonderful . <sssss> from the appointment to the technician constantly keeping me informed to the follow up call to let me know the a/c was working and even the final cost was lower than i thought . <sssss> i would easily recommend them ! 
5		hamburger heaven ! <sssss> if you have been searching for the ultimate char-grilled burger , served with hand cut fries and kosher pickles , this is the place . <sssss> not only does this 12 oz . <sssss> `` slice of heaven on a roll '' satisfy the most finicky of hamburger aficionados -lrb- like my boyfriend and i -rrb- they also have the most fabulous dinner menu . <sssss> the atmosphere is rock solid contemporary comfort with hand signed guitars hanging at each booth . <sssss> the music and the food is second to no other ... this is now our favorite place to `` rock out '' anytime we are craving a burger fix , which is at least once a week . <sssss> note : my boyfriend claims that most reviews are not real ... so if anyone questions the validity of this review feel free to contact me as i assure you this hamburger is the real deal and i am not associated in any way with this restaurant . <sssss> did i mention that we love this burger ?! <sssss> lol

5		i went here for a girls night out . <sssss> we had some drinks at salt before hand , i recommend the bangkok monkey , and then took our drinks into the theater . <sssss> the seats were very comfy and you had a little table to set your snack/drink on . <sssss> your seats are assigned , so there was no trouble finding a seat . <sssss> only downside is it 's a little pricey . <sssss> but i think for a special night out , it 's totally worth it . <sssss> my bum had never been so comfortable in a movie theater : -rrb- 
5		i go to liberty market as often as i can . <sssss> the food here is great ! <sssss> i 've tried many things from all 3 menus and have not been disappointed by any of them ! <sssss> i 'm now also hooked on the cortadito -lrb- sp ? -rrb- <sssss> because joe bought me one just to prove how good they were ! <sssss> everyone is always friendly and the food usually comes out fast . <sssss> i really cant think of any complaints !! <sssss> keep up the good work and if you have never been here , definitely try it !! 
5		we had a great time on southwest airlines last week . <sssss> we flew up to vegs for 4 days . <sssss> even though it was a short trip , it was a good one . <sssss> the first flight we had was from phoenix to las vegas . <sssss> we were lucky enough to get on a 737 800 aircraft . <sssss> the windows were clean and big , the plane was clean and the service was nice . <sssss> happy flight attendents and a quick and fun flight . <sssss> our flight back on monday night was delayed , -lrb- but hey sometimes that happens -rrb- . <sssss> the crew did the best they could and it still a quick and very nice flight home . <sssss> the terminal in phoenix is really nice . <sssss> lots of shops and places to eat and drink as well . 
5		the best happy hour ever ! <sssss> great sushi too . 
5		peggy and i decided to try this wonderful place in the middle of a great sunday morning trifecta which involved incredible sales at nearby southwest gardener and aaron brothers . <sssss> gabby was our server , and she was very welcoming and brought one of the basic food groups -lrb- coffee -rrb- to us almost immediately upon request . <sssss> i had the cowboy breakfast -lrb- -lrb- hash browns were extra crispy as i wanted -rrb- and peggy got the cheese omelette complete with hash browns also crispy as ordered . <sssss> earl was nearby and was a joy to meet . <sssss> he was very cordial and he felt like -lrb- welcomed ! -rrb- <sssss> family from the get-go . <sssss> this will definitely be on our list of go-backs when we are around the area ... and likely even if we make the drive from ne scottsdale . <sssss> once again , a small place which emphasizes on great food and customer service . <sssss> sorry to miss out on the danish which i saw from a previous blogger was `` the best in town ! '' <sssss> dr. b 
5		i generally hate going to places that seem over hyped , so i was not really in the mood to drive 90 miles round trip to eat here . <sssss> their website boasts `` top 10 sushi spots in the united states '' by bon appetit . <sssss> fortunately , roka akor did not disappoint . <sssss> beautiful restaurant , a positive experience started at the front door as the hostess welcomed us and acted happy to see us even though it was our first time there . <sssss> she sat us at the bar at our request as we wanted to try out the happy hour menu . <sssss> we ordered the following . <sssss> sweet corn tempura $ 4 , excellent , hard to describe , just order it ! <sssss> kobe beef and kimchi dumplings $ 7.50 , excellent as well and not too spicy . <sssss> roast duck with kimchi udon $ 6 , great but really spicy butterfish tataki with white asparagus and yuzu $ 9 , small but full of flavor , delicious ! <sssss> also ordered a couple of standard sushi rolls that were good but unremarkable . <sssss> our server shana , was top notch which made our meal even more enjoyable . <sssss> overall meal including cocktails $ 110 plus tip . <sssss> oh , and do n't forget to check out the blocks of triple filtered glacier ice they use for specialty drinks that sit on the bar . <sssss> yes , i am easily entertained . 
5		have only been here twice in the last six months since we live kind of far away -lrb- cave creek -rrb- . <sssss> we love it and wish we could be closer and go more often . <sssss> this restaurant has such a good feel to it when you walk in , that good italian neighborhood place feel . <sssss> for starters , the bread and pepper olive oil is to die for , but save room for the rest of the goodies . <sssss> our last trip with 4 friends , we had oso bucco , eggplant parm , lasagna , shrimp with pasta and broccolini/sausage ravioli . <sssss> my husband had the oso bucco and he thought it needed more flavor , a little bland for his taste . <sssss> however , the rest of the entrees all got high reviews . <sssss> my lasagna friend who is fussy , said it was excellent lasagna , my shrimp friend who is also very fussy , said the shrimp and pasta were wonderful . <sssss> my sister had the eggplant and she said it is one of the best she ever had . <sssss> now me , both times i have had their ravioli special , butternut squash and this time the broccolini and sausage . <sssss> i can not say enough about their ravs . <sssss> awesome !! <sssss> myrah -lrb- one of the owners -rrb- is always very pleasant and wants to make sure all is well at your table . <sssss> she must get tired of all the ny stories she hears . <sssss> lol the wine was good and i always enjoy my salmbucca -lrb- sp -rrb- after dinner with 3 coffee beans . <sssss> also save room for cannolis !! <sssss> the best ! <sssss> would love to try one of the out the back door pizzas some time ! <sssss> looking forward to our next trip back , worth the drive . 
5		amazing food ! <sssss> amazing service ! <sssss> i love cafe norsdrom . <sssss> the quality of food is a + and service can not be beat ! 
5		about a month ago my car got wrecked in an accident that was n't my fault . <sssss> even though the other drivers insurance takes care of repairs and a rental car . <sssss> it 's still very upsetting to be without your car for an extended period of time . <sssss> a friend recommended that i take my car to sterling for the repairs . <sssss> sterling was completely professional , gave me nearly daily updates via text , and called me multiple times each week to update me on the status of my repairs . <sssss> when all was said and done , the repairs were completed nearly a week early . <sssss> when i went to pick up my car , everyone was extremely friendly and helpful , explained what was repaired , handed me some paperwork and my keys and i was on my way and back to normal . <sssss> utter professionalism and quality service . 
5		what a simple breakfast menu and yet the food taste nowhere near simple ! <sssss> there was just something about the food that made it one of the best breakfasts i have ever had !! 
5		just finished anton 's spinach . <sssss> awesome . <sssss> i regularly do my own juicing so really can appreciate the quality of their product and the fact that i did n't have to go thru all that work . <sssss> if you do n't have a juicer , just buy it from kaleidoscope ! 
5		stayed here two times . <sssss> great place . <sssss> the rooms are set up well and very spacious . <sssss> this time we stayed there 's my grandmother was passing away . <sssss> they extended our reservations four times . <sssss> the service was great . <sssss> we stay in a lot of resident inns and this one has the best room arrangements and the best oatmeal . 
5		new restaurant opened in the mall so i decided to try it out . <sssss> first thing is that i 've never had persian or middle eastern food before . <sssss> they brought out a few dishes for us to try for free . <sssss> the dishes were good but different one was a persian salad with some hummus and some ground beef and rice rolls . <sssss> the dish i choose was a spiced chicken and rice dish . <sssss> was amazing . <sssss> our server let us know what was in each dish and also how to pronounce some of the stuff and provided a great service . <sssss> good place if your a fan of the middle eastern food or are looking for a new place to try . <sssss> i know im gon na be going there again soon ! 
5		the chile rellenos are awesome ! <sssss> -- order it `` rainbow , and you 'll get both red and green sauce !

5		awesome service and amazing red velvet flavor !! <sssss> yummmy !! <sssss> :-rrb- plus !! <sssss> you get a free bowl when you check in with yelp , up to five dollars worth , how amazing is that ???!!! <sssss> very , very amazing !! <sssss> the girl there was super nice and informative , she mentioned that its locally owned and they only aloha yogurt in arizona . <sssss> not only is it amazing on its own for being locally owned , but the flavors , oh how deliciously addicting . <sssss> i could not stop eating from my bowl , the ghirardelli chocolate , raspberry , oreo cookie and of course , the amazing red velvet were all so satisfying !!! <sssss> they were all truly perfect and delightful , and even better when paired with the right toppings , like the mango , for the raspberry , and the oreo dust for the chocolate and oreo cookie flavor !! <sssss> so for the next time that i find myself around this area , i will not hesitate to stop by aloha to again experience the most amazing frozen yogurt tempe has to offer !! <sssss> : -rrb- 
5		the pollo rico is our favorite , what makes this dish so good is the jalepeno cream cheese ... get extra on the side ! 
5		we come back every time ! <sssss> love the staff and food : -rrb-
